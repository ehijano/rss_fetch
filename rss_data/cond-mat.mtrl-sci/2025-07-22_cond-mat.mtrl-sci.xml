      <title>The fracture toughness of molybdenum at different grain sizes under and since brittle-ductile transition: computer modeling and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharp growth of the fracture toughness after brittle-ductile transition happens at grain sizes approximately equal to the plastic zone size. Here we analyze the influence of the grain boundary on the evolution of the ensemble of dislocations near the crack tip using dislocation dynamics method. We show evidence that for large grain sizes, the size has little effect on the ensemble of dislocations and the fracture toughness, but when dislocations reach the grain boundary, distribution of dislocations changes, which leads to increase of the fracture toughness.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital and spin magnetization in trigonal tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital effects, despite their fundamental significance and potential to engender novel physical phenomena and enable new applications, have long been underexplored compared to their spin counterparts. Recently, surging interest in the orbital degree of freedom has led to the discovery of a plethora of orbital-related effects, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of their roles in quantum materials. Here, we report first experimental signatures of orbital magnetization in trigonal Tellurium, an elemental semiconductor with a unique helical crystal structure that serves as a natural platform for investigating orbital effects. Detailed angular dependent linear and nonlinear magnetotransport measurements, supported by theoretical Boltzmann transport analysis, reveal the coexistence of current-induced spin polarization and orbital magnetization. By disentangling the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom, this work establishes a general framework for understanding orbital magnetization in chiral crystals and beyond, paving the way for its utilization in orbitronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Phonon Weyl points and chiral edge modes with unconventional Fermi arcs in NbSi$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NbSi$_{2}$ crystallizes in the P6$_{2}$22 symmetry, featuring chiral chains of Si atoms. The absence of inversion symmetry, combined with its chiral structure, gives arise to unique physical properties. The breaking of inversion symmetry leads to the emergence of Weyl points, while the chiral structure enables the formation of chiral edge modes. As a result, NbSi$_{2}$ serves as an ideal platform for exploring the interplay between phonon Weyl points and chiral phonon edge modes. For example, we identify the presence of a structure consisting of three Weyl points with a Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = +1$ around the $\bar{\text{K}}$ point. These nodes form unconventional Fermi arcs connecting the $\bar{\Gamma}$ or $\bar{\text{K}}$ points, which mimic an effective Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = -2$.</description>

      <title>Segregation and Ordering of Light Interstitials (B, C, H, and N) in Cr-Ni Alloys: Implications for Grain Boundary Stability in Superalloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segregation and ordering behavior of light interstitials (B, C, and N) in Cr30-Ni is examined, as these elements are critical for grain boundary stability and high-temperature mechanical performance in Ni-based superalloys. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we identify the chemical and structural preferences of these interstitials in both bulk and grain boundary (GB) environments, aligning with experimental segregation and precipitation trends. Boron strongly prefers GBs over the bulk, where it enhances GB cohesion and stabilizes the GB structure. Uniquely, boron induces a structural transformation at higher concentrations, hinting at the formation of serrated GBs where boron content is high, which improves high-temperature mechanical performance. Carbon and nitrogen form carbide and nitride motifs and exhibit limited GB solubility, reinforcing their precipitation tendencies. In support of ongoing hydrogen embrittlement mitigation strategies, we also examined hydrogen behavior. Hydrogen demonstrated chemical stability in the Cr-Ni GB zone, suggesting it may preferentially migrate inward along Cr- and Ni-rich GBs while avoiding Mo-enriched regions, further supporting Mo's role in mitigating embrittlement. These findings suggest that Mo-containing borides may serve as effective barriers against hydrogen-induced degradation by inhibiting H ingress and stabilizing GB cohesion. By elucidating the chemical and structural preferences of these light interstitials, this work provides a robust computational framework for guiding superalloy design toward improved high-temperature grain boundary stability, resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, and controlled chemical ordering.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Short-range Ordering with Light Interstitials in Inconel Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employed hybrid Monte Carlo Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the short-range ordering behavior of Ni-based superalloys doped with boron or carbon. The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon dissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering with Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr, while carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and with Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were observed, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral sites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to the vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly, carbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations showed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their short-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was more likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This shift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide formation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the development of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based carbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries and impeding crack propagation. These effects further underscore the impact of interstitial-induced ordering on phase stability and microstructural evolution. This work provides an atomistic perspective on how boron- and carbon-induced ordering influences microstructure and mechanical properties. These findings highlight the critical role of interstitial-induced short-range ordering and demonstrate that this mechanism can be leveraged as a design principle to fine-tune alloy microstructures for specific engineering applications.</description>

      <title>New metastable ice phases via supercooled water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water exhibits rich polymorphism, where more than 20 crystalline phases have been experimentally reported. Five of them are metastable and form at low temperatures by either heating amorphous ice or degassing clathrate hydrates. However, such metastable phases rarely crystallise directly from liquid water, making it challenging to study metastable phase relations at relatively high temperatures. Here, we report that high-pressure metastable phases of ice, including two unknown phases named ices XXI and XXII, crystallise directly from liquid water in a deeply supercooled region around the homogeneous nucleation temperature. The key is to use emulsified water to stabilise supercooled water in laboratory timescales. Ices XXI and XXII are obtained by isothermal compression of emulsified water at 295 K and 250 K, respectively. Our powder x-ray and neutron diffraction analyses combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the surprisingly complex structures of these new phases with Z = 152 (ice XXI) and 304 (ice XXII). Ice XXI is topologically identical to 'ice T2' previously predicted by MD simulations, and our experimental structural model can be used as a benchmark for its structures in simulations, which depend on the force fields. On cooling, ice XXI transforms into an orientationally ordered counterpart named ice XXIII. Our results revealed the "hidden" structural complexity of water underlying the phase diagram, as implied by previous computational works. Further efforts at unveiling such metastable phase relations will bridge the large gaps between computational and experimental phase diagrams of water.</description>

      <title>Phonon density of states of magnetite (\ce{Fe3O4}) nanoparticles via molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of magnetite nanoparticles, systematically evaluating a range of force fields against experimental results. We analyze the influence of particle size, temperature, and surface-adsorbed water molecules on the structural and dynamic properties of the nanoparticles. We performed classical molecular dynamics of nanoparticles and bulk magnetite and utilized density functional theory calculations for bulk magnetite for comparison. Our results reveal that nanoparticle size and the presence of adsorbed water molecules have a pronounced impact on the density of states. Specifically, as the nanoparticle size is decreased, phonon modes exhibit significant broadening and softening, which is attributable to reduced phonon lifetimes resulting from enhanced boundary scattering. The incorporation of water further broadens the density of states and extends the spectra to higher energy regions. Temperature variations result in a slight broadening and softening of the phonon density of states, particularly in the oxygen-dominated region, which is attributed to phonon anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Tunable exchange bias in Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ film on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ grown on the (001) surface of paramagnetic Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ experiences an exchange bias field, which has been attributed to the magnetism of an interface layer between the two materials. We report here that when grown using sputtering and with lower post-annealing temperatures than in previous works, the blocking temperature of the interface magnetic layer is lowered to about 7 K, while still displaying a strong exchange bias. This exchange bias is then found to be tunable between its two extreme values by carefully varying the field cooling protocol. This is attributed to a slow and complex dynamics of the spins of the interface-layer when it is warmed up close to its blocking (or melting) temperature, which is reminiscent of a spin glass.</description>

      <title>Possible Orthorhombic Phase of Ta$_2$O$_5$ under High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential orthorhombic phase of Ta$_2$O$_5$, designated as Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$, is predicted under high-pressure conditions through density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with structural search algorithms. This phase, consisting of four formula units per unit cell ($Z = 4$), exhibits the highest known Ta-O coordination numbers. Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$ is found to be the most energetically favorable form of Ta$_2$O$_5$ in the pressure range of approximately 70 GPa to at least 200 GPa. Both standard DFT-GGA and higher-accuracy GW calculations reveal that Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap. Additionally, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) introduce nontrivial corrections to external pressure at fixed volumes, underscoring their significance in high-pressure phase stability analyses.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking strain drives significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity: A case study of boron arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that cubic boron arsenide (BAs) exhibits a non-monotonic pressure dependence of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) under isotropic strain. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we unveil that uniaxial tensile strain induces a monotonic reduction in the $\kappa_{\rm L}$ of BAs -- a striking contrast to the isotropic scenario. The results show that applying uniaxial (100) strain leads to the lifting of phonon band degeneracy, accompanied by an overall softening of the phonon spectrum. These modifications significantly increase phonon-phonon scattering channels by facilitating the fulfillment of selection rules, resulting in a concurrent increase in both three- and four-phonon scattering rates. Consequently, $\kappa_{\rm L}$ exhibits a dramatic suppression of nearly 80\% under large tension at room temperature. Meanwhile, we unexpectedly observe that the uniaxial strain suppresses $\kappa_{\rm L}$ much more strongly in the direction perpendicular to the strain than along the stretching direction. This work establishes the fundamental understanding of the thermal conductivity behavior of BAs under uniaxial strain and opens a promising avenue for manipulating solid-state heat transport by tuning crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator transition and Charge Transport Mechanisms in SnSe$_2$ Field-Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an observation of metal-insulator transition in a thin film of SnSe$_2$. The room-temperature carrier concentration of SnSe$_2$ film was increased by electrostatic doping to 1.14$\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. A crossover from insulating phase to metallic state was clearly observed. The low-temperature charge transport mechanism is governed by two-dimensional (2D) variable-range hopping. This mechanism is influenced by band bending and gap states introduced by selenium vacancies. At low temperatures, the mobility is primarily limited by charged impurities, while at higher temperatures, it follows a power-law dependence, $\mu = T^{-\gamma}$, indicating a dominance of electron-phonon scattering. The application of a gate field shifts the Fermi level toward the conduction band, and at sufficiently high temperatures, this drives the system into a metallic state. Our findings offer insights into the charge transport mechanisms in SnSe$_2$ FET, this understanding will allow for the optimization of other 2D materials for advanced electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Swift heavy ion track formation in SiC films under high-temperature irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resistance of bulk silicon carbide (SiC) to impacts of swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating at room temperature in the electronic stopping regime is well known. However, the effect of the SiC film thickness on the formation and structure of SHI tracks over a wide range of irradiation temperatures remains unexplored. To address this disadvantage, we utilize a model sensitive to irradiation temperature that describes all stages of ion track formation: from material excitation, considering the emission of excited electrons from the film surface (MC code TREKIS-3), to the reaction of the material's atomic system to the excitation (classical molecular dynamics). We observed the formation of two different types of nanostructures on the surface of SiC films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm when irradiated with 710 MeV Bi ions: craters and hills. The type of nanostructure formed depended on the irradiation temperature. The transition irradiation temperature ($T_{tr}$) from hills to craters grows with the film thickness and follows an empirical relation $T_{tr}=T_{tr}^{cr} \left(1-\left(1+\left(L/L_{cr} \right)^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \right)$ with $T_{tr}^{cr}=1534$ K and $L_{cr}=2.8$ nm. That means such a transition should occur in bulk SiC at the irradiation temperature of $\approx 1534$ K.</description>

      <title>Investigation on high-order planar Hall effect in trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trigonal PtBi$_2$ (t-PtBi$_2$) as a Weyl semimetal possessing triply degenerate points in its electronic bands near the Fermi level endows it with rich electronic properties. Previous studies have already measured the planar Hall effect (PHE) and in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of t-PtBi$_2$. We noticed that their experimental results exhibited high-order features in both the PHE and AMR, yet these features were not systematically investigated. In our work, we conducted more systematic measurements and analyses of the PHE and AMR in t-PtBi$_2$. Both PHE and AMR show high-order features under low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, and these features share a similar temperature and magnetic field dependence with the turn-on behavior of resistance and temperature curves, indicating a common physical origin for them. We further summarize the critical conditions for the emergence of high-order PHE in t-PtBi$_2$, which will help to understand the origin of high-order features. In addition, we performed computational simulations on the AMR of t-PtBi$_2$, and the results were consistent with the experiments, indicating the high-order features are the result of the combined contribution of the Fermi surface anisotropy and the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins of high-order features in non-magnetic topological materials.</description>

In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature dependence of local magnetic fields in altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel type of magnetic system that has a spin-polarised electric band structure in the absence of a net magnetic moment, leading to exciting prospects in potential device applications. Hexagonal MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, has arguably shown the most properties consistent with theoretical predictions, including an anomalous Hall effect despite no net magnetisation, and strong altermagnet-induced spin splitting in the electronic band structure. Here we present muon-spin spectroscopy measurements of a single crystal of MnTe. Below room temperature we observe pronounced anomalies in the muon-spin depolarisation, as well as the onset of a second, non-proportional internal field in the absence of an applied field. These findings point to a change in the magnetic structure around $T\simeq250$ K, which coincides with other changes in reported properties, such as transport.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Lattice Pseudosymmetry for Frustrated Decahedral Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a widespread phenomenon in physics, materials science, and biology, occurring when the geometry of a system prevents local interactions from being all accommodated. The resulting manifold of nearly degenerate configurations can lead to complex collective behaviors and emergent pseudosymmetry in diverse systems such as frustrated magnets, mechanical metamaterials, and protein assemblies. In synthetic multi-twinned nanomaterials, similar pseudosymmetric features have also been observed and manifest as intrinsic lattice strain. Despite extensive interest in the stability of these nanostructures, a fundamental understanding remains limited due to the lack of detailed structural characterization across varying sizes and geometries. In this work, we apply four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy strain mapping over a total of 23 decahedral nanoparticles with edge lengths, d, between 20 and 55 nm. From maps of full 2D strain tensor at nanometer spatial resolution, we reveal the prevalence of heterogeneity in different modes of lattice distortions, which homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. Knowing the particle crystallography, we reveal distinctive spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries, with a contrast between particles below and above d of 35 nm. The results suggest a cross-over size of the internal structure occurs, as particles shape transition from modified-Wulff shape favored at nanoscale to faceted, pentagonal bipyramidal shape. Ultimately, our 4D-STEM mapping provides new insight to long-standing mysteries of this historic system and can be widely applicable to study nanocrystalline solids and material phase transformation that are important in catalysis, metallurgy, electronic devices, and energy storage materials.</description>

      <title>Broad-band THz emission by Spin-to-Charge Conversion in Topological Material -- Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz spintronic devices combine ultrafast operation with low power consumption, making them strong candidates for next-generation memory technologies. In this study, we use time-domain terahertz emission spectroscopy to investigate spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) in bilayer heterostructures comprising topological insulators (TIs) or Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with ferromagnetic metals (FMs). SCC is studied in TI materials \ce{Bi2Se3}, Pb-doped \ce{Bi2Se3}, and (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$, and the WSM NbP. Our results reveal that the dependence of SCC on TI thickness varies with interface quality, indicating that thickness dependence alone is not a reliable criterion for distinguishing between inverse spin Hall effect and the inverse Rashba--Edelstein effect mechanisms. We find efficient SCC in TIs depends on both \textit{in-situ} growth to prevent surface oxidation and proper composition. In NbP$\vert$FM bilayers, we observe THz emission with efficiency and bandwidth comparable to that of TIs, highlighting the broader potential of topological materials. Finally, broadband spectral measurements demonstrate that both TIs and WSMs can generate THz pulses with frequencies extending up to 8\,THz. These findings underscore the promise of topological materials as efficient platforms for ultrafast, broadband spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Power Factor Enhancement and Local Structural Transition in Ni-Doped TiCoSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significant enhancement (~269%) in the power factor (PF) and a local structural transition in Ni-doped TiCoSb samples (TiCo_{1-x}Ni_xSb, (x= 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06). First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Study of the Electronic Structure and Thermoelectric Properties of Heusler Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heusler alloys were discovered in 1903, and materials with half-metallic characteristics have drawn more attention from researchers since the advances in semiconductor industry. Heusler alloys have found application as spin-filters, tunnel junctions or giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices in technological applications. In this work, the electronic structures, phonon dispersion, thermal properties, and electrical conductivities of PdMnSn and six novel alloys (AuCrSn, AuMnGe, Au2MnSn, Cu2NiGe, Pd2NiGe and Pt2CoSn) along with their magnetic moments are studied using ab initio calculations to understand the roots of half-metallicity in these alloys of Heusler family. From the phonon dispersion, the thermodynamic stability of the alloys in their respective phases is assessed. Phonon modes were also used to further understand the electrical transport in the crystals of these seven alloys. This study evaluates the relationship between materials' electrical conductivity and minority-spin bandgap in the band structure, and it provides suggestions for selecting constituent elements when designing new half-metallic Heusler alloys of C1b and L21 structures.</description>

      <title>Energy Underprediction from Symmetry in Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $&gt;$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetization dynamics driven by the femtosecond laser pulse of antiferromagnet van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr is studied within time-dependent density functional theory. We investigate the effect of laser fluence as well as the excitation frequency on the ultrafast dynamics of spins. In low fluence, the local magnetic moment of Cr increases when the laser frequency is below the band gap, whereas it decreases when the laser frequency is below the band gap. In high fluence, we find strong demagnetization independent of excitation frequency. We find that the ultrafast demagnetization in CrSBr is dominated by intralayer and interlayer optical intersite spin transfer, and spin flip via the spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role. Our results reveal hole excitation in the low-fluence regime and electron excitation in the high-fluence regime. Further, we investigate the effect of the external static magnetic field on the dynamics. We demonstrate even and odd high harmonic generation in the local magnetic moments and electric current, respectively. The external magnetic field results in an out-of-plane charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect as well as odd harmonics in the local magnetic moment dynamics as a result of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Engineering Spin Splitting in Antiferromagnets by Superatoms with Internal Degree of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superatoms, stable atomic clusters acting as building blocks for new materials, offer unique opportunities due to their rich properties and potential for 2D material assembly. While extensive research has focused on their similarities to ordinary atoms, the role of their internal degrees of freedom (IDOF) remains largely unexplored. Concurrently, compensated antiferromagnets (AFMs) with intrinsic spin-split band structures have emerged as a promising class of materials for spintronics, yet their experimental realization, particularly in two dimensions, is limited. Here, we bridge these two fields by proposing a novel strategy to achieve spin-split AFMs using superatoms with IDOFs. We establish our core concept using a simple model, demonstrating how superatom IDOFs can be leveraged to engineer system symmetry and induce spin splitting in AFM states. We concretely illustrate this strategy by first-principles calculations on a Mo-decorated carborophene sheets, constructed from closo-carborane superatoms. We show that the distinct IDOFs of carborane isomers (electric-dipole-like and nematic) are critical in determining the symmetry of the resulting 2D superatomic crystal and, consequently, the spin splitting pattern of its AFM states. Our findings underscore the profound significance of superatom IDOFs-a feature absent in ordinary atoms-and introduce a new paradigm for engineering spin splitting in AFM lattices. This work opens novel avenues for the design of advanced spintronic and quantum materials based on superatoms.</description>

      <title>High pressure and temperature thermoelasticity of hcp osmium from ab initio quasi-harmonic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic ab initio study of the thermoelastic properties of hcp osmium as functions of temperature and pressure within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). The precision of the Zero Static Internal Stress Approximation (ZSISA) and of the volume-constrained ZSISA (V-ZSISA) are rigorously assessed. For osmium, we find negligible deviations between ZSISA and a full free energy minimization (FFEM) approach. Also, the V-ZSISA approximation influences the results very little, as we found already in beryllium, despite the markedly different behavior of the c/a ratio with temperature in the two metals. Our QHA-derived ECs show excellent agreement with available experimental data in the temperature range of 5-301 K, outperforming the results obtained from the quasi-static approximation (QSA). Additionally, we report the pressure-dependent QHA ECs at 5 K, 301 K, and 1000 K, spanning pressures from 0 to 150 kbar.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Low-Spin State Destabilization and Piezo-Chromic Effect in an Iron(II) Spin Crossover Complex with Pyrazol-Pyridine-Triazolate Coordination Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly developing science and technology demand new materials with versatile and promising properties for practical applications. In this context, pseudo-octahedral iron(II) spin crossover (SCO) complexes are particularly appealing - not only for their fundamental scientific interest but also for their potential as key components in the development of multifunctional switchable molecular materials and novel technological applications. This work presents the synthesis and structure of a new mononuclear SCO complex [FeII(L)2]0*nMeOH (n = 2, 0) where L is the asymmetrically substituted tridentate ligand [4-trifluoromethylphenyl-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine]. Due to high trigonal distortion, the solvated form (n = 2) remains high spin (HS) at all temperatures. In contrast, the more regular Oh geometry of the unsolvated form, 4CF3, favors a complete spin transition (ST) at room temperature, which has been investigated, in the pressure interval 0-0.64 GPa, by means of its magnetic and optical properties. Contrary to intuition and experience, the increase of pressure on 4CF3 denotes a radically abnormal behavior of this ST, involving: i) decrease of the characteristic temperatures, ii) increase of the high-spin molar fraction in the temperature range where the low-spin state is stable at ambient pressure; iii) increase of the thermal hysteresis width; and iv) above certain threshold pressure, full stabilization of the high-spin state. All these observations have been explained in the framework of a thermodynamic that model based on the elastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultrafast photoacoustic transduction on Tantalum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\gamma}-ray generation is presented.</description>

      <title>Simphony: A full tight-binding package for lattice vibrations and topological phonon analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simphony is an open-source software package designed for the topological analysis of lattice vibrations based on Wannier tight-binding models. Its primary function is to classify the topology of novel materials by computing bulk and slab phonon band structures, extracting phonon surface spectra, and providing analysis tools such as Wilson loop calculations and Weyl node detection. The workflow is analogous to that of established electronic topology codes like Wannier90 and WannierTools. It also incorporates long-range polar interactions during the wannierization process, making Simphony one of the first tools capable of diagnosing topology in polar insulators.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge density wave in two-dimensional altermagnet WO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study of novel physical properties arising from the combination of altermagnetism and other matter phases has attracted widespread attention, such as the integration of altermagnetism and topology. However, research on the combination of altermagnetism and charge density waves remains relatively sparse. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate for the first time that altermagnetism and charge density waves can coexist in a two-dimensional material and predict monolayer WO to be such a material. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the altermagnetic order in monolayer WO stabilizes the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave. Further, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave is not driven by Fermi-surface nesting but rather by strong electron-phonon coupling. More importantly, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave in monolayer WO leads to an anomalous transition from semimetal to metal. Therefore, we realize an anomalous charge density wave phase in altermagnetic WO. Considering the strong electron-phonon coupling and good metallic properties in the altermagnetic charge density wave state, our work may provide new insights into the realization of nontrivial altermagnetic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Novel High-performance Quaternary Chalcogenide Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic materials facilitate the conversion of sunlight into electricity by harnessing the interaction between light and matter, offering an eco-friendly and cost-efficient energy solution. Combining data-driven approaches with static and time-dependent density functional theories and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we predict 14 high-performance photoabsorber materials from a family of known quaternary semiconductors. Among these, we investigate four compounds - SrCuGdSe3, SrCuDyTe3, BaCuLaSe3, and BaCuLaTe3 in greater detail. Hybrid density functional theory calculations including spin-orbit coupling reveal that SrCuGdSe3, SrCuDyTe3, BaCuLaSe3 and BaCuLaTe3 possess direct band gaps of 1.65, 1.79, 1.05, and 1.01 eV, respectively. These band gap values lie close to an optimal range ideal for visible-light absorption. Consequently, the calculated optical absorption coefficient and spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency for these compounds become comparable or larger than crystalline silicon, GaAs, and methylammonium lead iodide. Calculated exciton binding energies for these compounds are relatively small (30-32 meV), signifying easy separation of the electron-hole pairs, and hence enhanced power conversion efficiencies. Investigations of photoexcited carrier dynamics reveal a relatively long carrier lifetime (~ 30-40 ns), suggesting suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced photo-conversion efficiencies. We further determined the defect formation energies in these compounds, which showed that despite the likely formation of cation vacancies and interstitial defects, midgap states remain absent making these defects non-detrimental to carrier recombination. Our theoretical predictions invite experimental verification and encourage further investigations of these and similar compounds in this quaternary semiconductor family.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co partitioning to the {\gamma} matrix on the microstructural stablity of a Ti-rich Ni-Base Superalloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructural stability and mechanical properties of superalloys at high temperatures are significantly influenced by the composition and nature of the solutes they contain. Most of the alloys with high solvus temperature have higher gamma prime coarsening resistance, while the larger lattice misfit is attributed to higher gamma prime coarsening rate. In this work, we explore the influence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical properties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of partitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes across the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening resistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in the Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime solvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better microstructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and CALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma matrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the gamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime coarsening behavior in the alloy. The observed behavior was rationlised by the proposition of a simplistic unified coarsening rate expression that successfully decouples thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. Additionally, we also observe that the gamma prime volume fraction dominates over the gamma prime precipitate size on the 0.2% yield strength (YS) of the alloys.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative macroscopic theory of interfaces with discontinuous dielectric constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. It gives rise to a divergence of the self-interaction potential acting on a charge near the interface, and it presents an obstruction to a perturbative description. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the electron energy spectrum in the interface quantum well, as well as the dependence of these two phenomena on the interface parameter W.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio exploration of Gd monolayer interfaced with WSe$_2$: from electronic and magnetic properties to the anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures involving transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted significant research interest due to the richness and versatility of the underlying physical phenomena. In this work, we investigate a heterostructure consisting of a rare-earth material, specifically a Gd monolayer, interfaced with WSe$_2$. We explore its electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport behavior, with particular emphasis on the emergence of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Both Gd and W are heavy elements, providing strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which plays a crucial role in triggering the AHE. The combination of strong SOC and inversion symmetry breaking leads to pronounced asymmetries between the $\Gamma-K$ and $\Gamma-K^\prime$ directions in the Brillouin zone. Our calculations reveal a substantial anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) at the ferromagnetic interface, primarily originating from numerous avoided crossings involving the d-states of both Gd and W near the Fermi level. Moreover, we demonstrate that the AHC is highly tunable, either by adjusting the in-plane lattice constant or by reducing the separation between Gd and WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Giant Reversible Piezoelectricity from Symmetry-Governed Stochastic Dipole Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic--inorganic hybrid perovskites with giant piezoelectric responses, exemplified by TMCM-CdCl$_3$, represent a promising platform for flexible and environmentally friendly electromechanical materials. However, the microscopic origin of such exceptional performance in this weakly polar system has remained elusive. Here, using deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we resolve this paradox by reproducing the experimentally measured piezoelectric coefficient $d_{33} \approx 220$~pC/N, and demonstrating that the giant response arises from the collective contribution of multiple intrinsic components, particularly the shear component $d_{15}$. This effect does not stem from conventional polarization rotation or phase switching, but instead originates from stochastic 120$^\circ$ in-plane rotational hopping of a small fraction of organic cations. This discrete hopping mechanism is governed by the local C$_3$-symmetric halogen-bonding network between the host framework and the guest cation. The Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of $d_{15}$ further confirms the role of thermally activated dipole hopping. This work provides a clear pathway to enhance piezoelectric performance of hybrid materials through rational engineering of host--guest interactions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of hydrogen diffusion and trapping in ferritic steels containing (Ti,Cr)C particles using electrochemical permeation and thermal desorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen diffusion and trapping in ferritic steels containing (Ti,Cr)C particles was investigated using electrochemical permeation (EP) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The trapping parameters for the test materials were evaluated by fitting the measurements with a finite element model based on the McNabb-Foster equations using least-squares optimisation. The measurements showed that hydrogen diffusion in ferrite is slowed significantly by the presence of fine (&lt;5 nm) (Ti,Cr)C particles; coarser particles had little or no effect. The TDS measurements were consistent with hydrogen traps with a high energy barrier. The uniqueness of the hydrogen trapping parameters obtained using the fitting procedure was evaluated. It was found that the system was overdetermined; the measurements could be fitted with multiple combinations of trapping parameters. Consequently, it was not possible to determine the individual trapping parameters using this procedure. Trapping parameters were also evaluated from TDS measurements by applying Kissinger's equation. Using this procedure a trap binding energy of 0.24 eV was calculated for all materials, albeit with a high degree of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Fully atomic layer deposited transparent carrier selective contacts for bifacial Cd-free Cu2ZnSnSe4 thin-film solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film solar cells based on kesterite (Cu2ZnSnSe4) material are a promising alternative for photovoltaic devices due to their composition consisting of earth abundant elements, ease of production at a relatively low temperatures and excellent optical absorption properties. Additionally, this absorber compound allows a tuneable bandgap energy in the 1 to 1.5 eV window range, which makes it an attractive candidate either as a top or a bottom solar cell in tandem technologies combined with transparent carrier-selective contacts. However, conventional kesterite devices use a toxic CdS layer as an electron-selective contact, resulting in the difficultto-dispose chemical waste. This work explores the use of a stack of ZnO and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films deposited by ALD to replace the CdS-based contacts in kesterite devices. The inclusion of a polyethylenimine (PEI) interlayer as dipole to enhance the overall electrical contact performance is also discussed. The transparent back contact is formed by an ALD V2Ox thin layer over a FTO conductive electrode. Fabricated kesterite solar cells exhibit remarkable photocurrent density values of 35 mAcm-2, open-circuit voltage around 260 mV and efficiencies up to 3.5% using front illumination. The aforementioned photovoltaic parameters yield to 5.3 mAcm-2, 160 mV and 0.3% respectively under back illumination, demonstrating the bifaciality of the proposed structure.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave in intermetallic oxides R$_5$Pb$_3$O (R = La and Ce)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R$_5$Pb$_3$O family was discovered decades ago, but has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report single crystal growth and basic characterization for the La and Ce members of this family. At room temperature, these compounds adopt a tetragonal structure (I4/mcm), where R and Pb atoms form linear chains along the c-axis. We identify a second-order structural phase transition at 260 K and 145 K for R = La and Ce, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a lattice modulation below the transition temperature, resulting in R-Pb pairs in the z direction. The broken symmetry in the low-temperature phases results in a primitive structure with space group P4/ncc. Transport and diffraction measurements, in agreement with density functional theory calculations, support that the R$_5$Pb$_3$O (R = La and Ce) series hosts an electron-phonon coupling driven charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures. The CDW ordering temperature is suppressed by more than 100 K by the La to Ce substitution, suggesting high pressure-sensitivity. Therefore, this family offers the potential for investigating competing orders in oxides, with heavier rare-earth members still to be explored.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Nanoscale Friction on Illite Clay: Effects of Solvent Salt Ions and Electric Double Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quick clay is a highly sensitive soil that transforms rapidly from solid to liquid under minor stress, as a result of long-term salt leaching that drastically reduces shear strength. Stabilizing it is both costly and carbon-intensive, significantly impacting construction emissions in regions like Norway. Developing greener stabilization methods is challenging due to limited understanding of the weakening mechanisms and the specific roles of different salts. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the sliding behavior of illite platelets, the key component in Norwegian quick clay, and how it is affected by the different ions in the solution surrounding the surface. We examine the impact of monovalent (NaCl, KCl, CsCl) and divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) salts on platelet-surface interactions, focusing on the friction enhancement brought by divalent salts and how the electric double layer (EDL) structure mediates frictional behavior. We find that divalent cations sit higher on top of the surface, and lead to an increase in friction, while monovalent cations sit closer to the surface. By providing a detailed analysis of these interactions, the study offers a novel framework for understanding the role of salts in clay mechanics and highlights opportunities to design environmentally friendly stabilizers as alternatives to traditional lime and cement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow of time moves in one direction in any spatial position and orientation in this universe. Chiral objects, which lack mirror symmetry, retain their chirality regardless of their position or orientation. Despite being seemingly independent, time and chirality share common features such as universality -- applying to 'any position and orientation' -- and a binary nature, such as forward/backward time flow versus left/right chirality. We introduce the concept of Time Chirality and discuss the conjugate relationship between time chirality and traditional chirality. We explore how time chirality can manifest in certain magnetic states, and examine the novel physical phenomena associated with time-chiral magnetic states. This discussion offers a fresh perspective on true time reversal symmetry breaking and temporal nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Hardware Security Primitives: Embedding Data Protection at the Material Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Big Data revolution has heightened the demand for robust, energy-efficient security hardware capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional encryption schemes, reliant on complex algorithms, are resource-intensive and remain vulnerable. To fortify sensitive information, society needs innovative anti-hacking and anti-counterfeiting technologies that exploit new materials and designs. Here, we present a magneto-ionic strategy for hardware-level security based on fully selective voltage-controlled N3- ion migration within pre-defined, initially paramagnetic FeCoN dots. This process generates ferromagnetic sublayers of tuneable thickness, resulting in either deterministic (single-domain or vortex) or probabilistic states (with coexisting magnetic configurations and voltage-adjustable probabilities), each exhibiting stochastic orientation and chirality, thereby providing a rich platform for magnetic fingerprinting. This approach enables self-protected primitives, including true random number generators, physical unclonable functions, and in-memory probabilistic inference. The resulting reconfigurable architecture combines tamper resistance, low energy consumption, and scalability, marking a significant leap toward next-generation hardware security rooted in emergent magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>A million-scale dataset and generalizable foundation model for nanomaterial-protein interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</description>

      <title>DREAMS: Density Functional Theory Based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally, DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput, high-fidelity computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Algorithms for the Fitting of Tessellations to 3D Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming, stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent -- for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams (GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application needs.</description>

      <title>Excitonic contributions to dark matter-electron scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine whether excitonic effects affect predictions of dark matter (DM)-electron scattering rates by calculating the energy- and momentum-dependent energy-loss function, including electron-hole interaction excitonic effects, for the dark-matter scintillating detector materials GaAs and NaI. By comparing our results using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which explicitly includes excitonic effects, with those using the quasiparticle random-phase approximation, which includes only electron-electron interaction and crystal local-field effects, we find that excitonic effects in NaI significantly increase the predicted scattering rate at low energy and as a result improve the cross-section sensitivity considering a realistic background. In contrast, the predicted scattering rate and the DM-electron scattering cross-section for GaAs are minimally affected by excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Giant Enhancement of the Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases at KTaO3 (111) Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent phenomenon in noncentrosymmetric systems, enables the generation of a transverse voltage without an external magnetic field through a second-order electrical response. However, achieving a sizable NLHE signal remains a critical challenge for its application in frequency-doubling and rectifying devices. Here, we report a light-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the second harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\omega} y) increases substantially and undergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse conductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1 omega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew scattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable via optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the higher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that significantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a dramatic enhancement of {\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further reveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly depends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the Ta 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign change, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the nonlinear Hall response. Our work offers a new strategy to optically boost and tune the nonlinear Hall effect in oxide 2DEG systems, paving the way for applications in light-controlled rectification and nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropy of Thermal Activation Energy of 2H-NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic flux dynamics in 2H-NbS$_2$ single crystals through temperature-dependent resistance measurements under in-plane ($H \parallel ab$ plane) and out-of-plane ($H \perp ab$ plane) magnetic fields. Analysis of thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) resistance in the superconducting mixed state reveals stark contrasts in thermal activation energy ($U_0$) scaling and field dependence. For $H \perp ab$, $U_0(0.1 \mathrm{T}) = (1228.76 \pm 53.64)$ K follows the Arrhenius relation with a power-law field decay ($U_0\propto H^{-\alpha}$). In contrast, under $H \parallel ab$, $U_0(0.5 \mathrm{T}) = (7205.58 \pm 619.65)$ K aligns with the modified TAFF theory, where the scaling exponent $q = 2$ potentially reflects two-dimensional vortex behavior in the TAFF region, and the field dependence of $U_0$ follows parabolic relation $H^{\gamma}\left[1 - \frac{H}{H^{*}}\right]^2$. These results establish 2H-NbS$_2$ as a model system for probing the anisotropy of flux dynamics in layered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin orientation -- a subtle interplay between strain and multipole Coulomb interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</description>

      <title>Low Speed Oblique Impact Behavior On Granular Media Across Gravitational Conditions; The role of cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses of impact provide rich insights from the evolution of granular bodies to their structural properties of the surface and subsurface layers of celestial bodies. Although chemical cohesive bonding has been observed in asteroid samples, and low-speed impact has been a subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of cohesion in these dynamics is limited, especially at small gravities such as those observed on asteroid surfaces. In this work, we use numerical discrete element method (DEM) and analytical dynamic resistive force theory (DRFT) modeling to examine the effect of cohesion on the outcome of the impact into loose granular media and explore scaling laws that predict impact behavior in the presence of cohesion under various gravitational conditions and cohesive strengths. We find that the effect of cohesion on the impact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration, raising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that due to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and friction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM simulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude and Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and inertial forces. Our study suggests that new dimensionless parameters and scaling are required to accurately capture the role of cohesion, given its ties to frictional behavior between the grain particles at different gravities.</description>

      <title>Label free sub-diffraction imaging using non-linear photon avalanche backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging below the limit of light diffraction offers an unprecedented opportunity to study outlook, organization, interactions or in-situ functioning of sub-micrometer, highly transparent objects such as subcellular structures in vitro, thin layers or nano-engineered devices. However, most of current methodologies require to use specially designed luminescent labels, which not only may affect the properties of the sample itself, but often are (photo)toxic, susceptible to photobleaching, offer limited color combinations or specificity of labeling. Moreover, the dedicated fluorescence based super-resolution optical techniques are often technically complex and cumbersome to use. The existing non-destructive, non-invasive and label-free super-resolution imaging (SRI) methods are also challenging, complex and elusive to apply. To address these issues, here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new concept of label-free sub-diffraction optical imaging. The transmission avalanche backlight (TAB) microscopy exploits huge optical non-linearities of photon avalanching materials, which are acting as a virtual near-field nano aperture - a diffraction limited backlight of the actual sample. Such approach enables to augment imaging contrast of highly transparent samples and thin layers, by translating small attenuation and scattering loses occurring on these translucent samples into amplified modulation of luminescence intensity of the avalanche backlighted substrate (ABS). At no additional cost, sub-diffraction imaging is achieved with simple, single beam laser scanning microscopy setup, leading to ca. 70 nm optical resolution. This far-field, label-free, raster scanning imaging technique, with augmented contrast and optical imaging resolution below diffraction limit, may become pivotal for studies in biology, physics, materials science, nanophotonics and nanoengineering</description>

      <title>Enhanced phonon-drag by nanoscale design of homoepitaxial \hbox{$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda&gt;d$.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineered Layer Dependent Nonlinear Optical Response in Two Dimensional Muscovite for Efficient Optical Limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.</description>

      <title>Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of the Frenkel-Kontorova model: Relation to tribological systems and fluid rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Frenkel-Kontorova model is a simple yet generic framework for the description of tribological phenomena and processes, including dry solid friction and the motion of adsorbed layers. As revealed in this work, it also reproduces qualitatively various features of complex liquids, such as, power-law sub-diffusion between the ballistic and the diffusive regimes as well as a cross-over from a non-Arrhenius to an Arrhenius dependence of the diffusion coefficient near the temperature, where the specific heat assumes its maximum. The study of these and related thermal and kinetic properties highlights several misconceptions prevalent in the literature. Most notably, shear thinning with a shear-thinning exponent close to zero can be the natural consequence from enforced basin hopping: the energy drops caused by shear-induced instabilities dictate the friction-velocity dependence at medium shear rates rather than the way how shear forces reduce the free energy barriers for directed motion. Thus, even if the rheology is described by semi-empirical theories such as the Eyring model, any agreement with experimental data, whether past, present, or future, may be purely coincidental.</description>

Abstract: We propose a modular, fast and large-area fabrication of bio-piezoelectric films. The technique is based on the formation of cone-jet mode by applying a high voltage electric field to conductive spiked metal disks. And the self-assembly process of biomolecular materials through nanoconfinement with in-situ poling effect. This job achieved print speeds of up to 9.2 109 um3/s with a combination of only 2 printheads. At the same time, the modular design allows the MLSP to achieve theoretically unlimited print efficiency. It also provides flexible configuration options for different printing needs, such as preparing films of different areas and shapes. In short, MLSP demonstrates the ability of piezoelectric biomaterials to undergo ultra-fast, large-scale assembly. Demonstrates good potential as a universally applicable bio-device for the fabrication of bio-piezoelectric films</description>

      <title>1H Polarization above 60% at room temperature by triplet dynamic nuclear polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1H polarization of 61% was achieved by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) at room temperature and in 0.64 T. We introduced dibenz[a, h]anthracene as a new host molecule of the polarizing agent, pentacene-d14. Its rigid structure provides a long spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of more than 2 hours at room temperature. The single crystal of dibenz[a, h]anthracene doped with 0.05 mol% pentacene-d14 was grown by the Bridgman method, and cut into a small piece of ~1 mg for Triplet-DNP experiment. The 1H polarization buildup and relaxation measurements indicated that paramagnetic relaxation became the major source of the relaxation than spin-lattice relaxation. Finally, two promising applications of room-temperature hyperpolarization, i .e. nuclear ordering and radiation-tolerant polarized target, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal crystal material property prediction via multi-view geometric fusion in graph transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations, however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the origin of long-range ferromagnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by low-energy magnon excitation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance (HF-FMR) study of low-energy magnon excitations in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. At 2 K, the field dependence of the magnon branches is well described by a semiclassical domain-based model, from which we extract key microscopic parameters including the anisotropy gap $\Delta = 170\pm 4$ GHz, the anisotropy field $B_{\rm A} = 5.85\pm 0.08$ T, and the effective $g$-factor $g_{\rm ab}\simeq g_{\rm c} = 2.07(4)$. Furthermore the uniaxial anisotropy constant was determined to be $K = (10.5\pm 0.23) \times 10^{-6}$ erg/cm$^3$. Anisotropic short-range magnetic order persists above $T_{\rm C}$ up to approximately 270 K, as evidenced by a finite anisotropy gap and anisotropic shifts in the FMR resonance fields. Both results clearly show the presence of anisotropic local magnetic fields well above $T_{\rm C}$. Our findings underscore the crucial role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in driving long-range magnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Linearly-polarized few-cycle pulses drive carrier envelope phase-sensitive coherent magnetization injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly-polarized light is well-known to induce, or flip the direction of, magnetization in solids. At its heart, this arises from time-reversal symmetry breaking by the vector potential, causing inverse-Faraday or analogous physical effects. We show here that very short few-cycle pulses can cause similar phenomena even when they are linearly-polarized and off-resonant. We analyze the new effect with ab-initio calculations and demonstrate that it similarly arises due to broken time-reversal symmetry and is carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) sensitive. Coherently tuning the CEP causes the induced magnetism to oscillate from zero to few percent Bohr magneton within few femtoseconds. By changing the laser angle and intensity, the magnetization sign and magnitude can be controlled. Remarkably, due to the nature of the physical mechanism that relies on spin-orbit interactions and orbital currents, the magnetization survives CEP-averaging and the effect should be accessible even in the absence of CEP stabilization. Our work opens new routes for ultrafast coherent tuning and probing of magnetism and circumvents the need for circularly-polarized driving or external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spatial Hole Burning Dynamics in Monolayer WS2: Insights from Time-resolved Photoluminescence Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of excitons lies at the heart of excitonic devices. Probing, understanding, and manipulating excitonic transport represents a critical step prior to their technological applications. In this work, we report experimental studies on the ultrafast nonlinear transport of excitons in monolayer WS2. Under intense optical pumping, we observed an ultrafast spatial hole burning effect in the excitonic emission profile, followed by a re-brightening at even higher pumping density. By means of time- and spatially-resolved photoluminescence imaging spectroscopy, we revealed the underlying mechanism responsible for these nontrivial excitonic diffusion dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the combined effects of ultrafast exciton-exciton annihilation, efficient hole trapping by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, and laser-induced photo-oxidation govern the evolution of exciton transport under strong optical excitation. The observed dynamics are in excellent agreement with our diffusion model simulations, providing new insights into the nonlinear excitonic transport behaviors as well as their optical control mechanism in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Layer-selective Cooper pairing in an alternately stacked transition metal dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigap superconductivity emerges when superconducting gaps form on distinct Fermi surfaces. Arising from locally overlapping atomic orbitals, multiple superconducting bands introduce a new internal degree of freedom in the material that, however, escapes external control due to their coexistence in real space in the known multigap superconductors. Here, we show that the layered superconductor 4Hb-TaSSe - composed of alternating trigonal (H) and octahedral (T) polymorph layers - is a multigap superconductor, featuring two weakly coupled superconducting condensates with distinct properties, spatially separated in alternating layers. Using high-resolution quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy in the two polymorph layers, we identify two superconducting gaps that vary in size and internal structure. The intrinsic Cooper pairing in each polymorph is corroborated by the temperatures and magnetic fields at which the gaps open up, which differ in each polymorph layer and show opposing resilience to these parameters. This behavior enables selective external actuation upon the condensates. Our theoretical model based on ab-initio calculations reproduces key features of the observed superconducting gaps in the presence of finite interlayer hybridization and explains the unusually high critical field observed in the T-layer. Our results establish TMD polymorphs as platforms for engineering tunable multigap superconductors, offering new opportunities in layered superconducting device architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Vortex Dynamics in One-Dimensional TaS2 Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of high-quality 2H-TaS2 nanowires via a controlled two-step conversion process from TaS3 precursors, achieving robust superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc ~ 3.6 K which is significantly higher than bulk 2H-TaS2 (Tc ~ 0.8 K). Structural and compositional analyses confirm phase purity and preserved 1D morphology, while magnetotransport measurements reveal an enhanced upper critical field {\mu}oHc2 (2 K) ~ 5 T, far exceeding the bulk value ({\mu}oHc2 (0) ~ 1.17 T), attributed to dimensional confinement and suppression of charge density wave order. Magnetic characterization demonstrates complex vortex dynamics, including flux jumps and a second magnetization peak, indicative of strong pinning and crossover from elastic to plastic vortex regimes. These findings establish TaS2 nanowires as a versatile platform for studying superconductivity in reduced dimensions and exploiting confinement-driven quantum phenomena for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Optimized Fabrication Procedure for High-Quality Graphene-based Moir\'e Superlattice Devices</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices constitute a versatile platform to investigate emergent phenomena arising from the interplay of strong correlations and topology, while offering flexible in situ tunability. However, the fabrication of such moir\'e superlattices is challenging. It is difficult to achieve highly uniform devices with a precise twist angle because of the unintentional introduction of heterostrain, twist angle disorder, and angle/lattice relaxation during the nanofabrication process. This article introduces an optimized, experience-informed protocol for fabricating high-quality graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices, focusing on a modified dry transfer technique. The transfer process is performed in a highly tunable, custom-built transfer setup that enables precise position, angle, and temperature control. By combining rigorous flake selection criteria, pre-cleaned bubble-free bottom gates, and graphene laser ablation, the moir\'e superlattice is constructed by deliberately overlaying twisted graphene flakes at a submicron speed at room temperature. Through precise control of the transfer process, the resulting graphene moir\'e superlattice devices exhibit high uniformity and desired twist angles. This optimized protocol addresses existing challenges in the fabrication of graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices and paves the way for further advances in the rapidly evolving field of moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Hidden Relaxation Term in Approximate Treatments of Responses to Electric and Magnetic Fields</title>

Abstract: Recently a generalization of the ``\textit{modern theory of orbital magnetization}'' to include non-local Hamiltonians (e.g. hybrid functionals of the generalized Kohn-Sham theory) was provided for magnetic response properties. Results indicated inequivalence between sampling of direct and reciprocal spaces for those calculations far from the complete basis set limit. We show that this can be explained by a hidden ``relaxation'' contribution to the reciprocal-space derivatives. The missing relaxation term is shown to (generally) affect the results of calculations of not only magnetic, but also electric response properties, within the context of the ``\textit{modern theory of polarization}''. Necessary conditions are provided to permit avoiding the calculation of the hidden relaxation term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc., following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron transport combined with magnetism has gained more attention to the spintronics community in the last few decades. Among them, the topological Hall effect (THE), which arises due to the emergent magnetic field of a non-trivial object, is found to be a promising tool for probing the presence of skyrmions. A sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interfacial interaction (iDMI) with reduced effective anisotropy can stabilize skyrmions in thin films. Recently, a large iDMI has been predicted in Pt/Co/Re thin film. Here, we investigate the influence of various magnetic interactions on the THE in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/X (X = Ta, Re) thin films. The presence of skyrmions is confirmed via THE and magnetic force microscope (MFM) imaging. Notably, two distinct types of THE signals are observed in the different samples, which are explained using micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal that exchange interaction, iDMI, effective anisotropy, and saturation magnetization contribute significantly in determining the variations in topological Hall resistivity behavior, which arise from different skyrmionic phases. These findings contribute to the development of novel material systems featuring different skyrmionic phases with potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Here, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers unexplored characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be extended to other Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Role of Ferrons in the Heat Capacity and Thermal Transport of Displacive Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective amplitude mode of the order parameter in displacive ferroelectrics, termed the ferron, represents the amplitude fluctuations of long-range ordered polarization. At temperatures well below phase transition temperature $T_c$, the energy of ferron excitation is significantly gapped in the long-wavelength limit. As $T_c$ is approached, this gap softens dramatically to minimal or gapless values, thereby should lead to a substantial contribution to thermal properties. In this context, we explore the role of ferrons in heat capacity and thermal transport by incorporating a microscopic self-consistent phase-transition theory for displacive ferroelectricity in contrast to the conventional treatment of attributing thermal properties solely to acoustic phonons. Using ferroelectric $\rm{PbTiO}_{3}$ as a case study, we show that the softening of ferrons near the phase transition is essential to accurately capturing the experimental temperature and electric-field dependencies of thermal properties.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</description>

      <title>Global structure searches under varying temperatures and pressures using polynomial machine learning potentials: A case study on silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.</description>

Abstract: Compact direct electron detectors are becoming increasingly popular in electron microscopy applications including electron backscatter diffraction, as they offer an opportunity for low cost and accessible microstructural analysis. In this work, we explore how one of these commercial devices based on the Timepix chip can be optimized to obtain high quality data quickly and easily, through careful systematic analysis of a variety of samples, including: semiconductor silicon, commercially pure nickel, a dual phase titanium-molybdenum alloy, and a silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite. Our findings provide strategies for very fast collection of orientation maps, including at low voltage (5-10 keV) and low beam current conditions. Additionally, strategies for collection of very high quality EBSD patterns are demonstrated that have significant potential for advanced EBSD applications (e.g. elastic strain mapping).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope operated with photon energies in the threshold regime often suffers from low contrast. In this work we show by symmetry considerations, photoemission calculations, and imaging experiments, how the contrast can be improved significantly. The key to both domain selectivity and sizable intensity asymmetries is, guided by symmetry considerations, selecting the momenta of the photoelectrons by a properly positioned contrast aperture. By comparing computational with experimental results for an Fe(001) surface we prove the feasibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely studied for numerous applications and is commercially employed in the semiconductor industry, where planar substrates are the norm. However, the inherent ALD feature of coating virtually any surface geometry with atomistic thickness control is equally attractive for coating particulate materials (supports). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in this decades-old field of ALD on particulate materials, drawing on a bottom-up and quantitative analysis of 799 articles from this field. The obtained dataset is the basis for abstractions regarding reactor types (specifically for particles), coating materials, reactants, supports and processing conditions. Furthermore, the dataset enables direct access to specific processing conditions (for a given material, surface functionality, application etc.) and increases accessibility of the respective literature. We also review fundamental concepts of ALD on particles, and discuss the most common applications, i.e., catalysis (thermo-, electro-, photo-), batteries, luminescent phosphors and healthcare. Finally, we identify historical trends, and provide an outlook on prospective developments.</description>

      <title>Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 12 to 165x faster than r$^2$SCAN10</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Interfacially ordered phase states enable high-strength ductile eutectic Al alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightweight, high-strength structural materials are component enablers in transportation and aerospace, improving carbon footprint and fuel efficiency. Aluminium (Al)-based eutectics have property combinations that qualify them for such applications. However, they are prone to catastrophic failure because of insufficient load transfer across the interfaces between the brittle eutectic phase and the ductile matrix. Here we present a general solution to this problem by engineering these interfaces at the atomic scale, equipping them with excellent load transfer capabilities, thus qualifying such composites for lightweight structural applications. We demonstrate the approach by adding Zr to an Al-Gd-based hypoeutectic alloy, promoting the formation of a coherent Interfacial-Ordered-Phase (IOP) around the brittle Al3Gd eutectic phase and nanosized core-shell ordered precipitates in the primary Al matrix. This enables a 400% increase in tensile plasticity while retaining a high tensile strength of 295 MPa at room temperature and 130 MPa at 250C. This exceptional increase in formability is attributed to the ability of the IOP layer to prevent dislocations from accumulating at the weak fibre/matrix interfaces, avoiding stress concentrations that would otherwise initiate fibre breakage and debonding. The core-shell precipitates in Al cause a large number of dislocation cross/multiple-slips on different {111} planes, forming ultra-fine (10 nm) dislocation networks that leverage substantial plastic strain accumulation. The approach shows how atomic interface design overcomes the ductility limitations of lightweight high-strength ductile eutectic alloys for structural applications.</description>

      <title>Structure determination of flat honeycomb Bi grown on Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Honeycomb bismuthene structures on Ag(111) were investigated using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional theory. LEED I(V) analysis revealed that 0.5 monolayer (ML) of Bi forms an ultraflat honeycomb lattice with negligible buckling at ~120 K, which transforms into other structures upon warming to room temperature. A similar flat bismuthene structure also forms in Mn/Bi/Ag(111), which remains stable even at room temperature. Mn deposition on $(p\times \sqrt{3})$-rect Bi/Ag(111) induces Bi surface segregation, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, resulting in a p$(2\times2)$ honeycomb bismuthene. The detailed structural investigation provides fundamental insights into the characterization of two-dimensional topological properties of bismuthene grown on Ag(111).</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Electronic reconstruction and interface engineering of emergent spin fluctuations in compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ on SrLaAlO$_4$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states around the $\Gamma$ point, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations due to Fermi surface nesting of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states near the interface. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</description>

      <title>Indirect Excitons and Many-body Interactions in InGaAs Double Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Atomic Geometry Representations in Materials Science: A Human-in-the-Loop Multimodal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-induced nonlocal transport in the topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal transport, which goes beyond the Ohm's law, can be a key in understanding systems with topological order or edge states. Here we report an unusual nonlocal charge transport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ that occurs in the ultra-quantum limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the observed decay length of the nonlocality exceeds 100 $\mu$m and it increases linearly with the sample width. This nonlocal transport is detected not only in the longitudinal configuration, but also in the transverse one as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Our findings demonstrate that the nonlocal response can offer unprecedented insights into topological quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io, and the Computer Physics Communications Library. The new version of the code is designed to perform a ground state search for crystal structures with variable compositions by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Herein, we describe the newly implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in the latest version of the code.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Two types of compressible isotropic neo-Hookean material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of vol-iso neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of mixed neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann-Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767-2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: First-Principles Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, $T_c$ increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>
