      <title>Max Bense as a Visionary: from Entropy to the Dialectics of Programmed Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960 in Stuttgart, Max Bense published the book Programming the Beautiful [Programmierung des Sch{\"o}nen]. Bense looks in cybernetics for scientific concepts and instigates the thought of programming in the field of literature. His information aesthetics influences a whole generation of scientists and artists - including the Stuttgart Circle, which takes hold of the new aesthetics to carry out the first programmed artistic images. Is Max Bense a visionary? How is he revolutionizing the world of images? The article discusses the cybernetics that inspired Bense: a science of probability that contrasts with the principles of Newtonian physics. Moreover, in the sixties, Max Bense, together with Elisabeth Walther, launched the experimental magazine Rot, which devoted its pages to the concrete poetry and the first computer-generated images of Georg Nees. As Frieder Nake defends through his pioneering work and theory, these images oppose the visible and the computable. This dialectic opens to a critical thinking on the algorithmic image in art and science.</description>

      <title>Enabling Student Innovation through Virtual Reality Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is clear, from the major press coverage that Virtual Reality (VR) development is garnering, that there is a huge amount of development interest in VR across multiple industries, including video streaming, gaming and simulated learning. Even though PC, web, and mobile are still the top platforms for software development, it is important for university computer science (CS) programs to expose students to VR as a development platform. Additionally, it is important for CS students to learn how to learn about new technologies, since change is constant in the CS field. CS curriculum changes happen much slower than the pace of technology adoption. As new technologies are introduced, CS faculty and students often learn together, especially in smaller CS programs. This paper describes how student-led VR projects are used, across the CS curriculum, as basic CS concepts are covered. The student-led VR projects are engaging, and promote learning and creativity. Additionally, each student project inspires more students to try their hand at VR development as well.</description>
