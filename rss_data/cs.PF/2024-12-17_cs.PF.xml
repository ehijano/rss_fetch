      <title>SnapGen-V: Generating a Five-Second Video within Five Seconds on a Mobile Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</description>

      <title>RWKV-edge: Deeply Compressed RWKV for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deploy LLMs on resource-contained platforms such as mobile robotics and wearables, non-transformers LLMs have achieved major breakthroughs. Recently, a novel RNN-based LLM family, Repentance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) models have shown promising results in text generation on resource-constrained devices thanks to their computational efficiency. However, these models remain too large to be deployed on embedded devices due to their high parameter count. In this paper, we propose an efficient suite of compression techniques, tailored to the RWKV architecture. These techniques include low-rank approximation, sparsity predictors, and clustering head, designed to align with the model size. Our methods compress the RWKV models by 4.95--3.8x with only 2.95pp loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Chopin: An Open Source R-language Tool to Support Spatial Analysis on Parallelizable Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing volume of studies utilize geocomputation methods in large spatial data. There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general scientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing domain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents an R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in geocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin` leverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a computation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data hierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for interoperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes the geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing power in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to high-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental exposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by order of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader research communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process large scale data.</description>

      <title>ASC-Hook: fast and transparent system call hook for Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercepting system calls is crucial for tools that aim to modify or monitor application behavior. However, existing system call interception tools on the ARM platform still suffer from limitations in terms of performance and completeness. This paper presents an efficient and comprehensive binary rewriting framework, ASC-Hook, specifically designed for intercepting system calls on the ARM platform. ASC-Hook addresses two key challenges on the ARM architecture: the misalignment of the target address caused by directly replacing the SVC instruction with br x8, and the return to the original control flow after system call interception. This is achieved through a hybrid replacement strategy and our specially designed trampoline mechanism. By implementing multiple completeness strategies specifically for system calls, we ensured comprehensive and thorough interception. Experimental results show that ASC-Hook reduces overhead to at least 1/29 of that of existing system call interception tools. We conducted extensive performance evaluations of ASC-Hook, and the average performance loss for system call-intensive applications is 3.7\% .</description>
