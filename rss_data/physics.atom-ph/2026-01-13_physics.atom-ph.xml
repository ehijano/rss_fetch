      <title>Creation and precise spectroscopy of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ halo molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the creation of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ molecules in the halo state and neighboring weakly bound states. Efficient molecule production via one-photon photoassociation relies on sufficient wavefunction overlap between the target vibrational states in the electronic excited- and ground-state potentials. Using Autler-Townes spectroscopy, transition strengths are measured to identify optimal pathways for production of weakly bound molecules. Vibrational splittings for the three least-bound vibrational states are measured, and dominant systematic uncertainties are evaluated with uncertainties below 100 Hz. From these splittings, absolute binding energies for these weakly bound vibrational states are determined. The results pave the way to a molecular isotope shift measurement with Sr$_2$.</description>

      <title>Controlling Rydberg atom-polariton interactions: from exceptional points to fast readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.</description>

Abstract: Schiff moments of atomic nuclei are of considerable interest to experiments searching for undiscovered new physics that breaks time-reversal symmetry. I develop a simple picture of the Schiff moment of a charge distribution, and discuss the interaction of the Schiff moment of a nucleus with the field produced by an electron in an atom.</description>

      <title>Endcap-Type Paul Trap for Precision Spectroscopy and Studies of Controlled Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and fabrication of an endcap-type Paul trap. The trap is designed for studies with Ca$^{+}$ and Yb$^{+}$. The design, fabrication process, and characterization are presented in detail with a focus on trapping a single compensated ion at the rf node. A custom-built imaging system of $NA = 0.14$ and magnification $\approx 22 \times$ performs close to diffraction-limit and resolves multi-ion clusters. Controlled ion loading and characterization of the trap are performed using $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$. The experimentally determined quadrupole coefficient of the trap is $\approx 0.3$, which is very close to the design value. The relative frequency shift along the spectroscopy beam due to excess micromotion (EMM) is at the level of $3.5\times 10^{-18}$ for $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$. Applications of this trap encompass single-ion-based optical frequency standards, tests of fundamental physics, the study of mesoscopic Coulomb clusters, and the controlled interaction of a single ion with co-trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum science with arrays of metastable helium-3 atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</description>

      <title>Influence of bending parameters on crystalline undulator radiation peak stability for 530 MeV positron channelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of crystalline undulator radiation (CUR) peaks emitted by 530 MeV positron channelling in periodically bent C(110) crystals with varying bending amplitudes and bending periods. Relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify how these parameters affect the intensity and position of the CUR peak. The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability. MD results show that increasing the bending amplitude shifts the CUR peak to lower photon energies, while decreasing the period shifts it to higher energies, with both trends accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. For crystal parameters similar to recent experiments conducted at the MAinz MIkrotron (MAMI), the simulated CUR peak appears near 0.515 MeV. These results demonstrate that the CUR peak remains stable across a broad range of bending amplitudes and periods, establishing estimates of manufacturing tolerances for the design of gamma-ray crystal-based light sources.</description>

      <title>Excitation spectrum of a bright solitary wave in a Bose-Einstein condensate and its connection with the Higgs and the Goldstone modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms, which are confined in a (quasi) one-dimensional toroidal potential. We focus on the case of an effective attractive interaction between the atoms. The formation of a localized blob (i.e., a ``bright" solitary wave) for sufficiently strong interactions provides an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.</description>

      <title>Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: A Time-Domain Generalization of Extended Koopmans' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $\omega-2\omega$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice (FSL) of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the FSL, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the FSL, we introduce a physically motivated and directly measurable topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is related to the invariant. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected spin states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>

      <title>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stress, or pressure, is a central quantity in engineering and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is invalid for an inhomogeneous fluid, which is essential in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area, yet is derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress1 to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing the incorporation of quantum mechanical (QM) physics into classical simulation. We present the derivation of this local stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving and Kirkwood 2 . For the test case of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show that the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate that this planar definition of stress is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP, is provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, rather than the interparticle interactions, can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.</description>
