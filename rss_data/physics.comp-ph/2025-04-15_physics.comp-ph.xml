      <title>Optimizing excited states in quantum Monte Carlo: A reassessment of double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven to be highly accurate for computing excited states, but the choice of optimization strategies for multiple states remains an active topic of investigation. In this work, we revisit the calculation of double excitation energies in nitroxyl, glyoxal, tetrazine, and cyclopentadienone, exploring different objective functionals and their impact on the accuracy and robustness of QMC. A previous study for these systems employed a penalty functional to enforce orthogonality among the states, but the chosen prefactors did not strictly ensure convergence to the target states. Here, we confirm the reliability of previous results by comparing excitation energies obtained with different functionals and analyzing their consistency. Additionally, we investigate the performance of different functionals when starting from a pre-collapsed excited state, providing insight into their ability to recover the target wave functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified, human-readable, machine-processable novel syntax/notation designed to comprehensively describe reactions, molecules and excitation states. Our notation resolves inconsistencies in existing data representations and facilitates seamless integration with computational tools.

      <title>Non-intrusive Auto-detecting and Adaptive Hybrid Scheme for Multiscale Heat Transfer: Thermal Runaway in a Battery Pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing and simulating multiscale systems is a formidable challenge, as both spatial and temporal scales can span many orders of magnitude. Rigorous upscaling methods not only ensure efficient computation, but also maintains errors within a priori prescribed limits. This provides a balance between computational costs and accuracy. However, the most significant difficulties arise when the conditions under which upscaled models can be applied cease to hold. To address this, we develop an automatic-detecting and adaptive, nonintrusive two-sided hybrid method for multiscale heat transfer and apply it to thermal runaway in a battery pack. To allow adaptive hybrid simulations, two kernels are developed to dynamically map the values between the fine-scale and the upscaled subdomains in a single simulation. The accuracy of the developed hybrid method is demonstrated through conducting a series of thermal runaway test cases in a battery pack. Our results show that the maximum spatial errors consistently remain below the threshold bounded by upscaling errors.</description>

      <title>Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards scientific machine learning for granular material simulations -- challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-scale mechanisms, such as inter-particle and particle-fluid interactions, govern the behaviour of granular systems. While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges.
  This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models.
  We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.</description>

      <title>A Robust Lattice Boltzmann Method for Interface-Bound Transport of a Passive Scalar: Application to Surfactant-Laden Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of a passive scalar restricted on interfaces, which is advected by the fluid motions have numerous applications in multiphase transport phenomena. A prototypical example is the advection-diffusion of the concentration field of an insoluble surfactant along interfaces. A sharp-interface model of the surfactant transport on the interface (Stone, Phys. Fluids A, 1990) has been extended to a diffuse-interface formulation based on a delta-function regularization by Teigen et al. (in Comm. Math. Sci., 2009). However, the latter approach involves singular terms which can compromise its numerical implementation. Recently, Jain and Mani (in Annual Research Briefs, CTR, Stanford University, 2022) circumvented this issue by applying a variable transformation, which effectively leads to a generalized interface-bound scalar transport equation with an additional interfacial confining flux term. The resulting formulation has similarities with the conservative Allen-Cahn equation (CACE) used for tracking of interfaces. In this paper, we will discuss a novel robust central moment lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate the interface-bound advection-diffusion transport equation of a scalar field proposed in Teigen et al. by applying Jain and Mani's transformation. It is coupled with another LB scheme for the CACE to compute the evolving interfaces, and the resulting algorithm is validated against some benchmark problems available in the literature. As further extension, we have coupled it with our central moment LB flow solver for the two-fluid motions, which is modulated by the Marangoni stresses resulting from the variation of the surface tension with the local surfactant concentration modeled via the Langmuir isotherm. This is then validated by simulating insoluble surfactant-laden drop deformation and break-up in a shear flow at various capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Model Based Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method for Effective Simulations of Thermal Convective Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation represents the drift-diffusive processes in kinetic models. It can also be regarded as a model for the collision integral of the Boltzmann-type equation to represent thermo-hydrodynamic processes in fluids. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a drastically simplified discretization of the Boltzmann equation. We construct two new FP-based LBMs, one for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations and the other for simulating the energy equation, where, in each case, the effect of collisions is represented as relaxations of different central moments to their respective attractors. Such attractors are obtained by matching the changes in various discrete central moments under collision with the continuous central moments prescribed by the FP model. As such, the resulting central moment attractors depend on the lower order moments and the diffusion tensor parameters and significantly differ from those based on the Maxwell distribution. The diffusion tensor parameters for evolving higher moments in simulating fluid motions at relatively low viscosities are chosen based on a renormalization principle. The use of such central moment formulations in modeling the collision step offers significant improvements in numerical stability, especially for simulations of thermal convective flows with a wide range of variations in the transport coefficients. We develop new FP central moment LBMs for thermo-hydrodynamics in both two- and three-dimensions and demonstrate the ability of our approach to accurately simulate various cases involving thermal convective buoyancy-driven flows, especially at high Rayleigh numbers. Moreover, we show significant improvements in numerical stability of our FP central moment LBMs when compared to other existing central moment LBMs using the Maxwell distribution in achieving higher Peclet numbers for mixed convection flows.</description>

      <title>Luttinger compensated magnetic material LaMn2SbO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and Luttinger compensated magnetism,
  characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin
  splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied,
  research on Luttinger compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, Luttinger com pensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized
  experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic struc ture calculations, we predict that LaMn2SbO6 is a Luttinger compensated magnetic semiconductor.
  Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin
  splitting in LaMn2SbO6 is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn2SbO6 has already been synthesized
  experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments.
  Therefore, LaMn2SbO6 serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical
  properties of Luttinger compensated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Impact of network assortativity on disease lifetime in the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accurately represent disease spread, epidemiological models must account for the complex network topology and contact heterogeneity. Traditionally, most studies have used random heterogeneous networks, which ignore correlations between the nodes' degrees. Yet, many real-world networks exhibit degree assortativity - the tendency for nodes with similar degrees to connect. Here we explore the effect degree assortativity (or disassortativity) has on long-term dynamics and disease extinction in the realm of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on heterogeneous networks. We derive analytical results for the mean time to extinction (MTE) in assortative networks with weak heterogeneity, and show that increased assortativity reduces the MTE and that assortativity and degree heterogeneity are interchangeable with regard to their impact on the MTE. Our analytical results are verified using the weighted ensemble numerical method, on both synthetic and real-world networks. Notably, this method allows us to go beyond the capabilities of traditional numerical tools, enabling us to study rare events in large assortative networks, which were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven model order reduction of a fluid-kinetic spectral solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations are computationally intensive due to six-dimensional phase space discretization. Many kinetic spectral solvers use the asymmetrically weighted Hermite expansion due to its conservation and fluid-kinetic coupling properties, i.e., the lower-order Hermite moments capture and describe the macroscopic fluid dynamics and higher-order Hermite moments describe the microscopic kinetic dynamics. We leverage this structure by developing a parametric data-driven reduced-order model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition, which projects the higher-order kinetic moments while retaining the fluid moments intact. This approach can also be understood as learning a nonlocal closure via a reduced modal decomposition. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the method ensures local and global mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The numerical results show that the proposed method effectively replicates the high-dimensional spectral simulations at a fraction of the computational cost and memory, as validated on the weak Landau damping and two-stream instability benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>SEMPO - Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer - SEMPO - is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Existence of Nonequilibrium Glasses in the Degenerate Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground-State Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 &lt; \chi &lt;1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via nuclear fusion. One common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from developing turbulence. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we leverage two different approaches to build such fields: for the first approach, we use an analytical derivation of the dispersion relation of the VP system to find a range of reasonable fields that can potentially suppress instability, providing a qualitative suggestion. For the second approach, we leverage PDE-constrained optimization to obtain a locally optimal field using different loss functions. As the stability of the system can be characterized in several different ways, the objective functions need to be tailored accordingly. We show, through extensive numerical tests, that objective functions such as the relative entropy (KL divergence) and the $L^{2}$ norm result in a highly non-convex problem, rendering the global minimum difficult to find. However, we show that using the electric energy of the system as a loss function is advantageous, as it has a large convex basin close to the global minimum. Unfortunately, outside the basin, the electric energy landscape consists of unphysical flat local minima, thus rendering a good initial guess key for the overall convergence of the optimization problem, particularly for solvers with adaptive steps.</description>

Abstract: Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>

Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>DISPATCH methods: an approximate, entropy-based Riemann solver for ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advance of supercomputers we can now afford simulations with very large ranges of scales. In astrophysical applications, e.g. simulating Solar, stellar and planetary atmospheres, interstellar medium, etc; physical quantities, like gas pressure, density, temperature, plasma $\beta$, Mach, Reynolds numbers can vary by orders of magnitude. This requires a robust solver, which can deal with a very wide range of conditions and be able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium where it is applicable. We reformulate a Godunov-type HLLD Riemann solver that it would be suitable to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium in atmospheric applications in a range of Mach numbers, regimes where kinetic and magnetic energies dominate over thermal energy without any ad-hoc corrections. We change the solver to use entropy instead of total energy as the primary thermodynamic variable in the system of MHD equations. The entropy is not conserved, it increases when kinetic and magnetic energy is converted to heat, as it should. We propose using an approximate entropy - based Riemann solver as an alternative to already widely used Riemann solver formulations where it might be beneficial. We conduct a series of standard tests with varying conditions and show that the new formulation for the Godunov type Riemann solver works and is promising.</description>

      <title>3D Anderson localization of light in disordered systems of dielectric particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of full-wave numerical simulations of light transmission through layers of irregular dielectric particles, demonstrating three-dimensional Anderson localization of light in disordered, uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer suppresses the transverse spreading of a propagating beam. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential temporal dependence is observed in short-pulse time-resolved transmission measurements as the system approaches the Ioffe-Regel condition. Along with this, the transmission spectrum becomes consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction of scatterers and the refractive index contrast enhances the non-exponential behavior induced by disorder, which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

Abstract: Classification is a central task in deep learning algorithms. Usually, images are first captured and then processed by a sequence of operations, of which the artificial neuron represents one of the fundamental units. This paradigm requires significant resources that scale (at least) linearly in the image resolution, both in terms of photons and computational operations. Here, we present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. It classifies objects without reconstructing their images, using the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical artificial neuron.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Variational Inference for Physics-Informed Deep Generative Modelling</title>

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a computationally efficient and scalable methodology for approximate Bayesian inference. It strikes a balance between accuracy of uncertainty quantification and practical tractability. It excels at generative modelling and inversion tasks due to its built-in Bayesian regularisation and flexibility, essential qualities for physics related problems. For such problems, the underlying physical model determines the dependence between variables of interest, which in turn will require a tailored derivation for the central VI learning objective. Furthermore, in many physical inference applications this structure has rich meaning and is essential for accurately capturing the dynamics of interest. In this paper, we provide an accessible and thorough technical introduction to VI for forward and inverse problems, guiding the reader through standard derivations of the VI framework and how it can best be realized through deep learning. We then review and unify recent literature exemplifying the flexibility allowed by VI. This paper is designed for a general scientific audience looking to solve physics-based problems with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification</description>

      <title>Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables the use of physics-informed device topologies in inverse design and maintains compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>
