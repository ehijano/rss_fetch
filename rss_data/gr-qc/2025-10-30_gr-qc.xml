      <title>Accelerating behavior from dynamical system analysis parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed the dynamical system analysis to obtain the critical point in which, the value of the geometric and dynamical parameters satisfy the late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe. At the outset, the modified Friedmann equations have been reformulated into a system of coupled differential equations to ensure that the minimal set of equations required for a second-order $f(Q)$ gravity. Then these equations are solved numerically to constrain the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and high-precision Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia Supernovae datasets are used to constrain the parameters. The evolution of key cosmological parameters indicates that the model exhibits quintessence-like behavior at present, with a tendency to converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM model at late-times. The dynamic system analysis provided the critical points that correspond to different phases of the Universe, which are analyzed in detail. The existence of a stable de Sitter attractor confirms the accelerating behavior of the model.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Bragg Law: Interpreting the CMB as a Diffractogram of Foliated Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Ringermacher and Mead has revealed discrete oscillations in the cosmological scale factor, suggesting that spacetime may exhibit vibrational properties akin to those of a crystal. Building on this idea, we propose a novel geometric interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB angular power spectrum by treating it as an inverted X-ray diffractogram of early spacetime. In this framework,the acoustic peaks correspond to constructive interference from a stratified, resonant structure of the universe at the time of recombination. We formulate a cosmological analogue of Bragg law, linking angular multipoles to acoustic shell spacing and comoving distance. This model predicts the positions of the first four acoustic peaks observed by the Planck satellite with remarkable accuracy.A global correction factor of near 0.9 needed to align predictions with observations, may reflect the influence of geometric torsion as described in EinsteinCartan theory. While not a replacement for full radiative transfer modeling,this approach offers a complementary geometric framework for understanding the harmonic structure of the CMB and the possible crystalline nature of primordial spacetime.</description>

      <title>Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit, we find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Midisuperspacetime foam and the cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard quantum field theory arguments predict an enormous cosmological constant. But what would this mean observationally? For a homogeneous universe the answer is clear, but if the universe is inhomogeneous at the Planck scale, the question becomes more subtle: for a large class of initial data, rapidly expanding and contracting regions coexist and give an average expansion near zero. Classically, such data develop singularities, and we need a quantum description of their evolution. I describe results from a spherically symmetric midisuperspace model, in which the wave function can become trapped for long periods in regions in which the average expansion remains small, effectively hiding a large cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide constraints for future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>BOB the (Waveform) Builder: Optimizing Analytical Black-Hole Binary Merger Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model provides a fully analytical and physically motivated description of the merger-ringdown gravitational radiation emanating from a black hole binary merger. We perform a comprehensive validation of BOB for the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of quasi-circular and non-precessing systems, assessing its accuracy against numerical relativity (NR) simulations, state-of-the-art waveform models, and a sum of quasinormal modes. We demonstrate that BOB most accurately describes the gravitational wave news, achieving accuracy comparable to highly-calibrated Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate models. Because BOB is minimally tuned to NR catalogs, it retains a high level of accuracy in regions of the parameter space sparsely covered by current NR catalogs. BOB yields an analytic link between the amplitude of the fundamental quasinormal mode and the peak amplitude of the News, which we verify to within the errors of a surrogate ringdown model. We identify a flavor of BOB that requires only the remnant mass and spin, yet matches the accuracy of models that fit a sum of many overtones. Lastly, we show that BOB accurately models both the mass and current quadrupole waves for superkick configurations, contrary to a claim in the literature, and explain why that study was not actually implementing BOB as it has been defined. Our findings establish BOB as a powerful tool for gravitational wave analysis, for providing independent tests of NR-calibrated models, and for better understanding the underlying physics of the merger. We provide a companion python package, gwBOB, allowing for the easy construction of various flavors of BOB and comparison to NR waveforms.</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes with Spaceborne Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) holds crucial clues to their origins. For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework to assess the detectability and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors, while accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers eccentric SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution, dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect the SGWBs from both isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and 170. However, these backgrounds are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly eccentric SBBHs formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and sharp decline. While this feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a clear distinction from the strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Highly damped Quasi-Normal Modes of a Loop Quantum Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute asymptotic Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies -- i.e. frequencies with a very large Imaginary part -- of a Loop Quantum Gravity inspired Black Hole. The deformations from the Schwarzschild Black Hole are encoded via two parameters: the minimal area gap $a_0$ and the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. In this study, we focus on the effect of the latter one, $P$, on the highly-damped part of QNM spectra. We consider both spin 0 and spin 2 test-field perturbations on the Black Hole as proper gravitational perturbations cannot be performed on an effective model. We use an analytical method of computation of QNMs referred to as the monodromy technique, which allows us to compute the asymptotic behaviour of QNMs. We found interesting oscillating behaviour in both the Real part and the Imaginary part of the QNMs, where the oscillation period varies with the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. We compare these analytical predictions to numerical results obtained thanks to the Continued fraction method. Even though the latter does not converge for QNMs with a very large Imaginary part, the numerical results are in rather good agreement with the monodromy prediction.</description>

      <title>Gauge Boundary conditions to mitigate CoM drift in BBH simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Observational appearance and additional photon rings of the asymmetric thin-shell wormhole in the Kalb-Ramond background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the ray-tracing method to conduct an in-depth study of the observational images of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the Kalb-Ramond field. Initially, we calculate the null geodesics and effective potential energy of ATSW, and investigate the variations in the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter l. Based on these calculations, we determine the photon deflection angles and trajectories within this space-time structure. Specifically, depending on the photon impact parameters, the photon trajectories can be categorized into three types. By using a thin accretion disk as the sole background light source and incorporating two classical observational radiation models, we find that under conditions of equal mass M, charge quantity Q, and Lorentz-violation parameter l, the asymmetric thin-shell wormhole exhibits unique observational features such as additional lensing rings and photon ring clusters. Furthermore, distinct from black holes, as the charge quantity Q and the Lorentz-violation parameter l increase, the coverage area of the specific additional halo also expands correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Critical Collapse of a Yang-Mills Field With Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to the Einstein equations near the threshold of black hole formation exhibit remarkable behavior known as critical phenomena gravitational collapse. In this work we perform characteristic evolution in compactified Bondi coordinates in order to study the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills field, allowing for the extraction of global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function. Our numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we demonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits local DSS behavior, characterized by an echoing period of~$\Delta \simeq 0.7388$, agreeing with previous works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We furthermore show that the mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold evolutions scales as a function of the distance to the critical parameter, with a critical exponent of approximately~$\gamma=0.1977\pm0.0009$. Finally, our findings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Parameter matching between horizon quasi-local and point-particle definitions at 1PN for quasi-circular and non spinning BBH systems in harmonic gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN) theory compare with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole (BBH) systems. In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although these definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ by finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each companion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory -- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that preserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the apparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the leading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle) parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon penetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the PN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework provides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be extended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating Astrometric and Timing Residuals to Constrain Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cross-correlation between astrometric and timing-residual observables for distant sources, such as pulsars and galaxies, and equivalent observables for nearby solar system bodies. Using the unified spin-weighted formalism introduced in [1], we derive the angular correlation functions-generalised Hellings-Downs curves-that describe the response of these mixed observables to a stochastic, unpolarised gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity for such measurements, focusing on cross-correlations between pulsar timing array (PTA) redshift signals and astrometric or distortion (shimmering) effects induced in solar system objects such as asteroids. Although the current astrometric precision of asteroid tracking does not yet provide competitive constraints relative to PTA-only surveys, the method offers a complementary probe with enhanced sensitivity at higher frequencies. Future wide-field surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB. A key advantage of the technique is its reduced susceptibility to correlated systematics across different measurement domains, providing an independent cross-check of PTA detections and a potential observational bridge between PTA and LISA frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</description>

      <title>Torque cancellation effect of Intensity noise for Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chart of nuclei could be enlarged with a branch describing neutron stars that are huge nuclei of a few solar masses held together by
  gravity force and sustained by the pressure due to the degenerate Fermi sea. We contend in this manuscript that yet another branch
  could be added: objects with a large weak charge, with masses around $10^{-3}$ solar masses and having radii of a few meters, very compact,
  only slightly larger than their Schwarzchild radius, and sustained by the pressure generated by the weak force due to $Z$ exchange.
  This interaction, insignificant in normal neutron stars, could become dominant when ultrahigh densities are reached due to the action of gravity
  and lead to stable configurations if the appropriate conditions are met. They would constitute a physical realization of the equation of state
  proposed by Zeldovich some decades ago.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the literature on locality on de Sitter with the goal to organize the main results with respect to the representation theory of the isometry group of four dimensional de Sitter. We make use of the late-time behavior of two-point functions of principal and discrete series representation, both in physical and in field space and compare the role of the zero modes. Our overall conclusion is that when it comes to locality on de Sitter, analyzed in terms of cluster decomposition, the principal series representation that capture matter fields and discrete series representations that capture gauge fields show different behavior. Focusing on scalars as a first analysis, matter fields show explicit signs of respecting cluster decomposition while gauge fields do not.</description>

      <title>Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity in 3D: Thermodynamics of cosmological solutions and black holes with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized sets of asymptotic conditions for both three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity and a novel extension that incorporates torsion through a deformation of the Maxwell algebra. These boundary conditions include the most general temporal components of the gauge fields that consistently preserve the corresponding asymptotic Maxwell algebras with identical classical central charges, while allowing for the inclusion of chemical potentials conjugate to the conserved charges. We show that both sets of asymptotic configurations admit nontrivial solutions carrying not only mass and angular momentum but also an additional global spin-2 charge. In the torsionless case, the theory admits locally flat cosmological spacetimes, whereas in the presence of torsion, it generalizes to BTZ-like black hole geometries. For each case, the thermodynamic properties are consistently derived in terms of the gauge fields and the topology of the Euclidean manifold, shown to correspond to a solid torus. Furthermore, we obtain a general expression for the entropy, depending on both the horizon area and its spin-2 analogues, which can be written as a reparametrization-invariant integral of the induced spin-2 fields on the spacelike section of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Morphological Zoo of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Conformal Blocks in 2d Carrollian/Galilean CFTs and Excited State Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the study of flat space holography by computing the entanglement entropy of highly excited states in two-dimensional Carrollian/Galilean Conformal Field Theories (C/G CFTs). Our approach is centered on a novel, physically intuitive derivation of the heavy-light conformal block in the large central charge limit, where the backreaction of heavy operators is absorbed by a C/G conformal coordinate transformation. Using this result and the replica trick, we find that the entanglement entropy of highly excited states assumes a thermal form, providing a concrete realization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). This field-theoretic result perfectly reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy computed via the swing surface proposal in three-dimensional Einstein gravity, for backgrounds corresponding to spinning particles and Flat Space Cosmological solutions. This agreement establishes a precise dictionary relating the weight $\Delta$ and charge $\xi$ of the boundary state to the mass $m$ and angular momentum $j$ of the dual spacetime, offering a powerful consistency check for the Flat/CCFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

      <title>A new conformal gauge theory of vector-spinors and spin-3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique off-shell fermionic gauge invariance of a vector-spinor field theory is found, and the invariant action is derived. The latter is Weyl invariant in any dimension in the massless limit, and it coincides with the singular point of the one-parameter family of Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangians. Pure gauge configurations are represented by gamma-trace vector-spinors, which can be gauged away in a global way. Previous claims that this theory is inconsistent are shown to be flawed, and the Velo-Zwanziger instability is proved to be absent. The theory propagates a massive spin-3/2 particle together with a spin-1/2 state whose mass is twice that of the j=3/2 mode. This physical prediction is derived in a consistent fashion both from the classical field equations in d=4 and from the causal construction of a gamma-traceless quantum vector-spinor field. The conformal anomaly is derived using known results for the heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators, and it is shown that the a-anomaly has an opposite sign w.r.t. known results for lower spin fields.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Quantum-Corrected Black Holes with String Clouds: A Multi-Observable Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes coupled with clouds of strings, examining two distinct theoretical models that incorporate quantum gravitational effects through different implementations of correction terms. Our study explores the geodesic structure, focusing on photon sphere properties, black hole shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits of test particles around these exotic geometries. The analysis reveals fundamental modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We will analyze through a first order perturbative formulation the local loss of symmetry when a source of electromagnetic and gravitational field interacts with an agent that perturbs the original geometry associated to the source. As the local gauge symmetry in Abelian or even non-Abelian field structures in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes is displayed through the existence of local planes of symmetry that we will refer to as blades one and two, the loss of symmetry will be manifested by the tilting of these planes under the influence of an external agent. In this strict sense the original local symmetry will be lost. We will be able to prove in this way that the new blades at the same point will correspond ''after the tilting generated by perturbation" to a new symmetry. The purpose of this paper is to show that the geometrical manifestation of local gauge symmetries is dynamic. Despite the fact that the local original symmetries will be lost, new symmetries will arise. A dynamic evolution of local symmetries will be evidenced. This result will produce a new theorem on dynamic symmetry evolution.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation reaction and energy extraction from black holes: The tail term cannot be ignored</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction in curved space and the dynamics of radiating charged particles. The equation of motion for such particles is the DeWitt-Brehme equation, and it contains a particularly complicated, non-local, tail term. It has been claimed that the tail term can be neglected in certain magnetized black hole spacetimes, and that radiation reaction may then lead to energy extraction ("orbital widening") in the absence of an ergoregion. We show that such claims are incorrect, at least in the Newtonian limit: the tail term can never be neglected consistently in the relevant scenarios, and when it is included the reported energy extraction no longer occurs. Thus, previous results are called into question by our work.</description>

Motivated by the attention on the Kalb-Ramond field as a dark matter candidate, in this work, we study a parity violating dimension four operator which couples the dual Riemann curvature to the 2-form field. After mapping the equations of motion for the right- and left-handed gravitational wave amplitudes to the novel parameterization presented in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk}, we discuss constraints on the model parameters in light of the coincident electromagnetic/gravitational wave signal of GW170817.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help identify the host galaxy. Since GWs directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help with the study of cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting the EM emissions is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformability of neutron stars (NSs), combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. While several studies have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using dark BNSs (without EM counterparts), none have consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. We demonstrate the statistical robustness of our method using $50$ simulated BNS events following Gaussian and double Gaussian mass distributions, detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O5 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 35\%$ ($90\%$ credible interval). This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information. We also report the Hubble constant measurements obtained from a more realistic set of $5$ simulated BNS events.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk around Schwarzschild-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08424v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical properties and optical appearance of a thin accretion disk surrounding a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) are investigated within the framework of bumblebee gravity. To understand how the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $l$ affects the disk's behavior, we analyze main characteristics such as energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. In addition, direct and secondary images of the accretion disk are generated and examined to explore how both the observational inclination angle and the LSB parameter $l$ shape the visual profile. Furthermore, we compute the redshift and observed flux distributions of the disk from the perspective of distant observers at various inclination angles. Our results indicate that the redshift factor grows as $l$ decreases. When the parameter $l$ assumes negative values, the BH exhibits enhanced luminosity with decreasing $l$. These findings highlight the crucial influence of the LSB parameter $l$ on the observable features of BHs.</description>

      <title>Instability and Information Production Around Kerr Black Holes: Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit exponentially unstable motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. This exponentially unstable motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including th non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. For massive particles plunging into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge-theoretical method introduced in our previous paper is applied to solve the axisymmetric and static Einstein-Maxwell equations. We obtain the solutions of the non-Weyl class, where the gravitational and electric or magnetic potentials are not functionally related. In the electrostatic case, we show that the obtained solution coincides with the solution given by Bonnor in 1979. In the magnetostatic case, we present a solution describing the gravitational field created by two magnetically charged masses. In this solution, we present a case in which the Dirac string does not stretch to spatial infinity but lies between the magnetically charged masses.</description>

      <title>Strong-gravity precession resonances for binary systems orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length, which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the no-boundary proposal.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Systematic Biases in Black Hole Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How long after the merger of two black holes can one rely on linear perturbation theory, and how many quasinormal modes are in the ringdown? Such questions suggest that black hole spectroscopy suffers from systematic uncertainties that potentially spoil ringdown analyses, both from high-accuracy simulations and in data from gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying biases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too expensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches. We quantify the validity of the Fisher information matrix and bias formula by comparing it to robust but slow Bayesian sampling. Working with flat noise in the time domain, statistical errors and systematic biases can mostly be detected analytically. Due to its efficiency, we provide detailed parameter space analyses for potentially unmodeled small contributions from overtones, quadratic modes, and tails. We find linear signal analysis well suited for predicting biases in simple ringdown models at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of order 50 when unmodeled effects are small. It is also valuable in explaining ongoing issues in extracting quasinormal modes from high-precision simulations, as one can understand them as high-SNR signals. Therefore, this approach offers promising prospects for improving ringdown models by efficiently identifying and incorporating systematic uncertainties, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and robustness of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing, in particular the shadow and photon rings, in the Ernst spacetime, also known as the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime, which describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a homogenous magnetic field. Although the geodesic equation in this spacetime is chaotic, there are some relevant features that can be determined analytically. Among other things, we give analytic formulas for the vertical diameter of the shadow for an observer at arbitrary inclination and for the horizontal diameter of the shadow for an observer in the equatorial plane. Moreover, we use the strong-deflection formalism for analytically calculating the so-called photon rings of order $\ge 2$ and we use the recently introduced gap parameter $\Delta _2$ for distinguishing lensing of an Ernst black hole from that of a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Viability Constraints on Baryogenesis in f (R, Lm, T) Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study explores gravitational baryogenesis in the context of f(R, Lm, T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar, Lm represents the Lagrangian density of the matter field, and T stands for the metric contraction of T_{mu nu}. We focus on a linear model: f(R, Lm, T) = alpha R + beta Lm + gamma T, and examine the parameter constraints for a successful baryon asymmetry generation in four different eras of the cosmos under the assumption of a power-law cosmic expansion. The computed baryon-to-entropy ratio is found to be consistent with the observed order of asymmetry ratio, 9.42 x 10^-11. Furthermore, the study is extended to the generalized framework of gravitational baryogenesis, where the outcome shows strong agreement with the current observational data. Our findings indicate that the f(R, Lm, T) framework provides a compatible theoretical foundation for producing the observed matter imbalance of the cosmos, thereby emphasizing its potential significance in early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational quasinormal modes of the Dymnikova black hole, a regular spacetime in which the central singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. This geometry, originally proposed as a phenomenological model, also arises naturally in the framework of Asymptotically Safe gravity, where quantum corrections lead to a scale-dependent modification of the Schwarzschild solution. Focusing on axial gravitational perturbations, we compute the dominant quasinormal frequencies using the WKB method with Pad\'e approximants and verify the results with time-domain integration. We find that the introduction of the quantum parameter $l_{\rm cr}$ leads to systematic deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum: the real oscillation frequency decreases as $l_{\rm cr}$ increases, while the damping rate also becomes smaller, implying longer-lived modes. In the limit of large $l_{\rm cr}$, the quasinormal spectrum smoothly approaches the Schwarzschild case. These results suggest that even though the corrections are localized near the horizon, they leave imprints in the gravitational-wave ringdown which may become accessible to observation with future high-precision detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</description>

Abstract: An introductory, self-contained overview, with pedagogical figures, is provided to acquaint readers unfamiliar with the subjects with key aspects of de Sitter space and inflation. The connection between de Sitter space and cosmology is reviewed. The embedding of a hyperboloid surface in higher-dimensional Minkowski space is analysed, and the Killing vectors of de Sitter space are derived in both global and planar coordinate systems; their integral curves are visualised on the de Sitter Penrose diagram, illustrating the static patch and cosmological horizon. The inflaton scalar field is quantised in the Bunch-Davies vacuum within the slow-roll regime. The two- and three-point correlation functions are computed using the ADM decomposition and the in-in formalism. These computations are related to the observed small temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify low-acceleration conditions under which the Unruh effect manifests as an early superradiant burst in a collection of excited atoms. The resulting amplified Unruh signal is resolved from the inertial signal both in time and intensity. We demonstrate theoretically that these conditions are realized inside a sub-resonant cavity that highly suppresses the response of an inertial atom, while allowing significant response from an accelerated atom as, owing to the acceleration-induced spectral broadening, it can still couple to the available field modes. The setup thus selectively amplifies the modified field fluctuations underlying the Unruh effect into an early superradiant burst. In comparison, the field fluctuations perceived inertially would cause a superradiant burst much later. In this way, we simultaneously address the extreme acceleration requirement, the weak Unruh signal, and the dominance of the inertial signal, all within a single experimental arrangement.</description>

Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $Z_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Asymmetry in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the question of which collections of general relativistic spacetimes are deterministic relative to which definitions. We begin by considering a series of three definitions of increasing strength due to Belot (1995). The strongest of these definitions is particularly interesting for spacetime theories because it involves an asymmetry condition called ``rigidity'' that has been studied previously in a different context (Geroch 1969; Halvorson and Manchak 2022; Dewar 2024). We go on to explore other (stronger) asymmetry conditions that give rise to other (stronger) forms of determinism. We introduce a number of definitions of this type and clarify the relationships between them and the three considered by Belot. We go on to show that there are collections of general relativistic spacetimes that satisfy much stronger forms of determinism than previously known. We also highlight a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <title>Stable non-linear evolution in regularised higher derivative effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of a recently proposed regularisation scheme to formulate the initial value problem for general (relativistic) effective field theories (EFTs) with arbitrary higher order equations of motion. We consider a simple UV theory that describes a massive and a massless scalar degree of freedom. Integrating out the heavy field gives rise to an EFT for the massless scalar. By adding suitable regularising terms to the EFT truncated at the level of dimension-$4$ and dimension-$6$ operators, we show that the resulting regularised theories admit a well-posed initial value problem. The regularised theories are related by a field redefinition to the original truncated EFTs and they propagate massive ghost fields (whose masses can be chosen to be of the order of the UV mass scale), in addition to the light field. We numerically solve the equations of motion of the UV theory and those of the regularised EFTs in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space for various choices of initial data and UV mass parameter. When derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently small compared to the UV mass scale, the regularised EFTs exhibit stable evolution in the computational domain and provide very accurate approximations of the UV theory. On the other hand, when the initial gradients of the light field are comparable to the UV mass scale, the effective field theory description breaks down and the corresponding regularised EFTs exhibit ghost-like/tachyonic instabilities. Finally, we also formulate a conjecture on the global nonlinear stability of the vacuum in the regularised scalar EFTs in $3+1$ dimensions. These results suggest that the regularisation approach provides a consistent classical description of the UV theory in a regime where effective field theory is applicable.</description>

      <title>Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering at 5PM order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, i.e. at four loops. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. By relating the geometries of integrals across different loop orders and integral families, we find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail. By further computing their leading singularities using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we show that there only appear two different three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries and two different K3 surfaces at this loop order, which together characterize the space of functions beyond polylogarithms to which the 5PM integrals evaluate.</description>

      <title>Covariant Energy Density Functionals for Neutron Star Matter Equation of State Modeling: Cross-Comparison Analysis Using \texttt{CompactObject}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes and contrasts different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the \texttt{CompactObject} package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution valid in realistic astrophysical environment), we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. The induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.</description>

      <title>Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar-System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), making explicit the bridge from cosmology-level linear responses to local, screened residuals. In scalar-tensor frameworks with a universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$ and chameleon/Vainshtein screening, we map cosmological responses $\{\mu(z,k),\Sigma(z,k)\}$ inferred by DESI and \emph{Euclid} to thin-shell or Vainshtein residuals in deep Solar potentials $\Phi_N$. We emphasize a two-branch strategy. In a detection-first branch, a verified local anomaly -- an Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) violation, a Shapiro-delay signal with $|\gamma-1|\sim\mathrm{few}\times 10^{-6}$, an AU-scale Yukawa tail, or a ultralight DM (ULDM) line in clocks/atom interferometers in space (AIS) -- triggers a joint refit of cosmology and Solar-System data under a common microphysical parameterization $\{V(\phi),A(\phi)\}$. In a guardrail branch, Solar-System tests enforce constraints (EEP; PPN parameters $\gamma,\beta$; and $\dot G/G$) and close unscreened or weakly screened corners indicated by cosmology. We forecast, per conjunction, $|\gamma-1|\lesssim (2-5)\times 10^{-6}$ (Ka-/X-band or optical Shapiro), $\eta_{EEP}\sim (1\mbox{--}10)\times 10^{-17}$ (drag-free AIS), $|\dot G/G|\sim(3-5)\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (sub-mm-class LLR), a uniform ~2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $(3-10)\times$ improved ULDM-coupling reach from clocks. For a conformal benchmark, $\mu_{ lin,0}=0.10$ implies $\chi\simeq \sqrt{\mu_{lin,0}/2}$ and a Sun thin shell $\Delta R/R\lesssim (1/3\chi)\sqrt{|\gamma-1|/2}=2.4\times 10^{-3}$ at $|\gamma-1|=5\times 10^{-6}$; Vainshtein screening at 1 AU yields $|\gamma-1|\lesssim 10^{-11}$, naturally below near-term reach. We recommend a cost-effective guardrail+discovery portfolio with explicit triggers for escalation to dedicated missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</description>

      <title>Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black-hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshifts ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshifts ($z \sim 1$) around those masses, compatible with such a peak. When related to the time-delay distribution from progenitor formation to binary black-hole merger, our results suggest a short-delay, dense-environment origin for sources contributing to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature at high redshifts, and longer delays at lower redshifts compatible with isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we studied the critical behavior and phase transition of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. The interesting behaviour of free energy stems from the fact that the constraints we introduced to handle the gravitational constant on CFT and the AdS radius differ from conventional approaches. Using the criticality equation, we numerically found the critical points of the zeroth-order and first-order phase transition for $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$. The relationships between conjugate thermodynamic pairs (equation of state) were also examined. In the case of the $p-\mathcal{V}$, $\tilde{T}-\tilde{S}$ and $\tilde{\Phi}-\tilde{Q}$ conjugate pairs, characteristics that are analogous to the first-order phase transition of van der Waals fluids were found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.</description>
