      <title>Ringel's contributions to quasi-hereditary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-hereditary algebras were introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott to describe the highest weight categories of representations of semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups by the module categories of finite-dimensional algebras. Since then a lot of homological, structural and categorical properties of quasi-hereditary algebras have been discovered. This class of algebras seems quite common and occurs in many branches of mathematics. There are lots of important works on the subject. In this note we mainly survey some of Claus Michael Ringel's works or works jointly with his collaborators on quasi-hereditary algebras. Also, some of related works and recent developments on quasi-hereditary algebras are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Algebro-geometric bootstrapping from OPE decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that decoupling relations in the operator product expansion of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) are encoded by an algebro-geometric object: a bifiltered affine scheme. We demonstrate how this scheme reproduces the Macdonald index (thus the Schur index) as well as the Higgs branch. Although the associated scheme typically admits continuous deformations, we find that a geometric extremization principle uniquely fixes these moduli, thereby providing a possible geometric route toward a classification of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Courbes et fibr\'es vectoriels en th\'eorie de Hodge $z$-adique globale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global analogue of the Fargues-Fontaine curve over function fields $F$. We prove some foundational results about its moduli of $G$-bundles $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$, which is a geometrization of the global Kottwitz set $B(F,G)$. For example, $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$ plays the role of Igusa stacks over function fields. We use $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$ to reformulate the global Langlands conjecture for $G$ over $F$ in terms of categorical local Langlands, refining conjectures of Arinkin-Gaitsgory-Kazhdan-Raskin-Rozenblyum-Varshavsky and Zhu. Finally, we verify this conjecture when $G$ is commutative. Along the way, we prove a GAGA theorem for smooth proper schemes over sousperfectoid spaces, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diagonal F-thresholds for determinants and Pfaffians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the diagonal F-thresholds of determinantal hypersurfaces arising from a generic matrix and from a generic symmetric matrix, as well as of the Pfaffian hypersurface arising from a generic skew-symmetric matrix of even size. The main ingredient is a cohomology vanishing theorem for certain line bundles on flag varieties in characteristic $p$. In the cases of the generic matrix and the generic skew-symmetric matrix, we show that the diagonal F-threshold attains its minimal possible value, namely the negative of the a-invariant. The symmetric case is more subtle and relies in addition on a polynomiality result for representations afforded by cohomology, building on work of the second author with VandeBogert.</description>

      <title>Estimating the spectral radius of Bell-type operator via finite dimensional approximation of orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new decomposition formula for two orthogonal projections P and Q on a separable Hilbert space V. This formula yields an orthogonal direct sum decomposition of V into invariant subspaces under P and Q, each of which is either at most two dimensional or infinite dimensional. On every infinite dimensional component, the pair (P,Q) admits a matrix representation that we call the "one-shifted form". This representation diagonalizes both P and Q into blocks of size at most two, and moreover, both projections can be explicitly approximated by orthogonal projections on finite dimensional subspaces. This approximation scheme offers a way to derive infinite dimensional results from their finite dimensional counterparts and is also useful in numerical computations.
  This decomposition provides a useful framework for analyzing a wide range of problems involving two orthogonal projections in infinite dimensions. In particular, several spectral problems for operators generated by P and Q (including polynomials in P and Q) can be reduced to the case where the pair admits a one-shifted form.
  More concretely, we can estimate the spectral radius of [P,Q], which is equivalent to estimating the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator, a quantity of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. We provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [P,Q], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are in "constant-angle one-shifted form".</description>

      <title>Quantum cluster algebra, braid moves and quantum virtual Grothendieck ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum virtual Grothendieck ring, denoted by $\frakK_q(\g)$, which was introduced in [39], and further investigated in [26, 25]. Our approach involves examining this ring from two perspectives: first, by considering its connection to quantum cluster algebras of non-skew-symmetric types; and second, by exploring its relevance to categorification theory. We specifically focus on (i) the homomorphisms that arise from braid moves, particularly 4-moves and 6-moves, in the braid group; and (ii) the quantum Laurent positivity phenomena, which has not yet been proven for non-skew-symmetric types.
  As applications of our results, we derive the substitution formulas for non-skew-symmetric types discussed in [11] for skew-symmetric types, and demonstrate that any truncated element in a heart subring, denoted by $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$, which corresponds to a simple module over the quiver Hecke algebra $R^\g$, possesses coefficients in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. This result is particularly interesting because it implies that each truncated Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomial in $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$ and each element in the standard basis $\sfE_q(\g)$ of the entire ring $\frakK_q(\g)$ have coefficients also in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$.
  Since (truncated) Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomials can be obtained using a quantum cluster algebra algorithm and appear as quantum cluster variables, they provide compelling evidence in support of the quantum Laurent positivity conjecture in non-skew-symmetric types.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>
