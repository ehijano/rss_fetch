      <title>On the Residual-based Neural Network for Unmodeled Distortions in Coordinate Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinate transformation models often fail to account for nonlinear and spatially dependent distortions, leading to significant residual errors in geospatial applications. Here we propose a residual-based neural correction strategy, in which a neural network learns to model only the systematic distortions left by an initial geometric transformation. By focusing solely on residual patterns, the proposed method reduces model complexity and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse or structured control point configurations. We evaluate the method using both simulated datasets with varying distortion intensities and sampling strategies, as well as under the real-world image georeferencing tasks. Compared with direct neural network coordinate converter and classical transformation models, the residual-based neural correction delivers more accurate and stable results under challenging conditions, while maintaining comparable performance in ideal cases. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of residual modelling as a lightweight and robust alternative for improving coordinate transformation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust acoustic and elastic full waveform inversion by adaptive Tikhonov-TV regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a powerful wave-based imaging technique, but its inherent ill-posedness and non-convexity lead to local minima and poor convergence. Regularization methods stabilize FWI by incorporating prior information and enforcing structural constraints like smooth variations or piecewise-constant behavior. Among them, Tikhonov regularization promotes smoothness, while total variation (TV) regularization preserves sharp boundaries. However, in the context of FWI, we highlight two key shortcomings of these regularization methods. First, subsurface model parameters (P- and S-wave velocities, density) often exhibit complex geological formations with sharp discontinuities separating distinct layers, while parameters within each layer vary smoothly. Neither Tikhonov nor TV regularization alone can effectively constrain such piecewise-smooth structures. Second, and more critically, when the initial model is far from the true model, these regularization assumptions can lead to a local minimum. To address these issues, we propose adaptive Tikhonov-TV (TT) regularization, which decomposes the model into smooth and blocky components, enabling robust recovery of piecewise-smooth structures. Implemented within the ADMM framework, TT regularization incorporates an automated balancing strategy based on robust statistical analysis. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI using benchmark geological models demonstrate that TT regularization significantly improves convergence and reconstruction accuracy compared to Tikhonov and TV regularization when applied separately. We show that for complex models and remote initial models, both Tikhonov and TV regularization tend to converge to local minima, whereas TT regularization effectively mitigates cycle skipping through its adaptive combination of the two regularization strategies.</description>

      <title>Identifying the approach of a major earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the seismicity in natural time and studying the evolution of the fluctuations of the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal for various scales of different length i (number of events), we can identify the approach of a major earthquake (EQ) occurrence. The current investigation is extended from 1984 until 2025 for the seismicity in Japan.</description>
