      <title>All-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state of fluids in the diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new all-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume (PVT) equation of state (EOS) of fluids and transparent solids in the diamond anvil high pressure cell, by measuring the changes in refractive index and sample volume upon pressure increase. Furthermore, we combine this with a new analysis method which exploits the mutual dependence of sample density and refractive index: Experimentally, the refractive index determines the measured sample chamber thickness (and therefore sample volume/density), yet the sample density is by far the dominant factor in determining the variation in refractive index with pressure. Our analysis method allows us to obtain a set of values for the density and refractive index which are mutually consistent, and agree with the experimental data within error. We have conducted proof-of-concept experiments on a variety of samples (H$_{2}$O, CH$_{4}$, C$_{2}$H$_{6}$, C$_{3}$H$_{8}$, KCl and NaCl) at ambient temperature, and at high temperatures up to just above 500 K. Our proof-of-concept data demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce known fluid and solid EOS within error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method allows us to directly and routinely measure the PVT EOS of simple fluids at GPa pressures up to, at least, 514 K (the highest temperature reached in our study). A reasonable estimation of the known sources of error in our volume determinations indicates that the error is currently $\pm$ 2.7% at high temperature, and that it is feasible to reduce it to ca. $\pm$ 1% in future work.</description>

      <title>Modulating Relaxation Time in Boundary-Dissipative Systems via Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>
