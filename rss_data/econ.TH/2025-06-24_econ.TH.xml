      <title>Network Heterogeneity and Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how payoff heterogeneity affects the value of information in beauty contest games. I show that public information provision is detrimental to welfare if and only if agents' Katz-Bonacich centralities exhibit specific forms of heterogeneity, stemming from the network of coordination motives. A key insight is that agents may value the commonality of information so differently that some are harmed by their neighbors knowing what others know. Leveraging this insight, I also show that when the commonality of information is endogenously determined through information sharing, the equilibrium degree of information sharing can be inefficiently low, even without sharing costs.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatization of the Random Priority Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of assigning indivisible objects to agents where each is to receive at most one. To ensure fairness in the absence of monetary compensation, we consider random assignments. Random Priority, also known as Random Serial Dictatorship, is characterized by equal-treatment-of-equals, ex-post efficiency and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity -- whenever preferences change so that a given deterministic assignment is ranked weakly higher by all agents, the probability of that assignment arising should be weakly larger. Probabilistic monotonicity implies strategy-proofness (in a stochastic dominance sense) for random assignment problems and is equivalent to it on the universal domain of strict preferences; for deterministic rules it coincides with Maskin monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Interim correlated rationalizability in large games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide general theoretical foundations for modeling strategic uncertainty in large distributional Bayesian games with general type spaces, using a version of interim correlated rationalizability. We then focus on the case in which payoff functions are supermodular in actions, as is common in the literature on global games. This structure allows us to identify extremal interim correlated rationalizable solutions with extremal interim Bayes-Nash equilibria. Notably, no order structure on types is assumed. We illustrate our framework and results using the large versions of the electronic mail game and a global game.</description>

      <title>Broad Validity of the First-Order Approach in Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order approach (FOA) is the main tool for the moral hazard principal-agent problem. Although many existing results rely on the FOA, its validity has been established only under relatively restrictive assumptions. We demonstrate in examples that the FOA frequently fails when the agent's reservation utility is low (such as in principal-optimal contracts). However, the FOA broadly holds when the agent's reservation utility is at least moderately high (such as in competitive settings where agents receive high rents). Our main theorem formalizes this point. The theorem shows that the FOA is valid in a standard limited liability model when the agent's reservation utility is sufficiently high. The theorem also establishes existence and uniqueness of the optimal contract. We use the theorem to derive tractable optimal contracts across several settings. Under log utility, option contracts are optimal for numerous common output distributions (including Gaussian, exponential, binomial, Gamma, and Laplace).</description>

      <title>Disaster Risk Financing through Taxation: A Framework for Regional Participation in Collective Risk-Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an economy composed of different risk profile regions wishing to be hedged against a disaster risk using multi-region catastrophe insurance. Such catastrophic events inherently have a systemic component; we consider situations where the insurer faces a non-zero probability of insolvency. To protect the regions against the risk of the insurer's default, we introduce a public-private partnership between the government and the insurer. When a disaster generates losses exceeding the total capital of the insurer, the central government intervenes by implementing a taxation system to share the residual claims. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework for regional participation in collective risk-sharing through tax revenues by accounting for their disaster risk profiles and their economic status.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation with Money: What is Your Objective?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When allocating indivisible items, there are various ways to use monetary transfers for eliminating envy. Particularly, one can apply a balanced vector of transfer payments, or charge each agent a positive amount, or -- contrarily -- give each agent a positive amount as a ``subsidy''. In each model, one can aim to minimize the amount of payments used; this aim translates into different optimization objectives in each setting. This note compares the various models, and the relations between upper and lower bounds for these objectives.</description>

      <title>From Doubt to Devotion: Trials and Learning-Based Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An informed seller designs a dynamic mechanism to sell an experience good. The seller has partial information about the product match, which affects the buyer's private consumption experience. We characterize equilibrium mechanisms of this dynamic informed principal problem. The belief gap between the informed seller and the uninformed buyer, coupled with the buyer's learning, gives rise to mechanisms that provide the skeptical buyer with limited access to the product and an option to upgrade if the buyer is swayed by a good experience. Depending on the seller's screening technology, this takes the form of free/discounted trials or tiered pricing, which are prevalent in digital markets. In contrast to static environments, having consumer data can reduce sellers' revenue in equilibrium, as they fine-tune the dynamic design with their data forecasting the buyer's learning process.</description>

      <title>Information About Other Players in Mechanism Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mechanism design settings where the planner has an interest in agents receiving noisy signals about the types of other agents. We show that additional information about other agents can eliminate undesired equilibria, making it helpful to a planner interested in full implementation, designing a mechanism for which every equilibrium outcome is desirable. We provide a sufficient condition under which a social choice function that is not fully implementable when agents have no information about types of other agents can become fully implementable when agents have additional information.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by advection-diffusion in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies spatial patterns formed by proximate population migration driven by real wage gradients and other idiosyncratic factors. The model consists of a tractable core-periphery model incorporating a quasi-linear log utility function and an advection-diffusion equation that expresses population migration. It is found that diffusion stabilizes a homogeneous stationary solution when transport costs are sufficiently low, and it also inhibits the monotonic facilitation of agglomeration caused by lower transport costs in some cases. When the homogeneous stationary solution is unstable, numerical simulations show spatial patterns with multiple urban areas. Insights into the relation between agglomeration and control parameters (transport costs and preference for variety of consumers) gained from the large-time behavior of solutions confirm the validity of the analysis of linearized equations.</description>

      <title>The Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is an optimization problem that involves determining optimal routes and schedules for several vehicles to pick up and deliver items at minimum cost. Motivated by real-world carpooling and crowdshipping scenarios, we introduce an additional constraint imposing a maximum number on the number of pickups per trip. This results in the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip (DARP-LPT). We apply a fragment-based method for DARP-LPT, where a fragment is a partial path. Specifically, we extend two formulations from Rist &amp; Forbes (2021): the Fragment Flow Formulation (FFF) and the Fragment Assignment Formulation (FAF). We establish FFF's superiority over FAF, both from a theoretical as well as from a computational perspective. Furthermore, our results show that FFF and FAF significantly outperform traditional arc-based formulations in terms of solution quality and time. Additionally, compared to the two existing fragment sets, one with longer partial paths and another with shorter ones, our newly generated fragment sets perform better in terms of solution quality and time when fed into FFF.</description>

      <title>Locational Energy Storage Bid Bounds for Facilitating Social Welfare Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to generate bid bounds that can serve as offer caps for energy storage in electricity markets to help reduce system costs and regulate potential market power exercises. We derive the bid bounds based on a tractable multi-period economic dispatch chance-constrained formulation that systematically incorporates the uncertainty and risk preference of the system operator. The key analytical results verify that the bounds effectively cap storage bids across all uncertainty scenarios with a guaranteed confidence level. We show that bid bounds decrease as the state of charge increases but rise with greater netload uncertainty and risk preference. We test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing mechanism based on the 8-bus ISO-NE test system, including agent-based storage bidding models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bid bounds effectively align storage bids with the social welfare objective and outperform existing deterministic bid bounds. Under 30% renewable capacity and 20% storage capacity, the bid bounds contribute to an average reduction of 0.17% in system cost, while increasing storage profit by an average of 10.16% across various system uncertainty scenarios and bidding strategies. These benefits scale up with increased storage economic withholding and storage capacity.</description>
