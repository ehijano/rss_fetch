      <title>Computer-Assisted Global Analysis for Vibro-Impact Dynamics: A Reduced Smooth Maps Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for studying the global dynamics of a vibro-impact pair, that is, a ball moving in a harmonically forced capsule. Motivated by a specific context of vibro-impact energy harvesting, we develop the method with broader non-smooth systems in mind. The seeming complications of the impacts of the ball with the capsule are exploited as useful non-smooth features in selecting appropriate return maps. This choice yields a computationally efficient framework for constructing return maps on short-time realizations from the state space of possible initial conditions rather than via long-time simulations often used to generate more traditional maps. The different dynamics in sub-regions in the state space yield a small collection of reduced polynomial approximations. Combined into a piecewise composite map, these capture transient and attracting behaviors and reproduce bifurcation sequences of the full system. Further ``separable'' reductions of the composite map provide insight into both transient and global dynamics. This composite map is valuable for cobweb analysis, which opens the door to computer-assisted global analysis and is realized via conservative auxiliary maps based on the extreme bounds of the maps in each subregion. We study the global dynamics of energetically favorable states and illustrate the potential of this approach in broader classes of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiple mixing in ergodic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1949 V.A. Rokhlin introduced into ergodic theory the k-fold mixing and puzzled the mathematical community with the problem of the mismatch of these invariants. Here's what Rokhlin wrote:
  "The proposed work arose from the author's attempts to solve the well-known spectral problem of the theory of dynamical systems: are there any metrically different dynamical systems with the same continuous (in particular, Lebesgue) spectrum? Using new metric invariants introduced for this purpose, the author tried to find among the ergodic automorphisms of compact commutative groups automorphisms of various metric types. It turned out, however, that for all the indicated automorphisms the new invariants are exactly the same."
  We discuss this long time open problem.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Uniform vector-valued pointwise ergodic theorems for operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a uniform vector-valued Wiener-Wintner Theorem for a class of operators that includes compositions of ergodic Koopman operators with contractive multiplication operators, and even some operators that are not $L^1$-contractions. Our methods are general enough to apply to situations in which our operator is ergodic, weakly mixing, mildly mixing, or strongly mixing. This allows to obtain uniform pointwise ergodic theorems for operators that are ergodic or mildly mixing, which are new even for Koopman operators. Our method of proof is to view $\xi := (T^nf(x))_{n = 1}^\infty$ as an element of a Ces\`aro sequence space, which we then map into a subspace of an ultraproduct space that possesses a natural shift operator $S$. Weighted pointwise ergodic theorems then correspond to dual pairings $\langle \xi,g^\prime\rangle = 0$, where we have, for example, that $\xi$ is weakly mixing with respect to $S$ and $g^\prime$ is compact with respect to $S^*$.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in Modern Heterogeneous Power Networks with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronized operation of generators in a power network is paramount to the stability and reliability of energy delivery. In this paper, we address the synchronization problem in a heterogeneous power grid, consisting of both synchronous generators and inverter-based generators, and derive the necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the existence of a unique locally stable synchronized mode. Further, our results have implications for utilizing grid-following inverters versus grid-forming inverters in order to enhance network stability. This work is of particular importance as power grids around the world are undergoing a transition from being predominantly composed of synchronous generators towards a grid consisting of a preponderance of inverter based generators.</description>

      <title>On the minimal memory set of cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a finite set $A$, a cellular automaton (CA) is a transformation $\tau : A^G \to A^G$ defined via a finite memory set $S \subseteq G$ and a local map $\mu : A^S \to A$. Although memory sets are not unique, every CA admits a unique minimal memory set, which consists on all the essential elements of $S$ that affect the behavior of the local map. In this paper, we study the links between the minimal memory set and the generating patterns $\mathcal{P}$ of $\mu$; these are the patterns in $A^S$ that are not fixed when the cellular automaton is applied. In particular, we show that when $\vert \mathcal{P} \vert$ is not a multiple of $\vert A \vert$, then the minimal memory set is $S$ or $S \setminus \{e\}$. Moreover, when $\vert \mathcal{P} \vert = \vert A \vert$, and the action of $\mu$ on these patterns is well-behaved, then the minimal memory set is $S$ or $S \setminus \{s\}$, for some $s \in S \setminus \{e\}$. These are some of the first general theoretical results on the minimal memory set of a cellular automaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the tree models of mildly dissipative diffeomorphisms on the disk $\D$. These models are one-dimensional dynamical systems with ergodic aperiodic data as well as some properties of the original dynamics.

      <title>Construction of Fractal Functions Using Kannan Mappings and Smoothness Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let T be a self-map on a metric space (X, d). Then T is called the Kannan map if there exists \alpha, 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2, such that d(T(x), T(y)) &lt;= \alpha[d(x, T(x)) + d(y, T(y))], for all x, y in X.
  This paper aims to introduce a new method to construct fractal functions using Kannan mappings. First, we give the rigorous construction of fractal functions with the help of the Kannan iterated function system (IFS). We also show the existence of a Borel probability measure supported on the attractor of the Kannan IFS satisfying the strong separation condition. Moreover, we study the smoothness of the constructed fractal functions. We end the paper with some examples and graphical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Time Scale Calculus: A New Approach to Multi-Dose Pharmacokinetic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Time Scale Calculus (TSC) to formulate and solve pharmacokinetic models exploring multiple dose dynamics. TSC is a mathematical framework that allows the modeling of dynamical systems comprising continuous and discrete processes. This characteristic makes TSC particularly suited for multi-dose pharmacokinetic problems, which inherently feature a blend of continuous processes (such as absorption, metabolization, and elimination) and discrete events (drug intake). We use this toolkit to derive analytical expressions for blood concentration trajectories under various multi-dose regimens across several flagship pharmacokinetic models. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework furnishes an alternative and simplified way to model and retrieve analytical solutions for multi-dose dynamics. For instance, it enables the study of blood concentration responses to arbitrary dose regimens and facilitates the characterization of the long-term behavior of the solutions, such as their steady state.</description>

      <title>Phase portraits for quadratic systems possessing an infinite elliptic-saddle or an infinite nilpotent saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a global study of the class $\bf{Q}{\widehat{ES}}$ of all real quadratic polynomial differential systems possessing exactly one elemental infinite singular point and one triple infinite singular point, which is either an infinite nilpotent elliptic-saddle or a nilpotent saddle. This class can be divided into three different families, namely, $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(A)}}$ of phase portraits possessing three real finite singular points, $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(B)}}$ of phase portraits possessing one real and two complex finite singular points, and $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(C)}}$ of phase portraits possessing one real triple finite singular point. Here we provide the complete study of the geometry of these three families. Modulo the action of the affine group and time homotheties, families $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(A)}}$ and $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(B)}}$ are three-dimensional and family $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(C)}}$ is two-dimensional. We study the respective bifurcation diagrams of their closures with respect to specific normal forms, in subsets of real Euclidean spaces. The bifurcation diagram of family $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(A)}}$ (respectively, $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(B)}}$ and $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(C)}}$) yields 1274 (respectively, 89 and 14) subsets with 91 (respectively, 27 and 12) topologically distinct phase portraits for systems in the closure $\overline{\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(A)}}}$ (respectively, $\overline{\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(B)}}}$ and $\overline{\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(C)}}}$) within the representatives of $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(A)}}$ (respectively, $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(B)}}$ and $\bf{Q}{{\widehat{ES}(C)}}$) given by a specific normal form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w=(w_1,\dots,w_d)$ be a $d$-tuple of positive real numbers such that $\sum_{i}w_i =1$ and $w_1\geq \cdots \geq w_d$. A $d$-dimensional vector $x=(x_1,\dots,x_d)\in\mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be $w$-singular if for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $T_0&gt;1$ such that for all $T&gt;T_0$ the system of inequalities \[ \max_{1\leq i\leq d}|qx_i - p_i|^{\frac{1}{w_i}} &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{T} \quad\text{and}\quad 0&lt;q&lt;T \] have an integer solution $(\mathbf{p},q)=(p_1,\dots,p_d,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^d \times \mathbb{Z}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $w$-singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is bounded below by $d-\frac{1}{1+w_1}$. Our result partially extends the previous result of Liao et al. [Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, J. Eur. Math. Soc. 22 (2020), 833-875].</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a rational function with degree $\geq 2$ and $X$ be its Julia set, its Fatou set, or the Riemann sphere. Suppose that $X$ is not empty. We can regard $R$ as a continuous map from $X$ onto itself. Kajiwara and Watatani showed that in the case that $X$ is the Julia set, $C_0(X)$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$, where $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$ denotes the C*-algebra associated with the dynamical system $(X,R)$ introduced by them. In this paper, we develop their result and give the equivalent condition for $C_0(X)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$.</description>

As a consequence, we obtain a connectedness result for generic lattices arising from Diophantine approximation on analytic submanifolds, and sharpen Schmidt and Summerer's results of connectedness on simultaneous Diophantine approximation and approximation by linear forms.</description>

      <title>Simplicity bias, algorithmic probability, and the random logistic map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicity bias is an intriguing phenomenon prevalent in various input-output maps, characterized by a preference for simpler, more regular, or symmetric outputs. Notably, these maps typically feature high-probability outputs with simple patterns, whereas complex patterns are exponentially less probable. This bias has been extensively examined and attributed to principles derived from algorithmic information theory and algorithmic probability. In a significant advancement, it has been demonstrated that the renowned logistic map and other one-dimensional maps exhibit simplicity bias when conceptualized as input-output systems. Building upon this work, our research delves into the manifestations of simplicity bias within the random logistic map, specifically focusing on scenarios involving additive noise.
  We discover that simplicity bias is observable in the random logistic map for specific ranges of $\mu$ and noise magnitudes. Additionally, we find that this bias persists even with the introduction of small measurement noise, though it diminishes as noise levels increase. Our studies also revisit the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos, particularly when $\mu=3.83$, revealing its characteristics through complexity-probability plots. Intriguingly, we employ the logistic map to illustrate a paradoxical aspect of data analysis: more data adhering to a consistent trend can occasionally lead to \emph{reduced} confidence in extrapolation predictions, challenging conventional wisdom.
  We propose that adopting a probability-complexity perspective in analyzing dynamical systems could significantly enrich statistical learning theories related to series prediction and analysis. This approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of simplicity bias and its implications but also paves the way for novel methodologies in forecasting complex systems behavior.</description>
