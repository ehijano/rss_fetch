      <title>Thrust Regulation in a Solid Fuel Ramjet using Dynamic Mode Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of a novel data-driven adaptive control technique, called dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC), for regulating thrust in a solid fuel ramjet (SFRJ). A high-fidelity computational model incorporating compressible flow theory and equilibrium chemistry is used to simulate the combustion dynamics. An adaptive tracking controller is designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller synthesized around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC provides an effective and reliable approach for thrust regulation in SFRJs. In addition, a systematic hyperparameter sensitivity study is conducted by varying the tuning parameters over several orders of magnitude. The resulting responses show that the closed-loop performance and tracking error remain stable across wide parameter variations, indicating that DMAC exhibits strong robustness to hyper parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Deep learning parameter estimation and quantum control of single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control, a central concept in physics and chemistry, has sparked significant interest due to its ability to fine-tune interference effects in atoms and individual molecules for applications ranging from light-harvesting complexes to molecular qubits. However, precise characterization of the system's dissipative dynamics is required for its implementation, especially at high temperature. In a quantum control experiment, this means learning system-bath parameters and driving coupling strengths. Here, we demonstrate how to infer key physical parameters of a single molecule driven by spectrally modulated pulses at room temperature. We develop and compare two computational approaches based on two-photon absorption photoluminescence signals: an optimization-based minimization scheme and a feed-forward neural network. The robustness of our approach highlights the importance of reliable parameter estimation in designing effective coherent control protocols. Our results have direct applications in ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum materials and technology.</description>

      <title>Transformation Journey of Zr-based MOFs: Study on Mechanics and Hydrogen Storage under Doping Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the transformation journey of Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), focusing on enhancing their mechanical properties and hydrogen storage capacities through doping regulation. MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Reduction of Transfer Operators for Particle Clustering Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operator-based framework to coarse-grain interacting particle systems that exhibit clustering dynamics. Starting from the particle-based transfer operator, we first construct a sequence of reduced representations: the operator is projected onto concentrations and then further reduced by representing the concentration dynamics on a geometric low-dimensional manifold and an adapted finite-state discretization. The resulting coarse-grained transfer operator is finally estimated from dynamical simulation data by inferring the transition probabilities between the Markov states. Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states. Spectral analysis and transition-path analysis of the estimated operator reveal implied time scales and dominant transition pathways, providing an interpretable and efficient description of particle-clustering dynamics.</description>

      <title>DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>What Is the Minimum Number of Parameters Required to Represent Solutions of the Grad-Shafranov Equation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate solutions of the Grad--Shafranov (GS) equation are essential for equilibrium analysis, integrated modeling, and surrogate model construction in magnetic confinement fusion. In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Coil Matching Toolbox for Magnetic Stimulation and Other Electromagnetics (COMATOSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coil in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) determines the spatial shape of the electromagnetic field in the head, which structures are concurrently activated, and how focal stimulation is. Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave substantial room for lots of improvements. Techniques for rigorous mathematical optimization have been developed but are only available to very few groups worldwide. This paper presents an open-source toolbox, COMATOSE, to change that situation and make these methods available to a wider community. It incorporates the fundamental formalisms and offers vector space decomposition as well as base mapping as an explicit forward method, which is computationally less demanding than iterative computational optimization but can also form the initial solution for a subsequent optimization run if desired.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

Abstract: We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular, it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM) and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive Potential-Barrier Affinity Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Cut-Cell Two-Fluid Method for Two-Phase Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of diffusive flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and surfaces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate a superlinear convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.</description>
