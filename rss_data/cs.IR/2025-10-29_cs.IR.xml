      <title>Resource-Efficient LLM Application for Structured Transformation of Unstructured Financial Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized, machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose, but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>DUET: Dual Model Co-Training for Entire Space CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-ranking stage plays a pivotal role in large-scale recommender systems but faces an intrinsic trade-off between model expressiveness and computational efficiency. Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints, industry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are computationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result, they struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships among candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent and diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on biased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with distinct distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DUET} (\textbf{DU}al Model Co-Training for \textbf{E}ntire Space C\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise pre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight computational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs set-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass, enabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the computational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism extends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement, effectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present, DUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>Metadata-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Financial Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced. This paper presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings, benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual chunks"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance. Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling, cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency. This study provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for financial document analysis.</description>

      <title>From Time and Place to Preference: LLM-Driven Geo-Temporal Context in Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recommender systems treat timestamps as numeric or cyclical values, overlooking real-world context such as holidays, events, and seasonal patterns. We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location, capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic, demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.</description>

      <title>MiniOneRec: An Open-Source Framework for Scaling Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size, validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together, these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and candidate diversity.</description>

      <title>Iterative Critique-Refine Framework for Enhancing LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Retrieval for RAG via Reinforced Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.</description>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Scenario Unified Modeling of User Interests at Billion Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.</description>

      <title>LIME: Link-based user-item Interaction Modeling with decoupled xor attention for Efficient test time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements.
  We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$).
  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Your Dense Retriever is Secretly an Expeditious Reasoner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense retrievers enhance retrieval by encoding queries and documents into continuous vectors, but they often struggle with reasoning-intensive queries. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can reformulate queries to capture complex reasoning, applying them universally incurs significant computational cost. In this work, we propose Adaptive Query Reasoning (AdaQR), a hybrid query rewriting framework. Within this framework, a Reasoner Router dynamically directs each query to either fast dense reasoning or deep LLM reasoning. The dense reasoning is achieved by the Dense Reasoner, which performs LLM-style reasoning directly in the embedding space, enabling a controllable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks BRIGHT show that AdaQR reduces reasoning cost by 28% while preserving-or even improving-retrieval performance by 7%.</description>

      <title>CustomIR: Unsupervised Fine-Tuning of Dense Embeddings for Known Document Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense embedding models have become critical for modern information retrieval, particularly in RAG pipelines, but their performance often degrades when applied to specialized corpora outside their pre-training distribution. To address thi we introduce CustomIR, a framework for unsupervised adaptation of pre-trained language embedding models to domain-specific corpora using synthetically generated query-document pairs. CustomIR leverages large language models (LLMs) to create diverse queries grounded in a known target corpus, paired with LLM-verified hard negatives, eliminating the need for costly human annotation. Experiments on enterprise email and messaging datasets show that CustomIR consistently improves retrieval effectiveness with small models gaining up to 2.3 points in Recall@10. This performance increase allows these small models to rival the performance of much larger alternatives, allowing for cheaper RAG deployments. These results highlight that targeted synthetic fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-efficient strategy for increasing domain-specific performance.</description>

Abstract: Interdisciplinary scientific research is increasingly important in knowledge production, funding policies, and academic discussions on scholarly communication. While many studies focus on interdisciplinary corpora defined a priori -usually through keyword-based searches within assumed interdisciplinary domains- few explore interdisciplinarity as an emergent intersection between two distinct fields. Thus, methodological proposals for building databases at the intersection of two fields of knowledge are scarce. The goal of this article is to develop and compare different strategies for defining an interdisciplinary corpus between two bodies of knowledge. As a case study, we focus on the intersection between neuroscience and computer science. To this end, we develop and compare four retrieval strategies, two of them based on keywords and two based on citation and reference patterns. Our results show that the reference-based strategy provides better retrieval, pseudorecall, and F1. While we focus on comparing strategies for the study of the intersection between the fields of neuroscience and computer science, this methodological reflection is applicable to a wide range of interdisciplinary domains.</description>

      <title>MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281</link>

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</description>
