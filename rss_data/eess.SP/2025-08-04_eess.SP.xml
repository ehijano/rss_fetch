      <title>Closed-form Expression for the Power Profile in Wideband Systems with Inter-channel Stimulated Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.</description>

      <title>RIS-MAE: A Self-Supervised Modulation Classification Method Based on Raw IQ Signals and Masked Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in intelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as spectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent years, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However, mainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use time-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key modulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication conditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a large amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments. To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called RIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from unlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking and reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as amplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable representations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it performs better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks. Notably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets with only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization ability and potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Deep Learning Enhanced Joint Beamforming and Mode Switching for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error (PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM) and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit elements (TEs), respectively.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-aided RSMA for the URLLC multi-user MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is intrinsically amalgamated with simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of the finite block length (FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming matrices, STAR-RIS configurations, and rate-splitting parameters. STAR-RIS attains 360-degree full-plane coverage, while RSMA provides a prominent gain by efficiently managing interference. Numerical results reveal a strong synergy between RSMA and STAR-RIS, demonstreating significant EE gains over reflective RIS and spatial division multiple access (SDMA).</description>

      <title>When Vision-Language Model (VLM) Meets Beam Prediction: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM) provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding. Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score (DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Extracting Skin Nerve Activity from Electrocardiogram Recorded at A Low Sampling Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been a promising non-invasive surrogate for accurate and effective assessment of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Typically, SKNA extraction requires a higher sampling frequency than the typical ECG recording requirement (&gt; 2 kHz) because analysis tools extract SKNA from the 0.5-1 kHz frequency band. However, ECG recording systems commonly provide a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or lower, particularly for wearable devices. Our recent power spectral analysis exhibited that 150-500 Hz frequency bands are dominant during sympathetic stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesize that SKNA can be extracted from ECG sampled at a lower sampling frequency. We collected ECG signals from 16 participants during SNS stimulation and resampled the signals at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our statistical analyses of significance, classification performance, and reliability indicate no significant difference between SKNA indices derived from ECG signals sampled at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices, which are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated guidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact contamination is minimal.</description>

      <title>Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter, enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Multibeam High Throughput Satellite: Hardware Foundation, Resource Allocation, and Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its wide coverage and uninterrupted service, satellite communication is a critical technology for next-generation 6G communications. High throughput satellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing techniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the growing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review the-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated challenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware foundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user terminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource allocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation schemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to non-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods for the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference cancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as single gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and hybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges related to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of gateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight development, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these topics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally delivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Classification under Noisy Labels: A Geometry-Aware Reliability Framework for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper, following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent adaptive-neighborhood baselines.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Trajectory Control and Resource Allocation in Multi-UAV-assisted MEC via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to improve the computational capacity of smart devices (SDs) in Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Beamformed 360{\deg} Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</description>

      <title>Active IRS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications with Extended Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), in which an active IRS is deployed to assist the base station (BS) in serving multiple communication users (CUs) and simultaneously sensing an \emph{extended} target at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. The active IRS has the capability of amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix. Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs, the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.</description>

      <title>LO-Aware Adaptive Modulation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery, existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points, ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals, it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Based Time-Frequency Fingerprinting for Feature Extraction of Traditional Irish Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a wavelet-based approach to time-frequency fingerprinting for time series feature extraction, with a focus on audio identification from live recordings of traditional Irish tunes. The challenges of identifying features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes. This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time series forecasting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document provides the supplementary materials for the paper Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding. The appendices present detailed mathematical derivations and proofs that support the analytical framework of the main paper. Specifically, we include: (i) cumulative distribution functions for ordered channel gains; (ii) probability density functions of normalized signal-plus-interference variances in NOMA dynamic SIC decoding; (iii) closed-form expressions for pairwise error probability (PEP) with two users; (iv) probability derivations for channel gain ordering in the two-UE case, specifically when UE 1 and UE 2 have the strongest or second strongest channel gains; (v) BER analysis for M-QAM modulation schemes including BPSK, 4QAM, 16QAM and 64QAM; (vi) PDF derivations for channel gains under various ordering conditions; and (vii) challenges of PDF derivations for real part of channel gain under various ordering condition. These mathematical foundations enable the closed-form BER analysis of uplink NOMA systems with dynamic SIC decoding under Rayleigh fading channels, supporting analytical expressions for various modulation schemes and system configurations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling, incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model. Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low model storage requirements.</description>

      <title>Criticality-Based Dynamic Topology Optimization for Enhancing Aerial-Marine Swarm Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous marine-aerial swarm networks encounter substantial difficulties due to targeted communication disruptions and structural weaknesses in adversarial environments. This paper proposes a two-step framework to strengthen the network's resilience. Specifically, our framework combines the node prioritization based on criticality with multi-objective topology optimization. First, we design a three-layer architecture to represent structural, communication, and task dependencies of the swarm networks. Then, we introduce the SurBi-Ranking method, which utilizes graph convolutional networks, to dynamically evaluate and rank the criticality of nodes and edges in real time. Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network topology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and mission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and edges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause more significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization approach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack, reduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher mission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs, ensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase operations.</description>

      <title>FMPlug: Plug-In Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.</description>

      <title>DoF Analysis and Beamforming Design for Active IRS-aided Multi-user MIMO Wireless Communication in Rank-deficient Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its ability of significantly improving data rate, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) will be a potential crucial technique for the future generation wireless networks like 6G. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network. Firstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the achievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding results are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the matrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called low-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over no-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented DoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize transmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt orthogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer leakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF. Simulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For example, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE aided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a significant DoF improvement in such a channel.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.</description>

      <title>HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

      <title>Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with non-convex functional constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order (SFO) complexity with adaptive step sizes closely matching that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail an obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time constructive decision algorithm for multivariable quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) have provided a unified framework for understanding many quantum algorithms, including factorization, matrix inversion, and Hamiltonian simulation. As a multivariable version of QSP, multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP) is proposed. M-QSP interleaves signal operators corresponding to each variable with signal processing operators, which provides an efficient means to perform multivariable polynomial transformations. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for what types of polynomials can be constructed by M-QSP is unknown. In this paper, we propose a classical algorithm to determine whether a given pair of multivariable Laurent polynomials can be implemented by M-QSP, which returns True or False. As one of the most important properties of this algorithm, it returning True is the necessary and sufficient condition. The proposed classical algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of variables and signal operators. Our algorithm also provides a constructive method to select the necessary parameters for implementing M-QSP. These findings offer valuable insights for identifying practical applications of M-QSP.</description>

      <title>Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable CONCH (CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images, text, and accelerometer data.</description>
