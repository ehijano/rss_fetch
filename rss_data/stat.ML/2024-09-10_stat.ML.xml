      <title>Benchmarking Estimators for Natural Experiments: A Novel Dataset and a Doubly Robust Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the effect of treatments from natural experiments, where treatments are pre-assigned, is an important and well-studied problem. We introduce a novel natural experiment dataset obtained from an early childhood literacy nonprofit. Surprisingly, applying over 20 established estimators to the dataset produces inconsistent results in evaluating the nonprofit's efficacy. To address this, we create a benchmark to evaluate estimator accuracy using synthetic outcomes, whose design was guided by domain experts. The benchmark extensively explores performance as real world conditions like sample size, treatment correlation, and propensity score accuracy vary. Based on our benchmark, we observe that the class of doubly robust treatment effect estimators, which are based on simple and intuitive regression adjustment, generally outperform other more complicated estimators by orders of magnitude. To better support our theoretical understanding of doubly robust estimators, we derive a closed form expression for the variance of any such estimator that uses dataset splitting to obtain an unbiased estimate. This expression motivates the design of a new doubly robust estimator that uses a novel loss function when fitting functions for regression adjustment. We release the dataset and benchmark in a Python package; the package is built in a modular way to facilitate new datasets and estimators.</description>

      <title>Sliding-Window Thompson Sampling for Non-Stationary Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Restless Bandits}$ describe sequential decision-making problems in which the rewards evolve with time independently from the actions taken by the policy-maker. It has been shown that classical Bandit algorithms fail when the underlying environment is changing, making clear that in order to tackle more challenging scenarios specifically crafted algorithms are needed. In this paper, extending and correcting the work by \cite{trovo2020sliding}, we analyze two Thompson-Sampling inspired algorithms, namely $\texttt{BETA-SWTS}$ and $\texttt{$\gamma$-SWGTS}$, introduced to face the additional complexity given by the non-stationary nature of the settings; in particular we derive a general formulation for the regret in $\textit{any}$ arbitrary restless environment for both Bernoulli and Subgaussian rewards, and, through the introduction of new quantities, we delve in what contribution lays the deeper foundations of the error made by the algorithms. Finally, we infer from the general formulation the regret for two of the most common non-stationary settings: the $\textit{Abruptly Changing}$ and the $\textit{Smoothly Changing}$ environments.</description>

      <title>Empowering Bayesian Neural Networks with Functional Priors through Anchored Ensembling for Mechanics Surrogate Modeling Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks (NNs) have become increasingly popular for surrogate modeling tasks in mechanics and materials modeling applications. While traditional NNs are deterministic functions that rely solely on data to learn the input--output mapping, casting NN training within a Bayesian framework allows to quantify uncertainties, in particular epistemic uncertainties that arise from lack of training data, and to integrate a priori knowledge via the Bayesian prior. However, the high dimensionality and non-physicality of the NN parameter space, and the complex relationship between parameters (NN weights) and predicted outputs, renders both prior design and posterior inference challenging. In this work we present a novel BNN training scheme based on anchored ensembling that can integrate a priori information available in the function space, from e.g. low-fidelity models. The anchoring scheme makes use of low-rank correlations between NN parameters, learnt from pre-training to realizations of the functional prior. We also perform a study to demonstrate how correlations between NN weights, which are often neglected in existing BNN implementations, is critical to appropriately transfer knowledge between the function-space and parameter-space priors. Performance of our novel BNN algorithm is first studied on a small 1D example to illustrate the algorithm's behavior in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. Then, a thorough assessment is performed on a multi--input--output materials surrogate modeling example, where we demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities both in terms of accuracy and quality of the uncertainty estimation, for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-adaptive Group Testing under Errors in Group Membership Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $p$ samples, each of which may or may not be defective, group testing (GT) aims to determine their defect status by performing tests on $n &lt; p$ `groups', where a group is formed by mixing a subset of the $p$ samples. Assuming that the number of defective samples is very small compared to $p$, GT algorithms have provided excellent recovery of the status of all $p$ samples with even a small number of groups. Most existing methods, however, assume that the group memberships are accurately specified. This assumption may not always be true in all applications, due to various resource constraints. Such errors could occur, eg, when a technician, preparing the groups in a laboratory, unknowingly mixes together an incorrect subset of samples as compared to what was specified. We develop a new GT method, the Debiased Robust Lasso Test Method (DRLT), that handles such group membership specification errors. The proposed DRLT method is based on an approach to debias, or reduce the inherent bias in, estimates produced by Lasso, a popular and effective sparse regression technique. We also provide theoretical upper bounds on the reconstruction error produced by our estimator. Our approach is then combined with two carefully designed hypothesis tests respectively for (i) the identification of defective samples in the presence of errors in group membership specifications, and (ii) the identification of groups with erroneous membership specifications. The DRLT approach extends the literature on bias mitigation of statistical estimators such as the LASSO, to handle the important case when some of the measurements contain outliers, due to factors such as group membership specification errors. We present numerical results which show that our approach outperforms several baselines and robust regression techniques for identification of defective samples as well as erroneously specified groups.</description>

      <title>Recursive Nested Filtering for Efficient Amortized Bayesian Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Inside-Out Nested Particle Filter (IO-NPF), a novel, fully recursive, algorithm for amortized sequential Bayesian experimental design in the non-exchangeable setting. We frame policy optimization as maximum likelihood estimation in a non-Markovian state-space model, achieving (at most) $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ computational complexity in the number of experiments. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and introduce a backward sampling algorithm to reduce trajectory degeneracy. IO-NPF offers a practical, extensible, and provably consistent approach to sequential Bayesian experimental design, demonstrating improved efficiency over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation Bounds for Recurrent Neural Networks with Application to Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximation capacity of deep ReLU recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and explore the convergence properties of nonparametric least squares regression using RNNs. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of RNNs for H\"older smooth functions, in the sense that the output at each time step of an RNN can approximate a H\"older function that depends only on past and current information, termed a past-dependent function. This allows a carefully constructed RNN to simultaneously approximate a sequence of past-dependent H\"older functions. We apply these approximation results to derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the prediction error of the empirical risk minimizer in regression problem. Our error bounds achieve minimax optimal rate under both exponentially $\beta$-mixing and i.i.d. data assumptions, improving upon existing ones. Our results provide statistical guarantees on the performance of RNNs.</description>

      <title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the feature is taken while keeping the dataset size ratio against the feature dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property for the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Optimal Projections for Classification with Naive Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Naive Bayes classification model the class conditional densities are estimated as the products of their marginal densities along the cardinal basis directions. We study the problem of obtaining an alternative basis for this factorisation with the objective of enhancing the discriminatory power of the associated classification model. We formulate the problem as a projection pursuit to find the optimal linear projection on which to perform classification. Optimality is determined based on the multinomial likelihood within which probabilities are estimated using the Naive Bayes factorisation of the projected data. Projection pursuit offers the added benefits of dimension reduction and visualisation. We discuss an intuitive connection with class conditional independent components analysis, and show how this is realised visually in practical applications. The performance of the resulting classification models is investigated using a large collection of (162) publicly available benchmark data sets and in comparison with relevant alternatives. We find that the proposed approach substantially outperforms other popular probabilistic discriminant analysis models and is highly competitive with Support Vector Machines.</description>

      <title>K-Fold Causal BART for CATE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to propose and evaluate a novel model named K-Fold Causal Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (K-Fold Causal BART) for improved estimation of Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). The study employs synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, including the widely recognized Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) benchmark dataset, to validate the model's performance. Despite promising results in synthetic scenarios, the IHDP dataset reveals that the proposed model is not state-of-the-art for ATE and CATE estimation. Nonetheless, the research provides several novel insights: 1. The ps-BART model is likely the preferred choice for CATE and ATE estimation due to better generalization compared to the other benchmark models - including the Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) model, which is considered by many the current best model for CATE estimation, 2. The BCF model's performance deteriorates significantly with increasing treatment effect heterogeneity, while the ps-BART model remains robust, 3. Models tend to be overconfident in CATE uncertainty quantification when treatment effect heterogeneity is low, 4. A second K-Fold method is unnecessary for avoiding overfitting in CATE estimation, as it adds computational costs without improving performance, 5. Detailed analysis reveals the importance of understanding dataset characteristics and using nuanced evaluation methods, 6. The conclusion of Curth et al. (2021) that indirect strategies for CATE estimation are superior for the IHDP dataset is contradicted by the results of this research. These findings challenge existing assumptions and suggest directions for future research to enhance causal inference methodologies.</description>

      <title>LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.</description>

      <title>Absolute Ranking: An Essential Normalization for Benchmarking Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating performance across optimization algorithms on many problems presents a complex challenge due to the diversity of numerical scales involved. Traditional data processing methods, such as hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference, often employ ranking-based methods to normalize performance values across these varying scales. However, a significant issue emerges with this ranking-based approach: the introduction of new algorithms can potentially disrupt the original rankings. This paper extensively explores the problem, making a compelling case to underscore the issue and conducting a thorough analysis of its root causes. These efforts pave the way for a comprehensive examination of potential solutions. Building on this research, this paper introduces a new mathematical model called "absolute ranking" and a sampling-based computational method. These contributions come with practical implementation recommendations, aimed at providing a more robust framework for addressing the challenge of numerical scale variation in the assessment of performance across multiple algorithms and problems.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning focuses on approximating mappings $\mathcal{G}^\dagger:\mathcal{U} \rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ between infinite-dimensional spaces of functions, such as $u: \Omega_u\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and $v: \Omega_v\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. This makes it particularly suitable for solving parametric nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). While most machine learning methods for operator learning rely on variants of deep neural networks (NNs), recent studies have shown that Gaussian Processes (GPs) are also competitive while offering interpretability and theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid GP/NN-based framework for operator learning that leverages the strengths of both methods. Instead of approximating the function-valued operator $\mathcal{G}^\dagger$, we use a GP to approximate its associated real-valued bilinear form $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}^\dagger: \mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}^*\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.$ This bilinear form is defined by $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}^\dagger(u,\varphi) := [\varphi,\mathcal{G}^\dagger(u)],$ which allows us to recover the operator $\mathcal{G}^\dagger$ through $\mathcal{G}^\dagger(u)(y)=\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}^\dagger(u,\delta_y).$ The GP mean function can be zero or parameterized by a neural operator and for each setting we develop a robust training mechanism based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that can optionally leverage the physics involved. Numerical benchmarks show that (1) it improves the performance of a base neural operator by using it as the mean function of a GP, and (2) it enables zero-shot data-driven models for accurate predictions without prior training. Our framework also handles multi-output operators where $\mathcal{G}^\dagger:\mathcal{U} \rightarrow\prod_{s=1}^S\mathcal{V}^s$, and benefits from computational speed-ups via product kernel structures and Kronecker product matrix representations.</description>

      <title>Whittle Index Learning Algorithms for Restless Bandits with Constant Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Whittle index learning algorithm for restless multi-armed bandits. We consider index learning algorithm with Q-learning. We first present Q-learning algorithm with exploration policies -- epsilon-greedy, softmax, epsilon-softmax with constant stepsizes. We extend the study of Q-learning to index learning for single-armed restless bandit. The algorithm of index learning is two-timescale variant of stochastic approximation, on slower timescale we update index learning scheme and on faster timescale we update Q-learning assuming fixed index value. In Q-learning updates are in asynchronous manner. We study constant stepsizes two timescale stochastic approximation algorithm. We provide analysis of two-timescale stochastic approximation for index learning with constant stepsizes. Further, we present study on index learning with deep Q-network (DQN) learning and linear function approximation with state-aggregation method. We describe the performance of our algorithms using numerical examples. We have shown that index learning with Q learning, DQN and function approximations learns the Whittle index.</description>

      <title>Notes on Sampled Gaussian Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we prove a recent conjecture posed in the paper by R\"ais\"a, O. et al. [Subsampling is not Magic: Why Large Batch Sizes Work for Differentially Private Stochastic Optimization (2024)]. Theorem 6.2 of the paper asserts that for the Sampled Gaussian Mechanism - a composition of subsampling and additive Gaussian noise, the effective noise level, $\sigma_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\sigma(q)}{q}$, decreases as a function of the subsampling rate $q$. Consequently, larger subsampling rates are preferred for better privacy-utility trade-offs. Our notes provide a rigorous proof of Conjecture 6.3, which was left unresolved in the original paper, thereby completing the proof of Theorem 6.2.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Memorization in the Presence of Statistical Biases in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to understand how statistical biases affect the model's ability to generalize to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on algorithmic tasks. Prior research indicates that transformers may inadvertently learn to rely on these spurious correlations, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capabilities. To investigate this, we evaluate transformer models on several synthetic algorithmic tasks, systematically introducing and varying the presence of these biases. We also analyze how different components of the transformer models impact their generalization. Our findings suggest that statistical biases impair the model's performance on out-of-distribution data, providing a overestimation of its generalization capabilities. The models rely heavily on these spurious correlations for inference, as indicated by their performance on tasks including such biases.</description>

      <title>Improving the Finite Sample Performance of Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Propensity Score Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are widely used for estimating causal effects. Double/debiased machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) uses a double-robust score function that relies on the prediction of nuisance functions, such as the propensity score, which is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on covariates. Estimators relying on double-robust score functions are highly sensitive to errors in propensity score predictions. Machine learners increase the severity of this problem as they tend to over- or underestimate these probabilities. Several calibration approaches have been proposed to improve probabilistic forecasts of machine learners. This paper investigates the use of probability calibration approaches within the DML framework. Simulation results demonstrate that calibrating propensity scores may significantly reduces the root mean squared error of DML estimates of the average treatment effect in finite samples. We showcase it in an empirical example and provide conditions under which calibration does not alter the asymptotic properties of the DML estimator.</description>

      <title>Centralized Selection with Preferences in the Presence of Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the scenario in which there are multiple institutions, each with a limited capacity for candidates, and candidates, each with preferences over the institutions. A central entity evaluates the utility of each candidate to the institutions, and the goal is to select candidates for each institution in a way that maximizes utility while also considering the candidates' preferences. The paper focuses on the setting in which candidates are divided into multiple groups and the observed utilities of candidates in some groups are biased--systematically lower than their true utilities. The first result is that, in these biased settings, prior algorithms can lead to selections with sub-optimal true utility and significant discrepancies in the fraction of candidates from each group that get their preferred choices. Subsequently, an algorithm is presented along with proof that it produces selections that achieve near-optimal group fairness with respect to preferences while also nearly maximizing the true utility under distributional assumptions. Further, extensive empirical validation of these results in real-world and synthetic settings, in which the distributional assumptions may not hold, are presented.</description>

      <title>NGD converges to less degenerate solutions than SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of free parameters, or dimension, of a model is a straightforward way to measure its complexity: a model with more parameters can encode more information. However, this is not an accurate measure of complexity: models capable of memorizing their training data often generalize well despite their high dimension. Effective dimension aims to more directly capture the complexity of a model by counting only the number of parameters required to represent the functionality of the model. Singular learning theory (SLT) proposes the learning coefficient $ \lambda $ as a more accurate measure of effective dimension. By describing the rate of increase of the volume of the region of parameter space around a local minimum with respect to loss, $ \lambda $ incorporates information from higher-order terms. We compare $ \lambda $ of models trained using natural gradient descent (NGD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and find that those trained with NGD consistently have a higher effective dimension for both of our methods: the Hessian trace $ \text{Tr}(\mathbf{H}) $, and the estimate of the local learning coefficient (LLC) $ \hat{\lambda}(w^*) $.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Learning with Shared Linear Representations: Statistical Rates and Optimal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative learning enables multiple clients to learn shared feature representations across local data distributions, with the goal of improving model performance and reducing overall sample complexity. While empirical evidence shows the success of collaborative learning, a theoretical understanding of the optimal statistical rate remains lacking, even in linear settings. In this paper, we identify the optimal statistical rate when clients share a common low-dimensional linear representation. Specifically, we design a spectral estimator with local averaging that approximates the optimal solution to the least squares problem. We establish a minimax lower bound to demonstrate that our estimator achieves the optimal error rate. Notably, the optimal rate reveals two distinct phases. In typical cases, our rate matches the standard rate based on the parameter counting of the linear representation. However, a statistical penalty arises in collaborative learning when there are too many clients or when local datasets are relatively small. Furthermore, our results, unlike existing ones, show that, at a system level, collaboration always reduces overall sample complexity compared to independent client learning. In addition, at an individual level, we provide a more precise characterization of when collaboration benefits a client in transfer learning and private fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>2DSig-Detect: a semi-supervised framework for anomaly detection on image data using 2D-signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies raises questions about the security of machine learning models, with respect to both training-time (poisoning) and test-time (evasion, impersonation, and inversion) attacks. Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.</description>

      <title>A Double Tracking Method for Optimization with Decentralized Generalized Orthogonality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decentralized optimization problems with generalized orthogonality constraints, where both the objective function and the constraint exhibit a distributed structure. Such optimization problems, albeit ubiquitous in practical applications, remain unsolvable by existing algorithms in the presence of distributed constraints. To address this issue, we convert the original problem into an unconstrained penalty model by resorting to the recently proposed constraint-dissolving operator. However, this transformation compromises the essential property of separability in the resulting penalty function, rendering it impossible to employ existing algorithms to solve. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel algorithm that tracks the gradient of the objective function and the Jacobian of the constraint mapping simultaneously. The global convergence guarantee is rigorously established with an iteration complexity. To substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we present numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of AdaGrad for Non-Convex Optimization via Novel Stopping Time-based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimizers have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on iterative gradients. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, although AdaGrad is a cornerstone adaptive optimizer, its theoretical analysis is inadequate in addressing asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates on non-convex optimization. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and complete picture of AdaGrad. We first introduce a novel stopping time technique from probabilistic theory to establish stability for the norm version of AdaGrad under milder conditions. We further derive two forms of asymptotic convergence: almost sure and mean-square. Furthermore, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is rarely explored and stronger than the existing high-probability results, under the mild assumptions. The techniques developed in this work are potentially independent of interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Clustering and Distribution Matching with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for clustering and distribution matching problems with bandit feedback. We consider a $K$-armed bandit model where some subset of $K$ arms is partitioned into $M$ groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value $\delta$. Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding $M$ pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and $M$-ary clustering of $K$ arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding $\delta$. Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank--Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as $\delta$ vanishes.</description>

      <title>Inference for Large Scale Regression Models with Dependent Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in data sizes and storage costs has brought considerable challenges to the data science community, requiring solutions to run learning methods on such data. While machine learning has scaled to achieve predictive accuracy in big data settings, statistical inference and uncertainty quantification tools are still lagging. Priority scientific fields collect vast data to understand phenomena typically studied with statistical methods like regression. In this setting, regression parameter estimation can benefit from efficient computational procedures, but the main challenge lies in computing error process parameters with complex covariance structures. Identifying and estimating these structures is essential for inference and often used for uncertainty quantification in machine learning with Gaussian Processes. However, estimating these structures becomes burdensome as data scales, requiring approximations that compromise the reliability of outputs. These approximations are even more unreliable when complexities like long-range dependencies or missing data are present. This work defines and proves the statistical properties of the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments with Exogenous variables (GMWMX), a highly scalable, stable, and statistically valid method for estimating and delivering inference for linear models using stochastic processes in the presence of data complexities like latent dependence structures and missing data. Applied examples from Earth Sciences and extensive simulations highlight the advantages of the GMWMX.</description>

      <title>Learning to Classify Quantum Phases of Matter with a Few Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the identification of quantum phases of matter, at zero temperature, when only part of the phase diagram is known in advance. Following a supervised learning approach, we show how to use our previous knowledge to construct an observable capable of classifying the phase even in the unknown region. By using a combination of classical and quantum techniques, such as tensor networks, kernel methods, generalization bounds, quantum algorithms, and shadow estimators, we show that, in some cases, the certification of new ground states can be obtained with a polynomial number of measurements. An important application of our findings is the classification of the phases of matter obtained in quantum simulators, e.g., cold atom experiments, capable of efficiently preparing ground states of complex many-particle systems and applying simple measurements, e.g., single qubit measurements, but unable to perform a universal set of gates.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we leverage powerful non-linear machine learning methods to identify the characteristics of trades that contain valuable information. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimized neural network predictor in accurately predicting future market movements. Then, we utilize the information from this successful neural network predictor to pinpoint the individual trades within each data point (trading window) that had the most impact on the optimized neural network's prediction of future price movements. This approach helps us uncover important insights about the heterogeneity in information content provided by trades of different sizes, venues, trading contexts, and over time.</description>

      <title>SEF: A Method for Computing Prediction Intervals by Shifting the Error Function in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's era, Neural Networks (NN) are applied in various scientific fields such as robotics, medicine, engineering, etc. However, the predictions of neural networks themselves contain a degree of uncertainty that must always be taken into account before any decision is made. This is why many researchers have focused on developing different ways to quantify the uncertainty of neural network predictions. Some of these methods are based on generating prediction intervals (PI) via neural networks for the requested target values. The SEF (Shifting the Error Function) method presented in this paper is a new method that belongs to this category of methods. The proposed approach involves training a single neural network three times, thus generating an estimate along with the corresponding upper and lower bounds for a given problem. A pivotal aspect of the method is the calculation of a parameter from the initial network's estimates, which is then integrated into the loss functions of the other two networks. This innovative process effectively produces PIs, resulting in a robust and efficient technique for uncertainty quantification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, a comparison in terms of successful PI generation between the SEF, PI3NN and PIVEN methods was made using two synthetic datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probability estimation of tree topologies is one of the fundamental tasks in phylogenetic inference. The recently proposed subsplit Bayesian networks (SBNs) provide a powerful probabilistic graphical model for tree topology probability estimation by properly leveraging the hierarchical structure of phylogenetic trees. However, the expectation maximization (EM) method currently used for learning SBN parameters does not scale up to large data sets. In this paper, we introduce several computationally efficient methods for training SBNs and show that variance reduction could be the key for better performance. Furthermore, we also introduce the variance reduction technique to improve the optimization of SBN parameters for variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI). Extensive synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform previous baseline methods on the tasks of tree topology probability estimation as well as Bayesian phylogenetic inference using SBNs.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Learning Markov Random Fields from Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important task in high-dimensional statistics is learning the parameters or dependency structure of an undirected graphical model, or Markov random field (MRF). Much of the prior work on this problem assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the MRF distribution and state-of-the-art algorithms succeed using $n^{\Theta(k)}$ runtime, where $n$ is the dimension and $k$ is the order of the interactions. However, well-known reductions from the sparse parity with noise problem imply that given i.i.d. samples from a sparse, order-$k$ MRF, any learning algorithm likely requires $n^{\Omega(k)}$ time, impeding the potential for significant computational improvements. In this work, we demonstrate that these fundamental barriers for learning MRFs can surprisingly be completely circumvented when learning from natural, dynamical samples. We show that in bounded-degree MRFs, the dependency structure and parameters can be recovered using a trajectory of Glauber dynamics of length $O(n \log n)$ with runtime $O(n^2 \log n)$. The implicit constants depend only on the degree and non-degeneracy parameters of the model, but not the dimension $n$. In particular, learning MRFs from dynamics is $\textit{provably computationally easier}$ than learning from i.i.d. samples under standard hardness assumptions.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design the first recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. The previously best-known rate of convergence in MSE was $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$, achieved by jackknifed estimators, which also do not enjoy these other desirable properties. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.
  We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.</description>

      <title>Breaking Neural Network Scaling Laws with Modularity</title>

Abstract: Modular neural networks outperform nonmodular neural networks on tasks ranging from visual question answering to robotics. These performance improvements are thought to be due to modular networks' superior ability to model the compositional and combinatorial structure of real-world problems. However, a theoretical explanation of how modularity improves generalizability, and how to leverage task modularity while training networks remains elusive. Using recent theoretical progress in explaining neural network generalization, we investigate how the amount of training data required to generalize on a task varies with the intrinsic dimensionality of a task's input. We show theoretically that when applied to modularly structured tasks, while nonmodular networks require an exponential number of samples with task dimensionality, modular networks' sample complexity is independent of task dimensionality: modular networks can generalize in high dimensions. We then develop a novel learning rule for modular networks to exploit this advantage and empirically show the improved generalization of the rule, both in- and out-of-distribution, on high-dimensional, modular tasks.</description>

      <title>Unified Neural Network Scaling Laws and Scale-time Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As neural networks continue to grow in size but datasets might not, it is vital to understand how much performance improvement can be expected: is it more important to scale network size or data volume? Thus, neural network scaling laws, which characterize how test error varies with network size and data volume, have become increasingly important. However, existing scaling laws are often applicable only in limited regimes and often do not incorporate or predict well-known phenomena such as double descent. Here, we present a novel theoretical characterization of how three factors -- model size, training time, and data volume -- interact to determine the performance of deep neural networks. We first establish a theoretical and empirical equivalence between scaling the size of a neural network and increasing its training time proportionally. Scale-time equivalence challenges the current practice, wherein large models are trained for small durations, and suggests that smaller models trained over extended periods could match their efficacy. It also leads to a novel method for predicting the performance of large-scale networks from small-scale networks trained for extended epochs, and vice versa. We next combine scale-time equivalence with a linear model analysis of double descent to obtain a unified theoretical scaling law, which we confirm with experiments across vision benchmarks and network architectures. These laws explain several previously unexplained phenomena: reduced data requirements for generalization in larger models, heightened sensitivity to label noise in overparameterized models, and instances where increasing model scale does not necessarily enhance performance. Our findings hold significant implications for the practical deployment of neural networks, offering a more accessible and efficient path to training and fine-tuning large models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary human choice feedback is widely used in interactive preference learning for its simplicity, but it provides limited information about preference strength. To overcome this limitation, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. Our work integrates the EZ-diffusion model, which jointly models human choices and response times, into preference-based linear bandits. We introduce a computationally efficient utility estimator that reformulates the utility estimation problem using both choices and response times as a linear regression problem. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators reveal that for queries with strong preferences ("easy" queries), choices alone provide limited information, while response times offer valuable complementary information about preference strength. As a result, incorporating response times makes easy queries more useful. We demonstrate this advantage in the fixed-budget best-arm identification problem, with simulations based on three real-world datasets, consistently showing accelerated learning when response times are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier.</description>

      <title>Canonical-Correlation-Based Fast Feature Selection for Structural Health Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection refers to the process of selecting useful features for machine learning tasks, and it is also a key step for structural health monitoring (SHM). This paper proposes a fast feature selection algorithm by efficiently computing the sum of squared canonical correlation coefficients between monitored features and target variables of interest in greedy search. The proposed algorithm is applied to both synthetic and real datasets to illustrate its advantages in terms of computational speed, general classification and regression tasks, as well as damage-sensitive feature selection tasks. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated under varying environmental conditions and on an edge computing device to investigate its applicability in real-world SHM scenarios. The results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully select useful features with extraordinarily fast computational speed, which implies that the proposed algorithm has great potential where features need to be selected and updated online frequently, or where devices have limited computing capability.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Topology Learning from Matrix-valued Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus is on the statistical analysis of matrix-valued time series, where data is collected over a network of sensors, typically at spatial locations, over time. Each sensor records a vector of features at each time point, creating a vectorial time series for each sensor. The goal is to identify the dependency structure among these sensors and represent it with a graph. When only one feature per sensor is observed, vector auto-regressive (VAR) models are commonly used to infer Granger causality, resulting in a causal graph. The first contribution extends VAR models to matrix-variate models for the purpose of graph learning. Additionally, two online procedures are proposed for both low and high dimensions, enabling rapid updates of coefficient estimates as new samples arrive. In the high-dimensional setting, a novel Lasso-type approach is introduced, and homotopy algorithms are developed for online learning. An adaptive tuning procedure for the regularization parameter is also provided. Given that the application of auto-regressive models to data typically requires detrending, which is not feasible in an online context, the proposed AR models are augmented by incorporating trend as an additional parameter, with a particular focus on periodic trends. The online algorithms are adapted to these augmented data models, allowing for simultaneous learning of the graph and trend from streaming samples. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Sensitivity under Probabilistic Error Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07831v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), have emerged as pivotal instruments in machine learning and signal processing for processing graph-structured data. This paper proposes an analysis framework to investigate the sensitivity of GCNNs to probabilistic graph perturbations, directly impacting the graph shift operator (GSO). Our study establishes tight expected GSO error bounds, which are explicitly linked to the error model parameters, and reveals a linear relationship between GSO perturbations and the resulting output differences at each layer of GCNNs. This linearity demonstrates that a single-layer GCNN maintains stability under graph edge perturbations, provided that the GSO errors remain bounded, regardless of the perturbation scale. For multilayer GCNNs, the dependency of system's output difference on GSO perturbations is shown to be a recursion of linearity. Finally, we exemplify the framework with the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) and Simple Graph Convolution Network (SGCN). Experiments validate our theoretical derivations and the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Know, Grow, and Protect Net Worth: Using ML for Asset Protection by Preventing Overdraft Fees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a customer overdraws their bank account and their balance is negative they are assessed an overdraft fee. Americans pay approximately \$15 billion in unnecessary overdraft fees a year, often in \$35 increments; users of the Mint personal finance app pay approximately \$250 million in fees a year in particular. These overdraft fees are an excessive financial burden and lead to cascading overdraft fees trapping customers in financial hardship. To address this problem, we have created an ML-driven overdraft early warning system (ODEWS) that assesses a customer's risk of overdrafting within the next week using their banking and transaction data in the Mint app. At-risk customers are sent an alert so they can take steps to avoid the fee, ultimately changing their behavior and financial habits. The system deployed resulted in a \$3 million savings in overdraft fees for Mint customers compared to a control group. Moreover, the methodology outlined here is part of a greater effort to provide ML-driven personalized financial advice to help our members know, grow, and protect their net worth, ultimately, achieving their financial goals.</description>

      <title>CA-PCA: Manifold Dimension Estimation, Adapted for Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of algorithms in the analysis of high-dimensional data is often attributed to the manifold hypothesis, which supposes that this data lie on or near a manifold of much lower dimension. It is often useful to determine or estimate the dimension of this manifold before performing dimension reduction, for instance. Existing methods for dimension estimation are calibrated using a flat unit ball. In this paper, we develop CA-PCA, a version of local PCA based instead on a calibration of a quadratic embedding, acknowledging the curvature of the underlying manifold. Numerous careful experiments show that this adaptation improves the estimator in a wide range of settings.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Approach to the Parameter Estimation Problem for One-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We derive theoretical guarantees and illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Spatial Autoregressive Models with Application to U.S. Presidential Election Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is important to incorporate spatial geographic information into U.S. presidential election analysis, especially for swing states. The state-level analysis also faces significant challenges of limited spatial data availability. To address the challenges of spatial dependence and small sample sizes in predicting U.S. presidential election results using spatially dependent data, we propose a novel transfer learning framework within the SAR model, called as tranSAR. Classical SAR model estimation often loses accuracy with small target data samples. Our framework enhances estimation and prediction by leveraging information from similar source data. We introduce a two-stage algorithm, consisting of a transferring stage and a debiasing stage, to estimate parameters and establish theoretical convergence rates for the estimators. Additionally, if the informative source data are unknown, we propose a transferable source detection algorithm using spatial residual bootstrap to maintain spatial dependence and derive its detection consistency. Simulation studies show our algorithm substantially improves the classical two-stage least squares estimator. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in predicting outcomes in U.S. presidential swing states, where it outperforms traditional methods. In addition, our tranSAR model predicts that the Democratic party will win the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</description>

Abstract: Empirical studies suggest that machine learning models often rely on features, such as the background, that may be spuriously correlated with the label only during training time, resulting in poor accuracy during test-time. In this work, we identify the fundamental factors that give rise to this behavior, by explaining why models fail this way {\em even} in easy-to-learn tasks where one would expect these models to succeed. In particular, through a theoretical study of gradient-descent-trained linear classifiers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature, and another, statistical in nature. Finally, we construct natural modifications of image classification datasets to understand when these failure modes can arise in practice. We also design experiments to isolate the two failure modes when training modern neural networks on these datasets.</description>

      <title>Path Development Network with Finite-dimensional Lie Group Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signature, lying at the heart of rough path theory, is a central tool for analysing controlled differential equations driven by irregular paths. Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional.
  We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues.
  Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</description>

      <title>Estimation and inference for the Wasserstein distance between mixing measures in topic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance between mixing measures has come to occupy a central place in the statistical analysis of mixture models. This work proposes a new canonical interpretation of this distance and provides tools to perform inference on the Wasserstein distance between mixing measures in topic models. We consider the general setting of an identifiable mixture model consisting of mixtures of distributions from a set $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with an arbitrary metric $d$, and show that the Wasserstein distance between mixing measures is uniquely characterized as the most discriminative convex extension of the metric $d$ to the set of mixtures of elements of $\mathcal{A}$. The Wasserstein distance between mixing measures has been widely used in the study of such models, but without axiomatic justification. Our results establish this metric to be a canonical choice. Specializing our results to topic models, we consider estimation and inference of this distance. Though upper bounds for its estimation have been recently established elsewhere, we prove the first minimax lower bounds for the estimation of the Wasserstein distance in topic models. We also establish fully data-driven inferential tools for the Wasserstein distance in the topic model context. Our results apply to potentially sparse mixtures of high-dimensional discrete probability distributions. These results allow us to obtain the first asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the Wasserstein distance in topic models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound with an Application to Covariance Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new performance bound for estimation problems where the parameter to estimate lies in a Riemannian manifold (a smooth manifold endowed with a Riemannian metric) and follows a given prior distribution. In this setup, the chosen Riemannian metric induces a geometry for the parameter manifold, as well as an intrinsic notion of the estimation error measure. Performance bound for such error measure were previously obtained in the non-Bayesian case (when the unknown parameter is assumed to deterministic), and referred to as \textit{intrinsic} Cram\'er-Rao bound. The presented result then appears either as: \textit{a}) an extension of the intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao bound to the Bayesian estimation framework; \textit{b}) a generalization of the Van-Trees inequality (Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound) that accounts for the aforementioned geometric structures. In a second part, we leverage this formalism to study the problem of covariance matrix estimation when the data follow a Gaussian distribution, and whose covariance matrix is drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution. Performance bounds for this problem are obtained for both the mean squared error (Euclidean metric) and the natural Riemannian distance for Hermitian positive definite matrices (affine invariant metric). Numerical simulation illustrate that assessing the error with the affine invariant metric is revealing of interesting properties of the maximum a posteriori and minimum mean square error estimator, which are not observed when using the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use these algorithms to approximate high-dimensional and non-linear nuisance functions of the confounders and double machine learning (DML) to make inferences about the effects of policy interventions from panel data. We propose new estimators by extending correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimation for linear models to an extension of Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model to static panel data models with individual fixed effects and unspecified non-linear confounding effects. We provide an illustrative example of DML for observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on voting behaviour in the UK.</description>

      <title>Rolling Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been increasingly applied to temporal data such as video, fluid mechanics simulations, or climate data. These methods generally treat subsequent frames equally regarding the amount of noise in the diffusion process. This paper explores Rolling Diffusion: a new approach that uses a sliding window denoising process. It ensures that the diffusion process progressively corrupts through time by assigning more noise to frames that appear later in a sequence, reflecting greater uncertainty about the future as the generation process unfolds. Empirically, we show that when the temporal dynamics are complex, Rolling Diffusion is superior to standard diffusion. In particular, this result is demonstrated in a video prediction task using the Kinetics-600 video dataset and in a chaotic fluid dynamics forecasting experiment.</description>

      <title>Injecting Undetectable Backdoors in Obfuscated Neural Networks and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As ML models become increasingly complex and integral to high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, they also become more susceptible to sophisticated adversarial attacks. We investigate the threat posed by undetectable backdoors, as defined in Goldwasser et al. (FOCS '22), in models developed by insidious external expert firms. When such backdoors exist, they allow the designer of the model to sell information on how to slightly perturb their input to change the outcome of the model.
  We develop a general strategy to plant backdoors to obfuscated neural networks, that satisfy the security properties of the celebrated notion of indistinguishability obfuscation. Applying obfuscation before releasing neural networks is a strategy that is well motivated to protect sensitive information of the external expert firm. Our method to plant backdoors ensures that even if the weights and architecture of the obfuscated model are accessible, the existence of the backdoor is still undetectable.
  Finally, we introduce the notion of undetectable backdoors to language models and extend our neural network backdoor attacks to such models based on the existence of steganographic functions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is often the first step in statistical modeling or prediction of multivariate spatial data. However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</description>

      <title>Accurate deep learning-based filtering for chaotic dynamics by identifying instabilities without an ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ability to discover data assimilation (DA) schemes meant for chaotic dynamics with deep learning. The focus is on learning the analysis step of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a simple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be known. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display spatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist. The accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that of the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter, and is far better than that of variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while propagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the reason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We diagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical perturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast state alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This reveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic theorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Pre-processing and Compression: Understanding Hidden Representation Refinement Across Imaging Domains via Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</description>

      <title>Solving Oscillator Ordinary Differential Equations via Soft-constrained Physics-informed Neural Network with Small Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and traditional numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations (DEs) through literature investigation and experimental validation. We focused on the soft-constrained PINN approach and formalized its mathematical framework and computational flow for solving Ordinary DEs and Partial DEs (ODEs/PDEs). The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</description>

      <title>Latent-EnSF: A Latent Ensemble Score Filter for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation with Sparse Observation Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling and prediction of complex physical systems often rely on data assimilation techniques to correct errors inherent in model simulations. Traditional methods like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants as well as the recently developed Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) face significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear Bayesian filtering problems with sparse observations, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data assimilation method, Latent-EnSF, which leverages EnSF with efficient and consistent latent representations of the full states and sparse observations to address the joint challenges of high dimensionlity in states and high sparsity in observations for nonlinear Bayesian filtering. We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.</description>

      <title>Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness.
