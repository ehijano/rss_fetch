      <title>The White Dwarf Initial-Final Mass Relation from Open Clusters in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) links a star's birth mass to the mass of its white dwarf (WD) remnant, providing key constraints on stellar evolution. Open clusters offer the most straightforward way to empirically determine the IFMR, as their well-defined ages allow for direct progenitor lifetime estimates. We construct the most comprehensive open cluster WD IFMR to date by combining new spectroscopy of 22 WDs with an extensive literature review of WDs with strong cluster associations. To minimize systematics, we restrict our analysis to spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) WDs consistent with single-stellar origins. We separately analyze a subset with reliable Gaia-based astrometric membership assessments, as well as a full sample that adds WDs with strong cluster associations whose membership cannot be reliably assessed with Gaia. The Gaia-based sample includes 69 spectroscopically confirmed DA WDs, more than doubling the sample size of previous Gaia-based open cluster IFMRs. The full sample, which includes 53 additional literature WDs, increases the total number of cluster WDs by over $50\%$ relative to earlier works. We provide functional forms for both the Gaia-based and full-sample IFMRs. The Gaia-based result useful for $M_i \geq 2.67\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is $$M_f = \left[0.179 - 0.100 H(M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) \right ] \times (M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)+0.628\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$$ where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. Comparing our IFMR to recent literature, we identify significant deviations from best-fit IFMRs derived from both Gaia-based volume limited samples of field WDs and double WD binaries, with the largest discrepancy occurring for initial masses of about $5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Overview of Long-Lived Active Regions Observed Across Multiple Carrington Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of solar active regions (ARs) is of central importance to a range of fundamental science, as well as the practical applications of space weather. Active region emergence and life cycles are two areas of particular interest, yet the lack of consistent full-Sun observations has made long-term studies of active regions difficult. Here, we present results from a study to identify and characterize long-lived active regions (LLARs), defined as those which were observed during at least two consecutive Carrington rotations and which did not undergo significant successive flux emergence once the decay phase began. Such active regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and 2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number. This implies that LLARs are produced by the same basic driving processes as regular ARs. LLAR areas tend to be significantly larger and contain more magnetic flux compared to other ARs, but the two categories have similar magnetic complexity distributions. The most striking result, however, is that LLARs are 3-6 times more likely than other ARs to be the source of a solar flare of GOES class C or greater. This highlights the importance of studying what makes a LLAR and how to identify them at emergence with a view towards improved space weather forecasting. The further implications of these findings for AR heating spatial and temporal patterns will be explored in an upcoming study.</description>

      <title>Reconnection nanojets associated with a prominence eruption observed with Solar Orbiter/EUI-HRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a proposed mechanism for nanojets associated with coronal heating. We investigate the characteristics of reconnection-driven nanojets just before and during a prominence eruption using the High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter during its perihelion on September 30, 2024. Extreme UV (EUV) images at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution from \hrieuv were analysed. The dimensions and propagation speeds of nanojets were estimated and used to estimate the kinetic energies. Nanojet activity was compared with GOES X-ray flux to assess its relation to flare evolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution in the EUV was found to be essential to fully capture the properties and numbers of reconnection nanojets. Approximately 120 nanojets were detected during the eruption, with 40 analysed in detail. Nanojets exhibited lengths of $200 - 5000$~km, widths of $200 - 500$~km and durations of $2-12$~s. Instant velocities ranged from 150 km~s$^{-1}- 600~$km~s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energies reaching $1.56\times10^{27}$~erg. These nanojets are faster, longer, more energetic and more numerous compared to previous studies. We also find clear signatures of acceleration and deceleration, reflecting magnetic tension release and reach of new equilibria. Reconnection events during the eruption were found to be more frequent and energetically intense. Pre-flare nanojet clustering indicates small-scale reconnection may precede large eruptive activity. These results suggest that nanojets also occur in fully ionised coronal plasma, playing a role in both quiescent and eruptive solar activity.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Gaseous Debris Disks in DESI Early Data Release White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting gaseous debris disks around white dwarfs offers a unique window into the ultimate fate of planetary systems and the composition of accreted planetary material. Here we present a systematic search for such disks through the Ca II infrared triplet using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. From a parent sample of 2706 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs, we identify 22 candidate systems showing tentative emission-line features, which corresponds to a raw occurrence rate of 0.81%, more than ten times higher than previous estimates. The detected emission lines are predominantly weak and require confirmation by follow-up observations. Three of these candidates also exhibit infrared excess in WISE photometry, suggesting a possible coexistence of gas and dust. However, the high candidate rate indicates that most are likely false positives due to telluric residuals or unresolved binaries. This work demonstrates the potential of DESI spectra for blind searches of rare circumstellar phenomena. The recently released DESI DR1, with its substantially larger spectroscopic sample, will enable searches for more gaseous disks and provide better insights into their occurrence and nature.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physical and Chemical Characteristics of an Extremely Early Class 0 Protostar in G204.4-11.3A2-NE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25230v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.</description>

      <title>Modeling multiphase plasma in the corona: prominences and rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review major achievements in our understanding of multiphase coronal plasma, where cool-dense and hot-tenuous matter coexists, brought about by advances in modeling and theory, inspired by observations. We give an overview of models that self-consistently form solar (or stellar) prominences and filaments, or (postflare) coronal rain, and clarify how these different phenomena share a common physical origin, relating radiative losses and coronal heating. While we do not fully understand the coronal heating, multi-dimensional models of solar prominence and rain formation demonstrate how thermal instability triggers condensations, and how their morphology may reveal aspects of the applied heating at play. We emphasize how the many pathways to linear instability due to combined ingredients of heat-loss, gravity, flows, and magnetic topologies are all involved in the resulting nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics. We provide some challenges to future model efforts, especially concerning prominence fine structure, internal dynamics, and their overall lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Unusual periodic modulation in the radio emission of the methane dwarf binary WISEP J101905.63+652954.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs display Jupiter-like auroral phenomena, such as rotationally modulated electron cyclotron maser radio emission. Radio observations of cyclotron maser emission can be used to measure their magnetic field strength, topology, and to deduce the presence of magnetically interacting exoplanets. Observations of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral types T and Y) are especially intriguing, as their magnetospheric phenomena could closely resemble those of gas-giant exoplanets. Here we report observations made over ten epochs, amounting to 44 hours, of WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 (J1019+65 hereinafter) using the LOFAR telescope between 120 and 168 MHz. J1019+65 is a methane dwarf binary (T5.5+T7) whose radio emission was originally detected in a single-epoch LOFAR observation to be highly circular polarised and rotationally modulated at $\approx 3$h. Unexpectedly, our long-term monitoring reveals an additional periodic signature at $\approx 0.787$h. We consider several explanations for the second period and suggest that it could be the rotationally modulated emission of the second brown dwarf in the binary, although follow-up infrared observations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, the data also allow us to statistically estimate the duty cycle and observed radio-loud fraction of the 120-168\,MHz cyclotron emission from methane dwarfs to be $\langle D \rangle = 0.030^{+0.034}_{-0.030}$ and $F^{'}_{\rm radio} = 0.088^{+0.168}_{-0.088}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Coronal electron density: Insights from radio and in situ observations, and EUHFORIA modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the coronal electron density at different distances from the Sun strongly influences the physical processes in the solar corona and is therefore a very important topic in solar physics. Most methods, including radio observations, used for estimating coronal electron density were not fully validated due to the absence of in situ observations closer to the Sun. Consequently, space weather forecasting models that simulate coronal density lacked proper validation. Newly available PSP in situ observations at distances close to the Sun provide an opportunity to study plasma properties near the Sun and to compare observational and modeling results. This work studies type III bursts, estimates their propagation path, and validates coronal electron density obtained from radio, in situ observations, and modeling with EUHFORIA. Type III bursts observed during the second PSP perihelion are analyzed using radio triangulation and modeling. We determine 3D positions of radio sources and use EUHFORIA to estimate electron densities at various locations. The electron densities derived from radio observations and EUHFORIA modeling are inter-validated with in situ PSP measurements. We studied 11 type III bursts during the second PSP perihelion, with radio triangulation showing propagation paths southward from the solar ecliptic plane. Radio source sizes ranged from 0.5 to 40 deg (0.5 to 25 Rs) with no clear frequency dependence, indicating that scattering of radio waves was not very significant. Comparison of electron densities from radio triangulation, PSP data, and EUHFORIA modeling showed a large range of values, influenced by different propagation paths and model limitations. Despite these variations, EUHFORIA identified high-density regions along type III burst paths.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Exploring the cosmic scatter among ten r-process sites with stellar abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which produces about half of the elements heavier than iron, remains uncertain. The oldest, most metal-poor stars preserve the chemical signatures of early nucleosynthesis events and can reveal the nature of the r-process sites. We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of ten r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars that show strong enrichment in r-process elements with minimal contamination from other nucleosynthetic sources. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we examined over 1400 absorption lines per star through equivalent width measurements and spectral synthesis under one-dimensional LTE assumptions with the MOOG radiative transfer code. Abundances for 54 chemical species were derived, including 29 neutron-capture elements spanning the full r-process pattern. We quantified the cosmic scatter of elemental ratios relative to Zr (light) and Eu (heavy) and found remarkably small dispersions for the rare-earth and third-peak elements, {\sigma}[La/Eu] = 0.08 dex and {\sigma}[Os/Eu] = 0.11 dex, while the light-to-heavy ratio shows slightly larger variation, {\sigma}[Zr/Eu] = 0.18 dex. A kinematic study indicates that the stars likely originated from ten distinct progenitor systems, allowing us to probe the intrinsic variation between independent r-process events. These results imply that the main r-process operates under highly uniform conditions across diverse astrophysical sites.</description>

      <title>Solar photospheric velocities measured in space: a comparison between SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.94 and a correlation of 90%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 10$\pm$12 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on the Sun are properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Relationship between Magnetic Anisotropy and Mode Composition in Low-$\beta$ Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfv\'en and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfv\'enic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.</description>

      <title>Observing Orbital Decay in the Ultracompact Hot Subdwarf Binary System ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracompact Galactic binary systems (UCBs) emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The emission of GWs is causing these systems to lose angular momentum, which is detectable by observing an orbital period decay. ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5 (ZTFJ2130) is an UCB with a period of 39.3401(1) minutes consisting of a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and a white dwarf companion. We attempt to measure the orbital decay rate $\dot{P}$ caused by GW emission of ZTFJ2130 and predict the expected GW signal for LISA. High-speed photometry was conducted using the FLI Kepler KL4040FI CMOS camera, mounted to the 1.2-meter Oskar L\"uhning telescope at the Hamburg Observatory as well as the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera at the 1.23-meter telescope at CAHA in Spain. ZTFJ2130 was observed on six nights between August 2024 and September 2025. The obtained lightcurves combined with previous high-cadence observations were used to conduct an O-C timing analysis. Additionally, we employed the LISA data analysis tool ldasoft to model the expected GW data. We measure a period change of $(-1.97\pm0.05)\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{ss^{-1}}$. Assuming only GW emission, this result was used to calculate a chirp mass of $(0.408\pm0.006)\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. From ldasoft we predict that LISA will be able to measure the chirp mass with an uncertainty of 5%. We measure $\dot{P}$ with an uncertainty of only 2% and show that modern (q)CMOS detectors are well suited to provide precise timing measurements, enabling the measurement of the orbital decay of UCBs with high precision with modest size telescopes. The derived orbital decay is fully consistent with predictions from spectral and lightcurve modeling. We show that future observations with LISA can potentially provide a deviation from only gravitational wave effects, e.g. due to accretion, if the effect is sufficiently large.</description>

Abstract: While the 14N(p,g)15O reaction plays a key role in the hydrogen-burning processes in various stellar conditions, its reaction rate is not known with sufficient precision. Therefore, the first scientific project at the recently launched Bellotti Ion Beam Facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso was the measurement of the 14N(p,g)15O reaction cross section in the proton energy range between 250 and 1500 keV. In this paper, the experimental techniques are summarized with special emphasis on the description of solid state nitrogen target production and characterization. The first results of the reaction yield measured at 55 deg detection angle are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chart of nuclei could be enlarged with a branch describing neutron stars that are huge nuclei of a few solar masses held together by
  gravity force and sustained by the pressure due to the degenerate Fermi sea. We contend in this manuscript that yet another branch
  could be added: objects with a large weak charge, with masses around $10^{-3}$ solar masses and having radii of a few meters, very compact,
  only slightly larger than their Schwarzchild radius, and sustained by the pressure generated by the weak force due to $Z$ exchange.
  This interaction, insignificant in normal neutron stars, could become dominant when ultrahigh densities are reached due to the action of gravity
  and lead to stable configurations if the appropriate conditions are met. They would constitute a physical realization of the equation of state
  proposed by Zeldovich some decades ago.</description>

      <title>From Underground Oceans to Continents: A Glimpse into the Water Inventory on Rocky Planets using Host Star Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of surface water is thought to be critical for a planet's climate stability and thus habitability. However, the probability that a rocky planet may exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple factors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior composition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior composition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be impacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first exploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet radius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky planets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and GALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content) significantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for surface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1 M$_\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may reduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on seafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be flooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like topographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form high-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we show that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water inventory of rocky planets.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VIII. SOPHIE radial velocities reveal an eccentric, circumbinary brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $&lt; 3 \,\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\rm b}\,\sin i_{\rm b} = 20.9 \,\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\,\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\rm b}&lt; 26.3 \,\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\rm A} = 1.51\,\rm M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm B} = 0.46\,\rm M_\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\,\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs : Understanding the wavelength dependence of radial velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.</description>

      <title>Engulfment of Eccentric Planets by Giant Stars: Hydrodynamics and Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that planetary engulfment by a giant star may produce radiation that resembles subluminous red novae. We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric $5 \,M_J$ giant planet and its $1\,M_\odot$ red-giant host star. The planet's pericenter is initially $60\%$ of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhances the stellar luminosity by several orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cools to about $10^4\,\rm{K}$. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation and spin-orbit alignment due to the precessional instability in convection zones in rotating giant planets and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal dissipation in star-planet systems occurs through various mechanisms, including the precessional instability. This is an instability of laminar flows (``Poincar\'{e} flows") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate, spin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in convective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincar\'{e} number" $\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincar\'e number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.</description>

      <title>Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray Emission in AU Mic Flares: A Minor Contributor to Planetary Atmospheric Escape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar flares are potent drivers of atmospheric evolution on orbiting exoplanets, primarily through extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (XUV) irradiation. However, the contribution of hard X-rays (HXR; 3--20 keV)-which penetrate deeper into planetary atmospheres-to mass loss and particle acceleration has remained poorly understood. To quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we conducted quasi-simultaneous observations of the active M-dwarf AU Mic using NuSTAR, Swift, and the Einstein Probe. Our analysis detected two major flares, and we performed an empirical check by deriving a quiescent-phase soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3--3 keV)-HXR relation and then applying it to the flares. By combining this with the quiescent coronal SXR-EUV relations conversion of J. Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011), we computed the total high-energy flux (EUV + SXR + HXR) and assessed the relative role of HXR in atmospheric escape. We find that HXR accounts for only a few percent of the total radiative energy budget during both quiescent and flaring states. While a high-energy spectral tail is detected in the second flare, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a dominant chromospheric-evaporation signature, indicating that the flare energetics are primarily thermal.</description>

Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the requirements, concepts, simulations, implementation, and calibration of two dual Fabry-Perot based imaging spectropolarimeters, CRISP and CHROMIS, at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, and CRISP2 that is under construction. These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a low-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the bandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the low-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from both etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need for folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than mirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a previous publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial alignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The telecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system parameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We also discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high performance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier publication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons with similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum filters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to enabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and processing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate the achievable image and data quality. We put forward a proposal for a similar conceptual design for the European Solar Telescope and conclude by discussing potential problems of the proposed approach to designs of this type. Some aspects of these FPI systems may be of interest also outside the solar community.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>
