      <title>Forecasting and decisions in the birth-death-suppression Markov model for wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As changing climates transform the landscape of wildfire management and suppression, agencies are faced with difficult resource allocation decisions. We analyze trade-offs in temporal resource allocation using a simple but robust Markov model of a wildfire under suppression: the birth-death-suppression process. Though the model is not spatial, its stochastic nature and rich temporal structure make it broadly applicable in describing the dynamic evolution of a fire including ignition, the effect of adverse conditions, and the effect of external suppression. With strong analytical and numerical control of the probabilities of outcomes, we construct classes of processes which analogize common wildfire suppression scenarios and determine aspects of optimal suppression allocations. We model problems which include resource management in changing conditions, the effect of resource mobilization delay, and allocation under uncertainty about future events. Our results are consistent with modern resource management and suppression practices in wildland fire.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's effects with aperiodic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effectiveness of employing archetypal aperiodic sequencing -- namely Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Saphiro -- on the Parrondian effect. From a capital gain perspective, our results show that these series do yield a Parrondo's Paradox with the Thue-Morse based strategy outperforming not only the other two aperiodic strategies but benchmark Parrondian games with random and periodical ($AABBAABB\ldots$) switching as well. The least performing of the three aperiodic strategies is the Rudin-Shapiro. To elucidate the underlying causes of these results, we analyze the cross-correlation between the capital generated by the switching protocols and that of the isolated losing games. This analysis reveals that a pronounced anti-correlation (below -0.95) with both isolated games is typically required to achieve a robust manifestation of Parrondo's effect. We also study the influence of the sequencing on the capital using the lacunarity and persistence measures. In general, we observe that the switching protocols tend to become less performing in terms of the capital as one increases the persistence and thus approaches the features of an isolated losing game. For the (log-)lacunarity, a property related to heterogeneity, we notice that for small persistence (less than 0.5) the performance increases with the lacunarity with a maximum around 0.4. In respect of this, our work shows that the optimisation of a switching protocol is strongly dependent on a fine tune between persistence and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Geospatial analysis of toponyms in geotagged social media posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Place names, or toponyms, play an integral role in human representation and communication of geographic space. In particular, how people relate each toponym with particular locations in geographic space should be indicative of their spatial perception. Here, we make use of an extensive dataset of georeferenced social media posts, retreived from Twitter, to perform a statistical analysis of the geographic distribution of toponyms and uncover the relationship between toponyms and geographic space. We show that the occurrence of toponyms is characterized by spatial inhomogeneity, giving rise to patterns that are distinct from the distribution of common nouns. Using simple models, we quantify the spatial specificity of toponym distributions and identify their core-periphery structures. In particular, we find that toponyms are used with a probability that decays as a power law with distance from the geographic center of their occurrence. Our findings highlight the potential of social media data to explore linguistic patterns in geographic space, paving the way for comprehensive analyses of human spatial representations.</description>

      <title>CLOVE: Travelling Salesman's approach to hyperbolic embeddings of complex networks with communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The embedding of complex networks into metric spaces has become a research topic of high interest with a wide variety of proposed methods. Low dimensional hyperbolic spaces offer a natural co-domain for embeddings allowing a roughly uniform spatial distribution of the nodes even for scale-free networks and the efficient navigability and estimation of linking probabilities. According to recent results, the communities of a complex network after optimization can be naturally mapped into well-defined angular sectors of the hyperbolic space. Here we introduce CLOVE, an embedding method exploiting this property based on iterative arrangement of the communities in a hierarchical manner, down to individual nodes. A crucial step in the process is finding the optimal angular order of the communities at a given level of the hierarchy, which is solved based on the Travelling Salesman Problem. Since CLOVE outperforms most of the alternative methods regarding different embedding quality measures and is computationally very efficient, it can be very useful in related down-stream machine learning tasks such as AI based pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>Impact factors of astrophysics journals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors of 36 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>

      <title>Group Fairness in Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large conferences such as NeurIPS and AAAI serve as crossroads of various AI fields, since they attract submissions from a vast number of communities. However, in some cases, this has resulted in a poor reviewing experience for some communities, whose submissions get assigned to less qualified reviewers outside of their communities. An often-advocated solution is to break up any such large conference into smaller conferences, but this can lead to isolation of communities and harm interdisciplinary research. We tackle this challenge by introducing a notion of group fairness, called the core, which requires that every possible community (subset of researchers) to be treated in a way that prevents them from unilaterally benefiting by withdrawing from a large conference.
  We study a simple peer review model, prove that it always admits a reviewing assignment in the core, and design an efficient algorithm to find one such assignment. We use real data from CVPR and ICLR conferences to compare our algorithm to existing reviewing assignment algorithms on a number of metrics.</description>

      <title>The influence of coordinated behavior on toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the intricate landscape of social media, genuine content dissemination may be altered by a number of threats. Coordinated Behavior (CB), defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about their identity and intentions, emerges as a tactic to exploit or manipulate online discourse. This study delves into the relationship between CB and toxic conversation on X (formerly known as Twitter). Using a dataset of 11 million tweets from 1 million users preceding the 2019 UK general election, we show that users displaying CB typically disseminate less harmful content, irrespective of political affiliation. However, distinct toxicity patterns emerge among different coordinated cohorts. Compared to their non-CB counterparts, CB participants show marginally higher toxicity levels only when considering their original posts. We further show the effects of CB-driven toxic content on non-CB users, gauging its impact based on political leanings. Our findings suggest that CB only has a limited impact on the toxicity of digital discourse.</description>
