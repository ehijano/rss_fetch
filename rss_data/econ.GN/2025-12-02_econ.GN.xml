      <title>Layout de Cabine, Densidade de Assentos e Segmentacao de Passageiros no Transporte Aereo: Implicacoes para Precos, Receitas Auxiliares e Eficiencia</title>

Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and seat density in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure in order to select numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.</description>

      <title>Equitable Longevity Risk Sharing or, the raison d'\^etre for a First Nations Pension Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which groups with elevated mortality rates ex ante might opt out of guaranteed national pensions in favour of demographically aligned plans, which we label equitable longevity risk sharing (ELRiS) pools, even if this involves accepting some idiosyncratic risk. Technically, this paper develops a stochastic model of retirement income within an ELRiS structure that is calibrated to equate the discounted expected utility of a guaranteed national pension. The practical motivation for developing this alternative is that working members of First Nations peoples of Canada: (1) experience much higher mortality rates than average over their entire life cycle, and (2) some are actually allowed by current legislation to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). We then demonstrate that under reasonable economic preferences and parameters, a sub-group with a 10-year life expectancy gap relative to the population could attain equivalent lifetime utility by contributing a mere two-thirds to the plan, even if they were pooled with only 30 members. For a longevity gap of 20 years, such as between an Indigenous male versus a non-Indigenous female, the contribution rate falls to less than a third. The difference between the statutory and mandatory contribution rates to a guaranteed national pension and those needed within these self-sustaining pools is an implicit subsidy from Indigenous to non-Indigenous. From a policy perspective, this paper aspires to jump-start a conversation that sparks a change in a status quo, which is obviously unfair and inequitable.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Rewards in the Era of Intelligence-Driven Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of OECD Countries Based on Energy Trilemma Index: A Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes OECD countries in the context of the energy trilemma index and clusters countries with similar characteristics. In the study, the k-means clustering technique is used. The optimum number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method in combination with the Silhouette Index. Moreover, all results are visualized to enhance comprehensibility. The results show that countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, and Denmark are in the high energy trilemma group with index scores of 82.2, 82.3, 82.7, and 83.3, respectively. Countries in the high group have achieved a high level of balance between energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Australia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia are in the medium energy trilemma group with index scores of 76.4, 76.6, 77.1, 77.6, and 78.7, respectively. Countries in the medium group have made progress in balancing the dimensions of the energy trilemma but have not yet reached excellence. However, countries such as Mexico, T\"urkiye, Colombia, and Costa Rica are in the low energy trilemma group with index scores of 63.1, 64.1, 64.8, and 69.3, respectively. These low energy trilemma group countries face significant challenges in balancing energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability and need to make improvements in these areas.</description>

      <title>Public Ideological Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a novel summary measure of ideological polarization in the American public based on the joint distribution of survey responses. Intuitively, polarization is maximized when views are concentrated at opposing extremes with little mass in between and when opinions are highly correlated across many issues. Using this measure, I show that public polarization has been increasing for the past three decades and that these changes are mostly due to increases in general disagreement, not dimensional collapse. Furthermore, these increases are not explained by the diverging opinions of Democrats and Republicans, nor divergence of opinions across gender, geography, education, or any other demographic divide.</description>

      <title>Newsvendor Decisions under Stochastic and Strategic Uncertainties: Theory and Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital commerce platforms has amplified the strategic importance of coordinated pricing and inventory management decisions among competing retailers. Motivated by practices on leading e-commerce platforms, we analyze a sequential duopolistic newsvendor game where retailers first publicly set prices and subsequently make private inventory decisions under demand uncertainty. Our theory predicts that higher profit margins and demand uncertainty intensify price competition, while optimal inventory responses to demand uncertainty are shaped by profit margins. Laboratory evidence, however, reveals that participants are generally reluctant to compete on price, frequently coordinating on salient focal (reserve) prices, particularly in low-margin settings, and show little sensitivity to demand uncertainty in pricing. On the inventory side, participants' order quantities are largely insensitive to chosen prices and continue to exhibit well-documented Pull-to-Center biases. These findings reveal a disconnect between pricing and inventory decisions under competition and highlight the importance of accounting for persistent behavioral tendencies in retail operations.</description>

      <title>Global Banks' Spillovers to Emerging Markets: Macro to Micro Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how shocks to global banks' net worth transmit to Emerging Market Economies. Using the identification strategy of Ottonello and Song (2022), which isolates high-frequency surprises to banks' credit supply capacity, we show that positive shocks appreciate local currencies, lower external borrowing costs, increase capital flows to domestic banking sectors, and raise investment, credit, and real activity across EMEs. These effects are highly robust across specifications and samples. Using administrative credit-registry data from Uruguay, we find that better capitalized banks transmit global credit easing more strongly. At the firm level, responses are weaker for more leveraged firms, especially those with foreign-currency debt, short maturities, or collateral not priced to market.</description>

      <title>Banking system stability: A global analysis of cybercrime laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the role of cybercrime legislation around the world in shaping the stability of the banking system. We compile a novel dataset covering the enactment of cybercrime legislation in 132 developed and developing countries to empirically test this research question. We find that the enactment of cybercrime laws enhances the stability of the banking sector. This key finding holds across a comprehensive suite of robustness tests, including alternative measures of bank stability and model specifications. We document significant cross-sectional heterogeneity, with the effect being more pronounced in countries with heavier penalties for illegal cyber activities and legal frameworks that hold banks accountable for their cybersecurity practices. In addition, the positive impact is stronger in jurisdictions with greater international legal cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms. We further investigate two channels (i.e., funding liquidity and operational risk) through which cybercrime laws may influence bank stability. Our results indicate that these laws can significantly bolster bank stability by enhancing funding liquidity and mitigating operational risk. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of cybercrime legislation in fostering a secure and resilient banking environment. It offers new insights into how these laws contribute to bank stability on both individual and systemic levels.</description>

      <title>Virtual Observability in Sequential Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When players make sequential decisions that are unobservable to one another, their behavior can nonetheless be influenced by knowing who moves first. This sequential structure, often referred to as "virtual observability," suggests that timing alone can shape expectations and choices, even when no information is revealed. The original notion of virtual observability, however, is an equilibrium refinement based on the timing structure and has no bite in games with a unique equilibrium. In this paper, we experimentally examine whether timing still affects behavior in such games, using the Traveler's Dilemma and the Trust Game. We find that in the sequential Traveler's Dilemma without observability, first movers tend to behave closer to the equilibrium prediction than in the simultaneous version. In contrast, timing without observability has no effect on behavior in the Trust Game.</description>

      <title>Forging a Developed India: Growth Imperatives, Fiscal Sustainability, and Multilateral Partnerships for Viksit Bharat 2047</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the fiscal and macroeconomic strategies essential for transition of India to a high income economy by 2047, aligning with the vision of Viksit Bharat. A sustainable annual GDP growth rate of 7 to 8 percent is projected as necessary to achieve this milestone while maintaining fiscal prudence through a targeted deficit threshold below 3.5 percent of GDP. The study underscores the role of disciplined fiscal management in financing critical public investments in infrastructure, human capital development and technological innovation. Given constraints on domestic resource mobilization, the paper highlights the importance of multilateral financial institutions, including the World Bank, IMF and ADB, in expanding fiscal space in India through concessional financing, technical cooperation, and risk sharing mechanisms. Using econometric modeling and scenario analysis, the research identifies key policy interventions in infrastructure, healthcare, education and sustainable energy that can maximize growth while ensuring fiscal sustainability. Policy recommendations include enhancing tax buoyancy, rationalizing expenditure, optimizing public private partnerships and strengthening fiscal responsibility frameworks. The findings suggest that a calibrated approach to growth, prudent fiscal management and strategic international collaborations are critical to achieving long term economic aspirations of India.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Economic Freedom and Foreign Direct Investment Globally: Special Cases from Neglected Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the macroeconomic impact of economic freedom on foreign direct investments inflows in both global and regional panel analyses involving 156 countries through the period of 1995-2016. Unlike to prior literature, it includes often neglected nations such as Fragile and Conflict-Affected states, Sub-Saharan, Oceanian, and Post-Soviet countries. The paper finds a positive impact of economic freedom on FDI under fixed-effects model in global case where a unit change in economic freedom scales FDI inflows up to 1.15 units. More specifically, all 9 regions also refer to positive and significant impact of economic freedom on FDI. The highest impact is recorded in European countries, whereas the lowest ones are documented in Fragile-Conflict affected states, Sub-Saharan zone, and Oceanian countries.</description>

      <title>Phillips curve estimation during tranquil and recessionary periods: evidence from panel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical literature that covers Phillips Curve analysis during recessionary periods is notably scant. The Great Recession has rekindled a debate on the validity and stability of the Phillips Curve which is still ongoing. The basis for this debate is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without causing a drop in inflation. This paper carries out an empirical analysis for the classical expectation-augmented Phillips curve model across 41 countries from1980-2016 by distinguishing tranquil and recessionary periods separately. Based on the results of the research, the paper finds that dynamics of Phillips Curve changes during recessionary periods and the empirical relationship becomes no longer valid. These findings support the ongoing debate about the missing disinflation and collapse of the Phillips curve, but only during the recessionary periods. In the case of tranquil periods, the empirical relationship still seems to be valid. Moreover, the paper also observes that both backward-looking and forward-looking fractions of inflation gain weight and significance during recessionary periods. However, the paper remains indecisive about which exact fraction gains more weight and significance as the panel model does not incorporate these two fractions of inflation in a single hybrid framework simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Convergence to Utility Maximization and the Indifference Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask if participants in a choice experiment with repeated presentation of the same menus and no feedback provision: (i) exhibit overall behaviour that is consistent with ordinal and expected utility theory under *weak* preferences; (ii) become more consistent with the predictions of these theories under *strict* preferences.To answer these questions we designed and implemented a free-choice lab experiment with 15 distinct menus. Each menu contained two, three and four lotteries with three monetary outcomes, and was shown five times. Subjects could avoid/defer making active choices at a positive expected cost. Among our 308 subjects from the UK and Germany, significantly more were compatible with ordinal and expected utility maximization in their last 15 than in their first 15 identical decision problems. Around a quarter and a fifth of all subjects, moreover, were compatible with those modes *throughout* the experiment, with nearly half of these under weak preferences. Choice consistency is positively correlated with cognitive ability, and subjects who converged to utility-maximizing behaviour were more cognitively able than those who did not. We discuss potential implications of our study's novel set of findings.</description>

      <title>The Global Minimum Tax, Investment Incentives and Asymmetric Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the OECD's global minimum tax (GMT) in a formal model of tax competition between asymmetric countries. We consider both profit shifting and real responses of multinational enterprises, and highlight the role of the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE) in investment incentives and tax rate setting. The GMT reduces the true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the revenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run where tax rates are fixed, the GMT reduces the small country's revenue if profit shifting costs are low and increases it otherwise. In the long run where countries adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition pattern. We reveal that the minimum rate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate, countries will set tax rates below the minimum to boost capital investments and collect top-up taxes. Simulations show that a moderate GMT rate can raise both countries' revenues and the large country's welfare in the long run. However, it may reduce the small country's welfare if the welfare weight of private income is high.</description>

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without relying on new taxation or the creation of new jobs. In a Solow-Zeira task-automation economy with a CES aggregator $\sigma &lt; 1$, we introduce an AI capability parameter that scales the productivity of automatable tasks and obtain a tractable expression for the AI capability threshold -- the minimum productivity of AI relative to pre-AI automation required for a balanced transfer.
  Using current U.S. economic parameters, we find that even in the conservative scenario where no new tasks or jobs emerge, AI systems would only need to reach only 5-7 times today's automation productivity to fund an 11%-of-GDP UBI.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automation productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  These results therefore offer a rigorous benchmark for assessing when advancing AI capabilities might sustainably finance social transfers in an increasingly automated economy.</description>

      <title>The Geopolitical Determinants of Economic Growth, 1960-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04833v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes geopolitical relations as a first-order determinant of economic growth. We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral alignment by employing large language models to compile 373,020 geopolitical events across 193 countries from 1960 to 2024. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise timing and magnitude of geopolitical shifts. Exploiting within-country temporal variation with local projections, we find that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per capita by 10 percent over 20 years. These growth effects operate through multiple reinforcing channels, including domestic stability, investment, trade, and productivity. Over the sample period, geopolitical factors account for GDP variations ranging from -30 to +30 percent across countries.</description>

      <title>The AI Productivity Index (APEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>Government Transparency and Innovation: Evidence from Wireless Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does government transparency affect innovation? I evaluate the launch of a government database with detailed technical information on the universe of wireless-enabled products on the U.S. market (N 347 thousand). The results show the launch approximately doubled the use of new technologies in the following ten years, an indicator of follow-on innovation. The increase affected both products in the same and new product classes, suggesting novelty; waned over several years, potentially due to an increase in secrecy and patenting; and boosted foreign more than U.S. domestic competitors. These results highlight the importance of information for private sector innovation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gender Wage Inequality in Academia using Causal Inference Methods for Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational studies often present challenges for causal inference due to confounding and heterogeneity. In this paper, we illustrate how modern causal inference methods can be applied to large-scale academic salary data. Using records from 12,039 tenure-track faculty in the University of North Carolina system, linked with bibliometric indicators and institutional classifications, we estimate the causal effect of gender on faculty salaries. Our analysis combines propensity score matching with causal forests to adjust for rank, discipline, research productivity, and career experience. Results indicate that female faculty earn approximately 6% less than comparable male colleagues, with variation in the gap across career stages and levels of research productivity. This case study demonstrates how causal inference methods for observational data can provide insight into structural disparities in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Arrow--Debreu: A New Framework for Exchange, Time, and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium framework through the lens of effective trade, emphasizing the distinction between theoretical and realizable market interactions. We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM), where transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate supply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main properties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash equilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis extends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds and exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is shaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized negotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby call into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled via the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information limitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus offers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical general equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal consistency within a unified framework.</description>
