      <title>Geometric configuration of integrally closed Noetherian domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we completely describe the family of integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. We accomplish this result by classifying the Krull domains between these two polynomial rings. To this end, we first describe the DVRs of $\mathbb{Q}(X)$ lying over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ for some prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, by distinguishing them according to whether the extension of the residue fields is algebraic or transcendental. We unify the known descriptions of such valuations by considering ultrametric balls in $\mathbb{C}_p$, the completion of the algebraic closure of the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. We then study when the intersection $R$ of such DVRs with $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ is of finite character, so that $R$ is a Krull domain, and we finally compute the divisor class group of $R$. It turns out that such a ring is formed by those polynomials which simultaneously map a finite union of ultrametric balls of $\mathbb{C}_p$ to its valuation domain $\mathbb{O}_p$, as $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ ranges through the set of primes. By a result of Heinzer, the Krull domains of this class are precisely the integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. This novel approach provides a geometric understanding of this class of integrally closed domains. Furthermore, we also describe the UFDs between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$.</description>

      <title>Noetherianity for powers of algebraic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powers of a polynomial $\operatorname{GL}$-representation are topologically Noetherian under the action of $\operatorname{Sym} \times \operatorname{GL}$. We show that this result extends to powers of algebraic representations of the orthogonal and the symplectic groups. This work is a natural follow-up to arXiv:2212.05790 and to arXiv:1708.06420.</description>

      <title>Radicals and Nilpotents in Equivariant Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associated to each Tambara functor $T$ is its Nakaoka spectrum $\mathrm{Spec}(T)$, analogous to the Zariski spectrum of a commutative ring. We establish that this topological space is spectral. This result follows from an analysis of the notion of nilpotence in Tamabra functors. We prove that the nilradical of a Tambara functor $T$ (the intersection of all of its prime ideals) is computed levelwise, i.e. consists precisely of the nilpotent elements in $T$. In contrast to ordinary commutative algebra, the nilpotents of $T$ are not the same as the elements $x$ such that $T[1/x] = 0$; we therefore also give a classification of these elements. As a corollary, we observe that the set of these elements in $\pi_\star^s$ (the equivariant stable stems, viewed as an $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded Tambara functor) forms an ideal.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Factors and LRS-Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three new, practical algorithms for polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: one to test if a polynomial is cyclotomic, one to determine which cyclotomic polynomials are factors, and one to determine whether the given polynomial is LRS-degenerate. A polynomial is "LRS-degenerate" iff it has two distinct roots $\alpha, \beta$ such that $\beta = \zeta \alpha$ for some root of unity $\zeta$. All three algorithms are based on "intelligent brute force". The first two produce the indexes of the cyclotomic polynomials; the third produces a list of degeneracy orders. The algorithms are implemented in CoCoALib.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic vanishing of cohomology in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graded-commutative ring acting centrally on a triangulated category, our main result shows that if cohomology of a pair of objects of the triangulated category is finitely generated over the ring acting centrally, then the asymptotic vanishing of the cohomology is well-behaved. In particular, enough consecutive asymptotic vanishing of cohomology implies all eventual vanishing. Several key applications are also given.</description>
