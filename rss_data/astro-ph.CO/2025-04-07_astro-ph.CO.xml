      <title>Supersizing hydrodynamical simulations of reionization using perturbative techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that perturbative techniques inspired by effective field theory (EFT) can be used to "paint on" the 21~cm field during reionization using only the underlying linear density field. This procedure is accurate to within O(10%) on large scales and thus can be used to enlarge or "supersize" hydrodynamical simulations. In particular, the EFT provides a mapping between the linear density field and a nonlinear tracer field, both in real and redshift space. We show that this mapping can be reliably extracted from relatively small simulation volumes using the THESAN suite of simulations, which have a comoving volume of (95.5 Mpc)^3. Specifically, we show that if we fit the EFT coefficients in a small ~5% sub-volume of the simulation, we can accurately predict the 21cm field in the rest of the simulation given only the linear density field. We show that our technique is robust to different models of dark matter and differences in the sub-grid reionization modeling.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XVII. New time delays in 22 lensed quasars from optical monitoring with the ESO-VST 2.6m and MPG 2.2m telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new time delays, the main ingredient of time delay cosmography, for 22 lensed quasars resulting from high-cadence r-band monitoring on the 2.6 m ESO VLT Survey Telescope and Max-Planck-Gesellschaft 2.2 m telescope. Each lensed quasar was typically monitored for one to four seasons, often shared between the two telescopes to mitigate the interruptions forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of targets consists of 19 quadruply and 3 doubly imaged quasars, which received a total of 1 918 hours of on-sky time split into 21 581 wide-field frames, each 320 seconds long. In a given field, the 5-{\sigma} depth of the combined exposures typically reaches the 27th magnitude, while that of single visits is 24.5 mag - similar to the expected depth of the upcoming Vera-Rubin LSST. The fluxes of the different lensed images of the targets were reliably de-blended, providing not only light curves with photometric precision down to the photon noise limit, but also high-resolution models of the targets whose features and astrometry were systematically confirmed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This was made possible thanks to a new photometric pipeline, lightcurver, and the forward modelling method STARRED. Finally, the time delays between pairs of curves and their uncertainties were estimated, taking into account the degeneracy due to microlensing, and for the first time the full covariance matrices of the delay pairs are provided. Of note, this survey, with 13 square degrees, has applications beyond that of time delays, such as the study of the structure function of the multiple high-redshift quasars present in the footprint at a new high in terms of both depth and frequency. The reduced images will be available through the European Southern Observatory Science Portal.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on superconducting cosmic strings in light of Dark Ages global 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Superconducting Cosmic Strings (SCS) are a special case of cosmic strings that have a core carrying a charged field. When SCS pass through magnetized regions, the charged particles in the string experience a Lorentz force, which can produce radiation on the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation can inject energy into the surrounding plasma, resulting in a modification of the thermal and ionization evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and, subsequently, the global 21-cm signal. The signatures of SCS in the post-recombination era have been primarily studied in the low-frequency (radio) regime, which does not impact the state of the IGM. In this work, we study the effect of decaying SCS on the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal $(\delta T_b)$, considering both the ionizing and radio radiations. The Dark Ages signal can provide pristine cosmological information free from astrophysical uncertainties, as the universe was primarily homogeneous during this era in the absence of baryonic structure formation. Considering a change in the $\delta T_b$ at redshift $z\sim 89$ from the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ framework to be $5\,\rm mK$ and $15\,\rm mK$, we derive an upper bound on the loop current of cosmic string, $I\gtrsim 11.5\,\rm GeV$, and string tension, $G\mu_s\gtrsim 2.5\times 10^{-15}$.</description>

      <title>Unexpected clustering pattern in dwarf galaxies challenges formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03305v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation, and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here, we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a $\Lambda$CDM framework, and our finding provides new clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.</description>

      <title>Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.</description>

      <title>The Poisson noise in modeling the redshift-space distortion at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the errors in modeling the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect at large linear scales, using data from the Millennium simulation. While standard theoretical templates, such as the Kaiser formula and the TNS method, could precisely model RSD for individual large-scale modes, we find that for tracers with number densities lower than $\sim10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, there is a few-percent level bias in the predicted power spectrum. This error arises due to the amplification of intrinsic Poisson noise during RSD modeling from real-space power spectrum. This amplified noise can be analytically expressed as $1 + \epsilon/[{\bar{n}P}({1+\epsilon})]$, with $\epsilon=2\beta/3+\beta^2/5$, where $P$ denotes the real-space tracer power spectrum and $\beta \equiv f/b$. Specifically, for halos with a number density of around $5\times10^{-4}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, this phenomenon results in an additional systematic error of 2.5\%. Our result suggests that caution should be exercised when modeling the RSD directly using real-space power spectra of tracers measured from simulations or from the real surveys. This is relevant, e.g., in situations where the real-space tracer power spectrum is predicted by emulators trained using simulation data.</description>

      <title>The impact of diffuse Galactic emission on direction-independent gain calibration in high-redshift 21 cm observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of diffuse Galactic emission on sky-based direction-independent (DI) gain calibration using realistic forward simulations of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the high-redshift 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We simulated LOFAR observations between 147 - 159 MHz using a sky model that includes a point source catalogue and diffuse Galactic emission. The simulated observations were DI-gain calibrated with the point source catalogue alone, utilising the LOFAR-EoR data analysis pipeline. A full power spectrum analysis was conducted to assess the systematic bias introduced by DI-gain calibration using complete and incomplete sky models, relative to thermal noise. Additionally, the cross-coherence between observation pairs was computed to determine whether DI-gain calibration errors are coherent or incoherent in specific regions of power spectrum space as a function of integration time. We find that DI-gain calibration with an incomplete sky model that omits diffuse Galactic emission introduces a systematic bias in the power spectrum for $k_{\parallel}$ bins &lt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The power spectrum errors in these bins are coherent; therefore, the resulting bias can be mitigated during the foreground removal step. In contrast, errors for $k_{\parallel}$ &gt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ are largely incoherent and average down as noise. We conclude that missing diffuse Galactic emission in the sky model is not a significant contributor to the excess noise observed in the current LOFAR-EoR upper limit results on the 21 cm signal power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for interacting dark energy with time-dependent momentum exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of interacting dark energy and dark matter offer a possible solution to cosmological tensions. In this work, we examine a pure momentum-exchange model with a time-dependent coupling strength $\xi(z)$ that could help to alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We perform Fisher forecasting and MCMC analysis to constrain the coupling strength of this interaction for different redshift bins $0.0&lt;z&lt;2.1$, using the specifications of upcoming DESI-like surveys. For this analysis, we examine both a model with a constant equation of state $w=-0.9$, as well as a thawing dark energy model with an evolving $w(z)$. We show that, for a constant equation of state, $\xi(z)$ can be well constrained in all redshift bins. However, due to a weaker effect at early times, the constraints are significantly reduced at high redshifts in the case of a thawing $w(z)$ model.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Ain't no resonance high enough: Core collapse in self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>The Scale for the Expansion of the Universe: From Local Structures to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study tackles the impact dark energy in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space to compare gravity tests across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (MCV), that connect spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing invariant scalars, the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that galaxy groups and clusters exhibit Kretschmann scalar values consistent with the Cosmological Constant curvature, indicating where dark energy dominates.</description>

      <title>Probing Gauged $U(1)$ Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Cosmic Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. Furthermore, by utilizing constraints from the CR cooling effect in NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, we explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections. Our results indicate that in the sub-GeV DM mass range, these constraints are more stringent than those from certain boosted DM mechanisms and current direct detection limits.</description>

      <title>The AI Cosmologist I: An Agentic System for Automated Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from cosmological CP breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that baryogenesis can arise from the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that governs CP-violating parameters, such as the Yukawa couplings and the theta terms of the Standard Model. During the big bang, this scalar may reach a CP-violating minimum, where its mass can be comparable to the inflationary Hubble scale. Such dynamics can emerge in theories featuring either a spontaneously broken local U(1) symmetry or modular invariance. The latter arises naturally as the effective field theory capturing the geometric origin of CP violation in toroidal string compactifications. Modular baryogenesis is compatible with the modular approach to resolving the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light is a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution in clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: A fast semi-analytic model emulator of hydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will detect faint galaxies in massive clusters, advancing our understanding of galaxy formation in dense environments. Comparing these observations with theoretical models requires high-resolution cluster simulations. Hydrodynamical simulations resolve galaxy properties in halos, but face challenges simulating low-mass galaxies due to computational limitations. In contrast, dark matter-only (DMO) simulations can provide higher resolution but need models to populate subhalos with galaxies. In this work, we introduce a fast and efficient emulator of hydrodynamical cluster simulations, based on the semi-analytic models (SAMs) SAGE and SAG. The SAMs are calibrated using cluster galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations at intermediate resolution, ensuring consistency in stellar masses and luminosities across redshifts. These SAMs are then applied to DMO simulations from The Three Hundred Project at three resolutions. We show that the SAG model, unlike SAGE, better emulates galaxy properties even at the highest resolution. This improvement is due to the treatment of orphan galaxies, which contribute significantly to the total population. SAG enables the study of dwarf galaxies down to stellar masses of 10^7 solar masses at the highest resolution, an order of magnitude smaller than those in the hydrodynamical simulations, corresponding to approximately four magnitudes fainter. This shows that SAMs can be effectively calibrated to provide fast and accurate predictions of hydrodynamical simulations, offering an efficient alternative to explore galaxy populations in dense environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on cosmological constraints of dark energy (DE) parametrizations after the observations of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instruments (DESI) for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in 2024, suggesting potential deviations from the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This study aims to put observational constraints on equation of state (EoS) parametrizations beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using DESI BAO 2024 data, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy observations 2018, and various Supernovae type Ia (SNIa) compilations: PantheonPlus, Union3, and Dark Energy Survey 5-year photometrically classified SNIa (DES-SN5YR). Our main goal is to validate the result of DESI collaborations \cite{DESI:2024mwx} in the context of some parametrizations beyond the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) approximation known as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Pad\'e parametrizations. These investigations allow us to examine the potential biases in the results presented by DESI collaborations with respect to CPL parametrization. By comparing our findings using BA and Pad\'e parametrizations to the CPL case, we indicate that the deviation from $w_{\Lambda} = -1.0$, observed in the CPL parametrization, is also evident in the BA and Pad\'e parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Profile Likelihoods in Cosmology: When, Why and How illustrated with $\Lambda$CDM, Massive Neutrinos and Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequentist parameter inference using profile likelihoods has received increased attention in the cosmology literature recently since it can give important complementary information to Bayesian credible intervals. Here, we give a pedagogical review of frequentist parameter inference in cosmology and focus on when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives meaningful constraints, i.e. confidence intervals with correct coverage. This construction rests on the assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data set such as in Wilks' theorem. We assess the validity of this assumption in the context of three cosmological models with Planck 2018 Plik_lite data: While our tests for the $\Lambda$CDM model indicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct coverage, $\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter appears consistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the boundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find indication of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist and Bayesian constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using the graphical profile likelihood method in cosmology. Along with this paper, we publish our profile-likelihood code "pinc".</description>

Abstract: Statistics that capture the directional dependence of the baryon distribution in the cosmic web enable unique tests of cosmology and astrophysical feedback. We use constrained oriented stacking of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps to measure the anisotropic distribution of hot gas $2.5-40$ Mpc away from galaxy clusters embedded in massive filaments and superclusters. The cluster selection and orientation (at a scale of $\sim15$ Mpc) use Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data, while expanded tSZ maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 enable a $\sim3\times$ more significant measurement of the extended gas compared to the technique's proof-of-concept. Decomposing stacks into cosine multipoles of order $m$, we detect a dipole ($m=1$) and quadrupole ($m=2$) at $8-10\sigma$, as well as evidence for $m=4$ signal at up to $6\sigma$, indicating sensitivity to late-time non-Gaussianity. We compare to the Cardinal simulations with spherical gas models pasted onto dark matter halos. The fiducial tSZ data can discriminate between two models that deplete pressure differently in low-mass halos (mimicking astrophysical feedback), preferring higher average pressure in extended structures. However, uncertainty in the amount of cosmic infrared background contamination reduces the constraining power. Additionally, we apply the technique to DES galaxy density and weak lensing to study for the first time their oriented relationships with tSZ. In the tSZ-to-lensing relation, averaged on 7.5 Mpc (transverse) scales, we observe dependence on redshift but not shape or radial distance. Thus, on large scales, the superclustering of gas pressure, galaxies, and total matter is coherent in shape and extent.</description>

      <title>Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_{\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the homogeneous model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\mathrm{V}}$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the void models give only $47.3 - 51.2$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.3\sigma$ without a void to $1.1\sigma - 1.4\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth. The void-free model provides the worst fit in almost every case. Overall, our results suggest that recent evidence of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>Updated cosmological constraints on axion dark energy with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the parameters of an axion dark energy model, for which we took into account the properties of its characteristic potential and its full cosmological evolution. We show that the values of the axion parameters appear sufficiently constrained by the data, including the latest DESI DR1, and are consistent with the theoretical expectations of a field mass $m_a$ in the ultralight regime $\log (m_a c^2/\mathrm{eV}) \simeq -32.6$, and an effective energy scale $f_a$ close to the reduced Planck energy $\log (f_a/M_\mathrm{Pl}) \simeq -0.22$. Our results also support the idea of dynamical dark energy, although Bayesian evidence still favors the phenomenological dark energy model $w_0w_a$ over the axion dark energy, with the Bayes factor indicating moderate and weak strength of the evidence, respectively, when the models are compared to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. However, the results suggest that axion dark energy remains a well-motivated model and may even become more competitive compared to other options with the help of upcoming DESI data.</description>

      <title>Probing the Distance Duality Relation with Machine Learning and Recent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened primordial black holes on high-scale leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the back-reaction of evaporation on the quantum state of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), known as ``memory burden", on the baryon asymmetry production in the Universe through high-scale leptogenesis. Focusing on PBH masses ranging from 1 to 1000 grams, we investigate the interplay between the non-thermal production of heavy sterile neutrinos and the entropy injection within this non-standard cosmological framework. By assuming appropriate values for the memory-burden parameters, $q=1/2$ and $k=1$, we derive mutual exclusion limits between PBHs and thermal leptogenesis in the mixed parameter space. Our analysis reveals that the primary contribution of PBHs to baryon asymmetry stems from entropy injection. Indeed, we find that, differently from earlier studies based on the semi-classical Hawking evaporation, the memory-burden effect suppresses the non-thermal source term in the PBH mass range explored. This has significant implications for understanding baryogenesis in such alternative cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate valid in the small supercooling regime which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares. While our analysis approximates the equation of state using the template model, we demonstrate that our conclusions remain robust when incorporating state-of-the-art QCD equation of state data.</description>
