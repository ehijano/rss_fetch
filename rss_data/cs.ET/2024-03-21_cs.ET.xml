      <title>Dual-sided transparent display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, display technology has been reimagined to meet the needs of the virtual world. By mapping information onto a scene through a transparent display, users can simultaneously visualize both the real world and layers of virtual elements. However, advances in augmented reality (AR) technology have primarily focused on wearable gear or personal devices. Here we present a single display capable of delivering visual information to observers positioned on either side of the transparent device. This dual-sided display system employs a polymer stabilized liquid crystal waveguide technology to achieve a transparency window of 65% while offering active-matrix control. An early-stage prototype exhibits full-color information via time-sequential processing of a red-green-blue (RGB) light-emitting diode (LED) strip. The dual-sided display provides a perspective on transparent mediums as display devices for human-centric and service-related experiences that can support both enhanced bi-directional user interactions and new media platforms.</description>

      <title>VL-DNA: Enhance DNA Storage Capacity with Variable Payload (Strand) Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA storage is a promising archival data storage solution to today's big data problem. A DNA storage system encodes and stores digital data with synthetic DNA sequences and decodes DNA sequences back to digital data via sequencing. For efficient target data retrieving, existing Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR based DNA storage systems apply primers as specific identifier to tag different set of DNA strands. However, the PCR based DNA storage system suffers from primer-payload collisions, causing a significant reduction of storage capacity. This paper proposes using variable strand length, which takes advantage of the inherent payload-cutting process, to split collisions and recover primers. The executing time of our scheme is linear to the number of primer-payload collisions. The scheme serves as a post-processing method to any DNA encoding scheme. The evaluation of three state-of-the-art encoding schemes shows that the scheme can recover thousands of usable primers and improve tube capacity ranging from 18.27% to 19x.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Distributed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various collaborative distributed machine learning (CDML) systems, including federated learning systems and swarm learning systems, with different key traits were developed to leverage resources for development and use of machine learning (ML) models in a confidentiality-preserving way. To meet use case requirements, suitable CDML systems need to be selected. However, comparison between CDML systems regarding their suitability for use cases is often difficult. This work presents a CDML system conceptualization and CDML archetypes to support comparison of CDML systems and introduce scientific and practical audiences to the principal functioning and key traits of CDML systems.</description>
