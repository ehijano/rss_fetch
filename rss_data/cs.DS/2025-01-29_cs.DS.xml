      <title>Latency Guarantees for Caching with Delayed Hits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical caching problem, when a requested page is not present in the cache (i.e., a "miss"), it is assumed to travel from the backing store into the cache "before" the next request arrives. However, in many real-life applications, such as content delivery networks, this assumption is unrealistic.
  The "delayed-hits" model for caching, introduced by Atre, Sherry, Wang, and Berger, accounts for the latency between a missed cache request and the corresponding arrival from the backing store. This theoretical model has two parameters: the "delay" $Z$, representing the ratio between the retrieval delay and the inter-request delay in an application, and the "cache size" $k$, as in classical caching. Classical caching corresponds to $Z=1$, whereas larger values of $Z$ model applications where retrieving missed requests is expensive. Despite the practical relevance of the delayed-hits model, its theoretical underpinnings are still poorly understood.
  We present the first tight theoretical guarantee for optimizing delayed-hits caching: The "Least Recently Used" algorithm, a natural, deterministic, online algorithm widely used in practice, is $O(Zk)$-competitive, meaning it incurs at most $O(Zk)$ times more latency than the (offline) optimal schedule. Our result extends to any so-called "marking" algorithm.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Parameter Tuning of Level-1 QAOA for Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\gamma, \beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\gamma, \beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\gamma$, with $\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\gamma^* \in \mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Set Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private (DP) mechanisms for representing sets of size $k$ from a large universe. Our first construction creates $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP representations with error probability of $1/(e^\epsilon + 1)$ using space at most $1.05 k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits where the time to construct a representation is $O(k \log(1/\delta))$ while decoding time is $O(\log(1/\delta))$. We also present a second algorithm for pure $\epsilon$-DP representations with the same error using space at most $k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits, but requiring large decoding times. Our algorithms match our lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-offs (including constants but ignoring $\delta$ factors) and we also present a new space lower bound matching our constructions up to small constant factors. To obtain our results, we design a new approach embedding sets into random linear systems deviating from most prior approaches that inject noise into non-private solutions.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Transitively Orienting Temporal Graphs</title>

Abstract: In a temporal network with discrete time-labels on its edges, entities and information can only ``flow'' along sequences of edges whose time-labels are non-decreasing (resp. increasing), i.e. along temporal (resp. strict temporal) paths. Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe, Kleinberg, Kumar, JCSS, 2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\{u,v\}$ with time-label $t$ specifies that ``$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$''.
  In this paper we make a first attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge can impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically, naturally extending the classical notion of a transitive orientation in static graphs, we introduce the fundamental notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we systematically investigate its algorithmic behavior. An orientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever $u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a directed edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a directed edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\geq t_2$. If we just demand that this implication holds whenever $t_2 &gt; t_1$, we call the orientation strictly temporally transitive, as it is based on the strict directed temporal path from $u$ to $w$.
  Our main result is a conceptually simple, yet technically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast we prove that, surprisingly, it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\mathcal{G}$ is strictly transitively orientable. Additionally we introduce and investigate further related problems to temporal transitivity, notably among them the temporal transitive completion problem, for which we prove both algorithmic and hardness results.</description>

      <title>Constant-delay enumeration for SLP-compressed documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of enumerating results from a query over a compressed document. The model we use for compression are straight-line programs (SLPs), which are defined by a context-free grammar that produces a single string. For our queries, we use a model called Annotated Automata, an extension of regular automata that allows annotations on letters. This model extends the notion of Regular Spanners as it allows arbitrarily long outputs. Our main result is an algorithm that evaluates such a query by enumerating all results with output-linear delay after a preprocessing phase which takes linear time on the size of the SLP, and cubic time over the size of the automaton. This is an improvement over Schmid and Schweikardt's result, which, with the same preprocessing time, enumerates with a delay that is logarithmic on the size of the uncompressed document. We achieve this through a persistent data structure named Enumerable Compact Sets with Shifts which guarantees output-linear delay under certain restrictions. These results imply constant-delay enumeration algorithms in the context of regular spanners. Further, we use an extension of annotated automata which utilizes succinctly encoded annotations to save an exponential factor from previous results that dealt with constant-delay enumeration over vset automata. Lastly, we extend our results in the same fashion Schmid and Schweikardt did to allow complex document editing while maintaining the constant delay guarantee.</description>

      <title>Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to draw a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $\Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem \emph{without communicating at all?} Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $\Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$ using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. This bound was shown to be optimal in the worst-case by [Bavarian et al., 2020]. In this work, we revisit the communication-free coupling problem. We provide a simpler proof of the optimality result from [Bavarian et al., 2020]. We show that, while the worst-case success probability of Weighted MinHash cannot be improved, an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling offers a Pareto improvement: for every pair of distributions $P, Q$, Gumbel sampling achieves an equal or higher value of $\Pr[a = b]$ than Weighted MinHash. Importantly, this improvement translates to practice. We demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to \emph{speculative decoding}, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols can be used to contruct \emph{\CSD{}} schemes, which have the desirable property that their output is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation. In experiments on a language generation task, Gumbel sampling outperforms Weighted MinHash. Code is available at https://github.com/majid-daliri/DISD.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Graph States via Path Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal scheduling of graph states in measurement-based quantum computation, establishing an equivalence between measurement schedules and path decompositions of graphs. We define the spatial cost of a measurement schedule based on the number of simultaneously active qubits and prove that an optimal measurement schedule corresponds to a path decomposition of minimal width. Our analysis shows that approximating the spatial cost of a graph is $\textsf{NP}$-hard, while for graphs with bounded spatial cost, we establish an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal measurement schedule.</description>
