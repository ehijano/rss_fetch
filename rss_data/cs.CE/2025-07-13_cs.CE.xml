      <title>EP-GAT: Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network for Stock Trend Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks. Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE). The experimental results demonstrate that EP-GAT consistently outperforms competitive five baselines on test periods across various metrics. The ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis further validate the effectiveness of each module in the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023 to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative, disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context of each output.</description>

      <title>To Trade or Not to Trade: An Agentic Approach to Estimating Market Risk Improves Trading Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating diversion and treatment policies for opioid use disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The United States (US) opioid crisis contributed to 81,806 fatalities in 2022. It has strained hospitals, treatment facilities, and law enforcement agencies due to the enormous resources and procedures needed to respond to the crisis. As a result, many individuals who use opioids never receive or finish the treatment they need and instead have many interactions with hospitals or the criminal justice system. This paper introduces a discrete event simulation model that evaluates three opioid use disorder treatment policies: arrest diversion, re-entry case management, and overdose diversion. Publicly available data from 2011 to 2019 in Dane County, Wisconsin, was used to forecast opioid-related outcomes through 2032. Through analyzing a variety of policy-mix implementations, the study offers a versatile framework for evaluating policies at various implementation levels. The results demonstrate that treatment policies that create new pathways and programming by utilizing treatment services and successfully divert at least 20% of eligible individuals can lead to more opioid-resilient communities. The benefits increase when more policies are enacted and/or offered to more individuals, with the largest impact from overdose diversion, followed by re-entry case management, and the smallest impact from arrest diversion. The statistically significant 10-year cumulative total reduction in societal costs from 2023 through 2032 ranges from $39 M (USD) to $584 M (USD), excluding implementation costs of policies. To reverse the opioid crisis within a community, treatment policies may need to be combined with other strategies, such as harm reduction, supply reduction, and use prevention.</description>

      <title>Optimizing wheel loader performance -- an end-to-end approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. Automating this task presents a challenging planning problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and transportation costs between the pile and load receivers. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>
