      <title>Evolution of Spatial Complexity in Flare Ribbon Substructure and Its Relationship to Magnetic Reconnection Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in the tidal disruption event AT2020afhd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the coprecession of both the accretion disk and the jet formed following the tidal disruption event associated with the optical transient AT2020afhd, driven by a supermassive black hole of almost ten million solar masses, were independently measured in both the X and radio bands, respectively, showing a periodicity of nearly 20 days over about 300 days. An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular ion heating in turbulence and reconnection: magnetic moment breaking by coherent fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of an ion with a fluctuation in the electromagnetic fields that is localized in both space and time. We study the scale-dependence of the interaction in both space and time, deriving a generic form for the ion's energy change, which involves an exponential cutoff based on the characteristic timescale of the electromagnetic fluctuation. This leads to diffusion in energy in both $v_\perp$ and $v_\parallel$. We show how to apply our results to general plasma physics phenomena, and specifically to Alfv\'enic turbulence and to reconnection. Our theory can be viewed as a unification of previous models of stochastic ion heating, cyclotron heating, and reconnection heating in a single theoretical framework.</description>
