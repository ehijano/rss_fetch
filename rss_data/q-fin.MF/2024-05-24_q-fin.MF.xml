      <title>Long Time Behavior of Optimal Liquidation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long time behavior of an optimal liquidation problem with semimartingale strategies and external flows. To investigate the limit rigorously, we study the convergence of three BSDEs characterizing the value function and the optimal strategy, from finite horizon to infinite horizon. We find that in the long time limit the player may not necessarily liquidate her assets at all due to the existence of external flows, even if in any given finite time horizon, the player is forced to liquidate all assets. Moreover, when the intensity of the external flow is damped, the player will liquidate her assets in the long run.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time Equilibrium Returns in Markets with Price Impact and Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an Ito-financial market at which the risky assets' returns are derived endogenously through a market-clearing condition amongst heterogeneous risk-averse investors with quadratic preferences and random endowments. Investors act strategically by taking into account the impact that their orders have on the assets' drift. A frictionless market and an one with quadratic transaction costs are analysed and compared. In the former, we derive the unique Nash equilibrium at which investors' demand processes reveal different hedging needs than their true ones, resulting in a deviation of the Nash equilibrium from its competitive counterpart. Under price impact and transaction costs, we characterize the Nash equilibrium as the (unique) solution of a system of FBSDEs and derive its closed-form expression. We furthermore show that under common risk aversion and absence of noise traders, transaction costs do not change the equilibrium returns. On the contrary, when noise traders are present, the effect of transaction costs on equilibrium returns is amplified due to price impact.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of kernel learning FBSDE filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel learning forward backward SDE filter is an iterative and adaptive meshfree approach to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. It builds from forward backward SDE for Fokker-Planker equation, which defines evolving density for the state variable, and employs KDE to approximate density. This algorithm has shown more superior performance than mainstream particle filter method, in both convergence speed and efficiency of solving high dimension problems.
  However, this method has only been shown to converge empirically. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis to demonstrate its local and global convergence, and provide theoretical support for its empirical results.</description>

      <title>am-AMM: An Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as the dominant market mechanism for trading on decentralized exchanges implemented on blockchains. This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM.</description>
