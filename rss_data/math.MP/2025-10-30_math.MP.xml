      <title>Liquid-vapor transition in a model of a continuum particle system with finite-range modified Kac pair potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a phase transition in dimension $d&gt;1$ in a continuum particle system interacting with a pair potential containing a modified attractive Kac potential of range $\gamma^{-1}$, with $\gamma&gt;0$. This transition is "close", for small positive $\gamma$, to the one proved previously by Lebowitz and Penrose in the van der Waals limit $\gamma\downarrow0$. It is of the type of the liquid-vapor transition observed when a fluid, like water, heated at constant pressure, boils at a given temperature. Previous results on phase transitions in continuum systems with stable potentials required the use of unphysical four-body interactions or special symmetries between the liquid and vapor.
  The pair interaction we consider is obtained by partitioning space into cubes of volume $\gamma^{-d}$, and letting the Kac part of the pair potential be uniform in each cube and act only between adjacent cubes. The "short-range" part of the pair potential is quite general (in particular, it may or may not include a hard core), but restricted to act only between particles in the same cube.
  Our setup, the "boxed particle model", is a special case of a general "spin" system, for which we establish a first-order phase transition using reflection positivity and the Dobrushin--Shlosman criterion.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, building on two recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory. The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical structures.</description>

      <title>On a wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening in oceanography and atmospheric sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a three-wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening arising from the theory of stratified ocean flows. Unlike Gamba-Smith-Tran(On the wave turbulence theory for stratified flows in the ocean, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 30 (2020), no.1, 105--137), we employ a different formulation of the resonance broadening, which makes the present model more suitable for ocean applications. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the new resonance broadening kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Critical temperatures and collapsing of two-dimensional Log gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the canonical ensemble of a system of point particles on the sphere interacting via a logarithmic pair potential. In this setting, we study the associated Gibbs measure and partition function, and we derive explicit formulas relating the critical temperature, at which the partition function diverges, to a certain discrete optimization problem. We further show that the asymptotic behavior of both the partition function and the Gibbs measure near the critical temperature is governed by the same optimization problem. Our approach relies on the Fulton--MacPherson compactification of configuration spaces and analytic continuation of complex powers. To illustrate the results, we apply them to well-studied systems, including the two-component plasma and the Onsager model of turbulence. In particular, for the two-component plasma with general charges, we describe the formation of dipoles close to the critical temperature, which we determine explicitly.</description>

      <title>Topological index formula in physical waves: spectral flow, Chern index and topological contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of pseudodifferential operators (quantum Hamiltonians) on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n};\mathbb{C}^{d})$ whose spectrum exhibits two energy bands exchanging a finite number of eigenvalues. We show that this number coincides with the Chern index of a vector bundle associated to the principal symbol (the classical Hamiltonian). This result provides a simple yet illustrative instance of the Atiyah Singer index formula, with applications in areas such as molecular physics, plasma physics or geophysics. We also discuss the phenomenon of topological contact without exchange between energy bands, a feature that cannot be detected by the Chern index or K theory, but rather reflects subtle torsion effects in the homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from an $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and an $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Covariance of Scattering Amplitudes from Counting Carefully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.</description>

      <title>Universal Limits on Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental limits of quantum correlations set the foundation of quantum mechanics and quantum information science. Exact bounds-the Cramer-Rao inequality, the Heisenberg limit, and the Lieb-Robinson bound-have anchored entire fields, yet each applies only to a narrow class of systems or observables. Here we introduce a general framework from which all known correlation limits, as well as new ones, can be derived from a single geometric principle: the positivity of quantum state space. This intrinsic positive geometry defines a unique determinant-ratio invariant, denoted chi, which quantifies the combinatorial structure of correlations in any quantum system. Every measure of nonclassical correlation is bounded by a simple function of chi, yielding universal, model-independent floors and ceilings valid for arbitrary architectures. For systems with Lie-group symmetries, the bounds acquire compact closed forms. We recover the Heisenberg and Cramer-Rao limits and uncover previously unknown constraints, including an exact entanglement floor in multimode squeezing networks and a universal Fisher-information ceiling in fully connected spin ensembles-demonstrating that even all-to-all connectivity cannot exceed the positivity-imposed light cone in state space. Finally, we show that every correlation bound, old or new, exhibits local catastrophe-theoretic structure, with universal critical exponents classifying its approach to saturation. Positivity geometry thus provides a unified, first-principles theory of quantum limits.</description>

      <title>Universality of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly-periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish conformal invariance of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly periodic graphs, showing that their scaling limit coincides with that of the critical square lattice, as originally proved in \cite{CHI}. To overcome the absence of integrability and quantitative full plane constructions in the periodic setting, we combine discrete analytic tools with random cluster methods. This result completes the universality picture for periodic lattices, whose criticality condition was identified in \cite{cimasoni-duminil} and whose conformal structure and interface convergence were obtained in \cite{Che20}.</description>

Abstract: Let $A=A_{G,N}^{\hbar=1}$ be a quantized Coulomb branch with an antilinear automorphism $\rho$. A map $T\colon A\to\mathbb{C}$ is called a positive trace if $T(a\rho(a))&gt;0$ for all nonzero $a\in A$. Positive traces on Coulomb branches appear in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on all abelian Coulomb branches, meaning $G=(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^d$ is a torus.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formation in Diffusive Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the formation of clusters for stochastic interacting particle systems (SIPS) that interact through short-range attractive potentials in a periodic domain. We consider kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics and focus on the low-friction regime. Employing a linear stability analysis for the kinetic McKean-Vlasov equation, we show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, and for sufficiently short-ranged interactions, the particles form clusters that correspond to metastable states of the mean-field dynamics. We derive the friction and particle-count dependent cluster-formation time and numerically measure the friction-dependent times to reach a stationary state (given by a state in which all particles are bound in a single cluster). By providing both theory and numerical methods in the inertial stochastic setting, this work acts as a bridge between cluster formation studies in overdamped Langevin dynamics and the Hamiltonian (microcanonical) limit.</description>

      <title>Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anosov geodesic flows are among the simplest mathematical models of deterministic chaos. In this survey we explain how, quite unexpectedly, quantum dynamics emerges from purely classical correlation functions. The underlying mechanism is the discrete Pollicott Ruelle spectrum of the geodesic flow, revealed through microlocal analysis. This spectrum naturally arranges into vertical bands; when the rightmost band is separated from the rest by a gap, it governs an effective dynamics that mirrors quantum evolution.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastically perturbed wave maps from $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into $\mathbb{S}^d$, in all energy-supercritical dimensions $d \geq 3$. We show that corotational non-degenerate Gaussian additive noise leads to self-similar blowup with positive probability for any corotational initial data. The same result without noise is conjectured, but unknown, for large data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling functions of single-time and two-time correlators in systems undergoing non-equilibrium critical dynamics with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$ are predicted from a new time-dependent non-equilibrium representation of the Schr\"odinger algebra. These explicit predictions are tested and confirmed in the ageing of several exactly solvable models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of non-constant periodic solutions to the Lorentz force equation, where no scalar potential is needed to induce the electromagnetic field. Our results extend to cases where a possibly singular scalar potential is present, although the vector potential assumes a leading role. The approach is based on minimizing the action functional associated with the relativistic Lagrangian. The compactness of the minimizing sequences requires the existence of negative values for the functional, which is proven using novel ideas that exploit the sign-indefinite nature of the term involving the vector potential.</description>

      <title>On the injective norm of random fermionic states and skew-symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the injective norm of random skew-symmetric tensors and the associated fermionic quantum states, a natural measure of multipartite entanglement for systems of indistinguishable particles. Extending recent advances on random quantum states, we analyze both real and complex skew-symmetric Gaussian ensembles in two asymptotic regimes: fixed particle number with increasing one-particle Hilbert space dimension, and joint scaling with fixed filling fraction. Using the Kac--Rice formula on the Grassmann manifold, we derive high-probability upper bounds on the injective norm and establish sharp asymptotics in both regimes. Interestingly, a duality relation under particle--hole transformation is uncovered, revealing a symmetry of the injective norm under the action of the Hodge star operator. We complement our analytical results with numerical simulations for low fermion numbers, which match the predicted bounds.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Central Configurations in the Concave 4-Body Problem with Two Pairs of Equal Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a single-parameter family of the concave kite central configurations in the 4-body problem with two pairs of equal masses. In such configurations, one pair of the masses must lie on the base of an isosceles triangle, and the other pair on its symmetric axis with one mass positioned inside the triangle formed by the other three. Using a rigorous computer-assisted analytical approach, we prove that for any non-negative mass ratio, the number of such configurations is either zero, one, or two, which can be viewed as a complete classification of this particular family. Furthermore, we show that the unique configuration corresponding to a specific mass ratio is a fold-type bifurcation point within the reduced subspace. We also give a clear and complete bifurcation picture for both symmetric and asymmetric cases of this concave type in the whole planar 4-body configuration space.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Planar Central Configurations in the $N$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degeneracy of central configurations in the planar $N$-body problem makes their enumeration problem hard and the related dynamics appealing. The degeneracy is always intertwined with the symmetry of the system of central configurations which makes the problem subtle. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system, we systematically explore the direct method to single out trivial zero eigenvalues associated with translational, rotational and scaling symmetries, thereby isolating the non-trivial part of the Jacobian to study the degeneracy. Three distinct formulations of degeneracy are presented, each tailored to handle different formulation of the system. The method is applied to such well-known examples as Lagrange's equilateral triangle solutions for arbitrary masses, the square configuration for four equal masses and the equilateral triangle with a central mass revealing specific mass values for which degeneracy occurs. Combining with the interval algorithm, the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configurations for arbitrary mass is established.</description>

      <title>Dissipative structure and decay rate for an inviscid non-equilibrium radiation hydrodynamics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the diffusion approximation, non-equilibrium model of radiation hydrodynamics derived by Buet and Despr\'es (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf. 85 (2004), no. 3-4, 385-418). The latter describes a non-relativistic inviscid fluid subject to a radiative field under the non-equilibrium hypothesis, that is, when the temperature of the fluid is different from the radiation temperature. It is shown that local solutions exist for the general system in several space dimensions. It is also proved that only the one-dimensional model is genuinely coupled in the sense of Kawashima and Shizuta (Hokkaido Math. J. 14 (1985), no. 2, 249-275). A notion of entropy function for non-conservative parabolic balance laws is also introduced. It is shown that the entropy identified by Buet and Despr\'es is an entropy function for the system in the latter sense. This entropy is used to recast the one-dimensional system in terms of a new set of perturbation variables and to symmetrize it. With the aid of genuine coupling and symmetrization, linear decay rates are obtained for the one dimensional problem. These estimates, combined with the local existence result, yield the global existence and decay in time of perturbations of constant equilibrium states in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Asymmetry in Bosonic Gaussian Systems: A Resource-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry under consideration, coupled to an environment prepared in a symmetry-respecting pure Gaussian state. We further identify a family of tractable monotone functions of states that remain non-increasing under Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics, and are exactly conserved in closed systems. We demonstrate that these monotones are not generally respected under non-Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics. Along the way, we provide several technical results of independent interest to the quantum information and optics communities, including a new approach to the Stinespring dilation theorem, and an extension of Williamson's theorem for the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of Gaussian systems and conserved charges.</description>

Abstract: The spinor tensor $\epsilon_{AB}$ has a special property that its elements can be formulated into an algebraic expression of the indices. All the totally anti-symmetric tensors in Minkowski space are expressed by $\epsilon_{AB}$.

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov.
  Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1306.0602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will analyze through a first order perturbative formulation the local loss of symmetry when a source of electromagnetic and gravitational field interacts with an agent that perturbs the original geometry associated to the source. As the local gauge symmetry in Abelian or even non-Abelian field structures in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes is displayed through the existence of local planes of symmetry that we will refer to as blades one and two, the loss of symmetry will be manifested by the tilting of these planes under the influence of an external agent. In this strict sense the original local symmetry will be lost. We will be able to prove in this way that the new blades at the same point will correspond ''after the tilting generated by perturbation" to a new symmetry. The purpose of this paper is to show that the geometrical manifestation of local gauge symmetries is dynamic. Despite the fact that the local original symmetries will be lost, new symmetries will arise. A dynamic evolution of local symmetries will be evidenced. This result will produce a new theorem on dynamic symmetry evolution.</description>

Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: A DG manifold of amplitude $+1$ encodes the derived intersection of a section $s$ and the zero section of a vector bundle $E$. In this paper, we compute the Atiyah class of DG manifolds of amplitude $+1$. In particular, we show that the Atiyah class vanishes if and only if the intersection of $s$ with the zero section is a clean intersection. As an application, we study the Atiyah class of DG manifolds that encodes the derived intersection of two smooth manifolds.</description>

Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By the FKG inequality for FK-percolation, the probability of the alternating two-arm event is smaller than the product of the probabilities of having a primal arm and a dual arm, respectively. In this paper, we improve this inequality by a polynomial factor for critical planar FK-percolation in the continuous phase transition regime ($1 \leq q \leq 4$). In particular, we prove that if the alternating two-arm exponent $\alpha_{01}$ and the one-arm exponents $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ exist, then they satisfy the strict inequality $\alpha_{01} &gt; \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$. The question was formulated by Garban and Steif in the context of exceptional times and was brought to our attention by Radhakrishnan and Tassion, who obtained the same result for planar Bernoulli percolation through different methods.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Instability and Information Production Around Kerr Black Holes: Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit exponentially unstable motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. This exponentially unstable motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including th non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. For massive particles plunging into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>On the three-point functions in timelike N=1 Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use analytic (super-)conformal bootstrap methods to derive explicit expressions for the structure constants of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Liouville CFT in the `timelike' regime of the superconformal central charge. The obtained expressions take the form of inverses of the appropriate spacelike counterparts, which we explain concretely by elucidating the analytic properties of the corresponding shift relations in the NS- and R-sectors for the normalization-independent bootstrap data on the sphere. In a particular normalization, the timelike structure constants are shown to agree with the OPE coefficients of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minimal Models when specified at degenerate values of the momenta, exactly as in the non-supersymmetric case. We discuss possible applications of our results, with emphasis on the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric analog of the Virasoro Minimal String.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

Abstract: We define Hecke modifications of conformal blocks over affine Lie algebras at non-critical level by using the Hecke modifications of the underlying $G$-bundles. We show that this procedure is equivalent to the insertion of a twisted vacuum module at an additional marked point and provide an explicit description using coordinate transformations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrix via its classical counterpart from random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning with the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a popular approach in quantum variational algorithms. Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). By revealing its relation to covariant measurement in quantum metrology, we show that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random measurement bases yields $\mathbb{E}_{U\sim\mu_H}[F^U(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \frac{1}{2}Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a solid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Quiver superconformal index and giant gravitons: asymptotics and expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</description>

      <title>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</description>
