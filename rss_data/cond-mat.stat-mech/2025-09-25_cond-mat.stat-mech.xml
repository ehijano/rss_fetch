      <title>On the Hydrodynamic Approximation of Quantum Integrable Models -- An Illustration via the repulsive Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized hydrodynamics is a framework to study the large scale dynamics of integrable models, special fine-tuned one-dimensional many-body systems that possess an infinite number of local conserved quantities. Unlike classical models, where the microscopic origins of generalized hydrodynamics are better understood, in quantum models it can only be derived using the hydrodynamic formalism. Using the paradigmatic and experimentally relevant repulsive Lieb-Liniger model as an example, this thesis introduces a new viewpoint on the dynamics of quantum integrable models by introducing so-called semi-classical Bethe models. These classical integrable models act as an intermediate description between the microscopic quantum realm and the macroscopic generalized hydrodynamics. After introducing these models and discussing their properties, we study the generalized hydrodynamics equation using new tools and show that solutions to the Euler generalized hydrodynamics equation of the Lieb-Liniger model exist, are unique and do not develop gradient catastrophes. Finally, we discuss new insights into the physics governing the diffusive correction, which, contrary to prior belief, is not described by a Navier-Stokes-like equation. Focusing on the main intuitive ideas, the thesis aims to provide a self-contained overview over these exciting new developments on generalized hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Curzon Ahlborn Type Efficiency in a Brownian Heat Engine with Exponential Temperature Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Brownian heat engine wherein a particle moves through a periodic ratchet potential under an exponentially decreasing temperature profile, a spatial configuration that closely resembles experimentally realizable conditions such as laser-induced thermal gradients and thermoplasmonic heating. This model yields exact analytical expressions for the particle current, thermodynamic efficiency, entropy production, and coefficient of performance (COP), and uniquely recovers the Curzon Ahlborn efficiency and the corresponding endoreversible COP exactly in the quasistatic limit. These findings provide a rare and rigorous realization of endoreversible thermodynamics at the mesoscopic scale because they are derived directly from microscopic stochastic dynamics without recourse to phenomenological assumptions, asymptotic approximations or coarse-graining techniques. Although the derived efficiency and COP are exact, they remain strictly below the Carnot limit, reflecting the inherent irreversibility embedded within the endoreversible framework. Furthermore, we show that in comparison to linear and piecewise-constant temperature profile cases, the exponential temperature profile leads to significantly higher particle velocities, higher entropy production, but lower thermodynamic efficiency, which underscores the fundamental trade-off between transport speed and energy cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.</description>

      <title>Multicriticality between Purely Gapless SPT Phases with Unitary Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are commonly required to have an energy gap, but recent work has extended the concept to gapless settings. This raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field theory with central charge $c=\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c = 2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address gauge invariance in the statistical mechanics of quantum many-body systems. The gauge transformation acts on the position and momentum degrees of freedom and it is represented by a quantum shifting superoperator that maps quantum observables onto each other. The shifting superoperator is anti-self-adjoint and it has noncommutative Lie algebra structure. These properties induce exact equilibrium sum rules that connect locally-resolved force and hyperforce densities for any given observable. We demonstrate the integration of the framework within quantum hyperdensity functional theory and show that it generalizes naturally to nonequilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Scaling Constraints for Equilibrium Molecular Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular computing promises massive parallelization to explore solution spaces, but so far practical implementations remain limited due to off-target binding and exponential proliferation of competing structures. Here, we investigate the theoretical limits of equilibrium self-assembly systems for solving computing problems, focusing on the directed Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP) as a benchmark for NP-complete problems. The HPP is encoded via particles with directional lock-key patches, where self-assembled chains form candidate solution paths. We determine constraints on the required energy gap between on-target and off-target binding for the HPP to be encoded and solved. We simultaneously examine whether components with the required energy gap can be designed. Combining these results yields a phase diagram identifying regions where HPP instances are both encodable and solvable. These results establish fundamental upper bounds on equilibrium molecular computation and highlight the necessity of non-equilibrium approaches for scalable molecular computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem for time-averaged work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17016v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is evidence that taking the time average of the work performed by a thermally isolated system effectively "transforms" the adiabatic process into an isothermal one. This approach allows inherent quantities of adiabatic processes to be accessed through the definitions of isothermal processes. A fluctuation theorem is then established, linking the time-averaged work to the quasistatic work. Numerical evidence supporting this equality is provided for a classical harmonic oscillator with a driven linear equilibrium position parameter. Furthermore, the strong inequality for the averaged work is derived from the deduced fluctuation theorem using optimality arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.</description>

      <title>Fractals and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes: a perspective from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional spin-$s$ ${\rm SU}(2)$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step $k$ for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a {\it dense} subset in the interval $[0,1]$. As a consequence, the ground state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. Such types of models are quantum reformulations of well-studied two-dimensional classical lattice models, which are known to give rise to limit shapes where expectation values of simple local observables, such as density, depend on position in an appropriate scaling limit. In the case of only nearest neighbor hopping, this model is known to have two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Correlations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. Here we show that another universal higher-order tacnode process can appear upon including the next-nearest neighbor term. We also discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile.</description>

      <title>Role of Translational Noise in Motility-Induced Phase Separation of Hard Active Particles</title>

Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. We find that increasing translational diffusivity has a non-monotonic effect on clustering. At low values, it makes clusters more compact and rounded (less filamentous), eventually promoting genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters evaporate. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>
