      <title>Machine learning approaches to explore important features behind bird flight modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birds exhibit a variety of flight styles, primarily classified as flapping, which is characterized by rapid up-and-down wing movements, and soaring, which involves gliding with wings outstretched. Each species usually performs specific flight styles, and this has been argued in terms of morphological and physiological adaptation. However, it remains a challenge to evaluate the contribution of each factor to the difference in flight styles. In this study, using phenotypic data from 635 migratory bird species, such as body mass, wing length, and breeding periods, we quantified the relative importance of each feature using Feature Importance and SHAP values, and used them to construct weighted L1 distance matrices and construct NJ trees. Comparison with traditional phylogenetic logistic regression revealed similarity in top-ranked features, but also differences in overall weight distributions and clustering patterns in NJ trees. Our results highlight the complexity of constructing a biologically useful distance matrix from correlated phenotypic features, while the complementary nature of these weighting methods suggests the potential utility of multi-faceted approaches to assessing feature contributions.</description>

      <title>Two-step registration method boosts sensitivity in longitudinal fixel-based analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal analyses are increasingly used in clinical studies as they allow the study of subtle changes over time within the same subjects. In most of these studies, it is necessary to align all the images studied to a common reference by registering them to a template. In the study of white matter using the recently developed fixel-based analysis (FBA) method, this registration is important, in particular because the fiber bundle cross-section metric is a direct measure of this registration. In the vast majority of longitudinal FBA studies described in the literature, sessions acquired for a same subject are directly independently registered to the template. However, it has been shown in T1-based morphometry that a 2-step registration through an intra-subject average can be advantageous in longitudinal analyses. In this work, we propose an implementation of this 2-step registration method in a typical longitudinal FBA aimed at investigating the evolution of white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared at the fixel level the mean absolute effect and standard deviation yielded by this registration method and by a direct registration, as well as the results obtained with each registration method for the study of AD in both fixelwise and tract-based analyses. We found that the 2-step method reduced the variability of the measurements and thus enhanced statistical power in both types of analyses.</description>

      <title>NACNet: A Histology Context-aware Transformer Graph Convolution Network for Predicting Treatment Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of AI in digital pathology, particularly in whole slide image (WSI) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis, holds immense potential for enhancing our understanding of diseases. Despite challenges such as training pattern preparation and resolution disparities, the convergence of these technologies can unlock new insights. We introduce QuST, a tool that bridges the gap between WSI and ST, underscoring the transformative power of this integrated approach in disease biology.</description>
