      <title>Asymptotic Freedom for Holographic Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate energy correlators in a holographic model incorporating elements of asymptotic freedom and confinement. We model a running coupling by considering a geometry with a warp factor that deviates logarithmically from anti-de Sitter (AdS). A novel aspect of our bulk metric is that it smoothly interpolates between a Randall-Sundrum solution with a hard wall and a geometry corresponding to a logarithmic running typical of gauge theories. By studying shockwave deformations of this metric, we compute a two-point energy correlator assuming a high-energy scalar source. This extends techniques recently developed for correlators in asymptotically AdS geometries. We use numerical methods to find the profile of shockwaves along the extra dimension, as it does not admit an analytical form. The running coupling leads to a decay of the two-point correlator at small angular separation, unlike the flat correlator one finds in AdS. In the back-to-back limit we observe an exponential falloff similar to other hard-wall models.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Mechanism-Agnostic Fast-Moving Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for interpreting electron recoil signals induced by fast-moving dark matter (DM), applicable across a wide range of theoretically motivated models. Amid both null results in conventional weakly interacting massive particle searches and growing interest in alternative DM scenarios, we focus on (semi-)relativistic DM components that can arise from mechanisms such as DM annihilation, decay, or cosmic-ray acceleration. These boosted DM candidates produce distinct experimental signatures that differ qualitatively from non-relativistic DM, necessitating a dedicated treatment. Our framework incorporates relativistic kinematics and atomic effects through ionization form factors, enabling accurate predictions of differential cross sections in both low- and high-energy regimes. We demonstrate how atomic effects become negligible at high recoil energies, validating the free-electron approximation in specific parameter regions. Furthermore, we highlight the complementarity between low-threshold direct detection experiments and high-threshold neutrino observatories in probing fast-moving DM across broad kinematic domains. This formalism provides a robust and model-independent foundation for interpreting current and future searches for relativistic DM.</description>

      <title>Light new physics and the $\tau$ lepton dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing New-Physics (NP) scenarios that couple predominantly to the third generation is notoriously difficult experimentally, as exemplified by comparing limits for the $\tau$ lepton dipole moments to those of electron and muon. In this case, extracting limits from processes such as $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ often relies on effective-field-theory (EFT) arguments, which allows for model-independent statements, but only applies if the NP scale is sufficiently large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this work we offer a comprehensive analysis of light NP contributions to the $\tau$ dipole moments, providing a detailed account of the interpretation of asymmetry measurements in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ that are tailored towards the extraction of dipole moments, for the test cases of new light spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosons. Moreover, we study the decoupling to the EFT limit in these scenarios and discuss the complementarity to constraints from other related processes, such as production in $e^+e^-$ reactions. While covering a wide range of light NP scenarios, as specific case study we present a detailed discussion of a tauphilic gauge vector boson at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Primordial Dirac Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of Dirac leptogenesis based on the post-inflationary reheating phase of the early universe. An asymmetry generated within the scalar sector via CP-violating and out-of-equilibrium inflaton decays is transferred to chiral neutrinos through Yukawa interactions and then to baryons via electroweak sphalerons. We describe in detail a minimal realization of this mechanism that naturally accommodates small neutrino Yukawa couplings and results in contributions to the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, testable in upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the initial state of hydrodynamics in pp and pA collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of seeming hydrodynamic-like behavior in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions presents us with the conceptual problem of how the initial state of such a hydrodynamic evolution should be characterized. This is an issue because, while nuclei can reasonably be approximated as ``large'' systems w.r.t. the characteristic Fermi momentum of their constituents, this is no longer true for nucleons. Hence, one would need to match a ``quantum'' theory, whose observables are described via highly non-commuting operators, to a ``classical'' hydrodynamics. Operationally assuming a ``fast'' thermalization, we survey what kind of object is best suited to such a matching condition. We show that it cannot be any of the objects usually associated with ``the 3D structure of the nucleon'' but rather a measure associated with entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Probing Standard Model-like di-Higgs Production at Photon-Photon Colliders in the I(1+2)HDM Type-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, pair production of Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons, $hh$, is studied through $\gamma\gamma$ scattering at future electron-positron colliders, in the framework of the Inert Doublet Model with two Active Doublets, i.e., the I(1+2)HDM for short. The relevance of the process $\gamma\gamma\to hh$ for such a Beyond the SM (BSM) scenario stems from the fact that it is a one-loop process at lowest order, wherein inert charged states $\chi^\pm$ contribute alongside with $W^\pm$, $H^\pm$ and heavy fermions (primarily, bottom and top quarks), crucially, at the same perturbative order. {{Given that $\chi^\pm/H^\pm$ masses and $hS^+S^-$ ($S^\pm=\chi^\pm, H^\pm$) couplings are very mildly constrained,}} there exist regions of the parameter space of the I(1+2)HDM where the former can be rather light and the latter rather large. After imposing up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints on the I(1+2)HDM, it is found that the production rates of such process at future $\gamma\gamma$ machines can be enhanced up to a factor of $\approx$ $50$ with respect to the SM, significantly exceeding typical yields of conventional 2-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). Further, thanks to the level of control that one can attain at such facilities on the photon kinematics, leading to excellent invariant mass resolution of the incoming photon pairs, we show how it is possible to extract from this process the value of the $\chi^\pm$ mass (along that of the active $H^\pm$ states) with high precision, whichever the decays of the $hh$ pair, both with and without beam polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of flavor operate at various scales. Recently it has been pointed out that in the context of modular flavor symmetries certain combinations of observables are highly constrained, or even uniquely fixed, by modular invariance and holomorphicity. We find that even in the absence of supersymmetry these combinations are surprisingly immune against quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Validating a Machine Learning Approach to Identify Quenched Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using \textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape, which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish true quenching features.</description>

      <title>Decay and production properties of strange double charm pentaquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the decay and production properties of the strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ with strangeness $S=-1$. Building upon our previous work predicting its $J^P=1/2^-$ molecular configuration, we employ three-point QCD sum rules to calculate its strong decay widths and estimate its production branching ratios via $\Xi_{bc}^+$ baryon decays. The total strong decay width into the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and $\Omega_{cc}\pi$ final-state channels is determined as $84.58^{+19.25}_{-18.80}$ MeV. Furthermore, using a rescattering mechanism, we analyze the $\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D_s^{\ast-}\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++}$ process and estimate the production branching ratio to be $\mathcal{B}r(\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++})=(4.32_{-1.47}^{+2.02})\times10^{-6}$. The relatively narrow width and detectable branching ratio suggest that this pentaquark state could be observed in experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <title>Soft-contribution to thermal photon emission from chiral QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal photon emission rate from a chirally asymmetric quark gluon plasma using the Hard Thermal Loop approximation. The quasiparticle and plasmino modes prevalent at finite temperature split into L and R-modes in the presence of chiral imbalance and are found to disperse differently acquiring different thermal masses. The soft contribution to the thermal photon emission rate obtained from the retarded self-energy is found to contain additional terms proportional to the square of the quark and chiral chemical potentials which is found to cause an enhancement to thermal photon emission in the presence of chiral imbalance.</description>

      <title>Predictive one-zero with vanishing sub-trace texture in neutrino mass matrix in light of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a predictive class of neutrino mass matrices characterized by one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace within the framework of the scotogenic model, wherein neutrino masses, dark matter, and neutrinoless double beta decay are intrinsically correlated. We analyze twelve viable texture structures -- namely $B_{1,4,5}$, $C_{1,2,\ldots,5}$, $D_{4,5}$, and $F_{5,6}$ -- and examine their implications for the effective Majorana mass $(|M_{ee}|)$ governing neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$. Remarkably, all non-zero entries of the neutrino mass matrix can be parametrized in terms of this effective Majorana mass, establishing a direct theoretical link between low-energy observables and high-scale parameters of the model.Among the twelve textures, eleven predict dark matter masses of order TeV and yield correlated bounds on $|M_{ee}|$ -- making them testable in current and forthcoming $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments -- while the textures $D_4$ and $F_{5,6}$ exhibit comparatively weaker correlations. In contrast, the texture $C_5$ is excluded due to its requirement of unrealistically large Yukawa couplings and its inability to realize dark matter in the TeV regime. Our analysis thus identifies a subset of predictive neutrino mass textures that consistently relate dark matter phenomenology and neutrinoless double beta decay observables within the scotogenic paradigm.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conservation of $CP$ in QCD has been shown to follow from a careful treatment of the path integral and canonical quantization in arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747. Here, we refute the critique of these results put forth in arXiv:2510.18951. First, using the quantum rotor as an analogue of QCD, it is argued in arXiv:2510.18951 that the topological susceptibility vanishes when using the limiting procedure of arXiv:2001.07152. When translated to QCD, this would contradict the observed $\eta^\prime$-mass. We show that this is not the case because the susceptibility is defined from the vacuum correlator of the topological charge density, which for the rotor is just fixed by the canonical commutation relation. The latter does not depend on the disputed order of limits. Second, it is suggested in arXiv:2510.18951 that $CP$ violation in QCD can be established by considering the low-energy effective theory alone. We show that here the argument relies on assuming from the start choices of couplings that lead to $CP$ violation but are not of the most general form allowed by spurion analysis. No valid reason is given for why allowed choices leading to $CP$ conservation, that match the computation of ultraviolet correlators as shown in arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747, would be inconsistent.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}(x, Q^2)$ in momentum-space approach using the Block-Durand-Ha (BDH) parameterization of the proton structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$. The results are compared with H1 data and extended to high inelasticity. We also examine the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}(\frac{Q^2}{s}, Q^2)$ obtained at a fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$, comparing them with both the HERA data and the color dipole model bounds. These results and comparisons with HERA data demonstrate that the suggested method for the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}$ can be applied in analyses of the Large Hadron Collider and Future Circular Collider projects.</description>

      <title>Determination of quark-gluon-quark interference within the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass, $\gamma N \rightarrow N' M_1M_2$, in the framework of collinear factorisation. The mesons considered $M_1$ and $M_2$ are either pions or rho mesons, charged or neutral. We consider the kinematic regime characterised by a large invariant mass of the two-meson system, and a small deflection of the nucleon in the centre-of-mass frame. In this kinematic domain, the amplitude factorises into a perturbative hard part and non-perturbative parts described by Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Distribution Amplitudes (DAs). We automate the calculation of the fully differential cross section at leading twist and leading order, and we present some numerical results at JLab 12 GeV kinematics. This class of processes provides yet more exclusive $2 \to 3$ channels that can be used to extract GPDs.</description>

      <title>Emerging Narrow Resonance at 152 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC completed the Standard Model (SM), yet the possibility of additional scalars remains open, provided their contributions to electroweak symmetry breaking are sufficiently small. Recent analyses of LHC data have revealed statistically significant anomalies in multi-lepton final states - events characterized by multiple leptons, missing transverse energy, and ($b$-)jets. These anomalies provide intriguing hints of physics beyond the SM. In this work, we present the signature of growing excesses for a new scalar resonance with a mass of \(152 \pm 1\) GeV, observed in the \(\gamma\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\), and \(WW\) channels. The combined global significance reaches a level that points toward the growing signature of this resonance. The findings align with a simplified model in which a heavy scalar boson decays into two lighter scalars, thus providing a consistent framework explaining the observed multi-lepton anomalies.
  These results significantly advance the search for new scalar bosons at the electroweak scale. Future investigations, including precision studies with upcoming HL-LHC data, will be crucial for confirming the nature of this resonance and exploring its implications for extending the SM.</description>

      <title>Diboson production in the SMEFT at dimension-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of dimension-8 and dimension-6 effects in fully leptonic $WZ$ and $WW$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the Standard Model (SM) Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We focus on dimension-8 operators with maximal energy growth in the quark-(anti)quark-initiated production channel and assess their impact differentially through a variety of observables, including polarisation-sensitive ones. Leveraging existing data from measurements at the LHC, we perform fits to quantify the sensitivity of current and future data to dimension-8 effects and evaluate their interplay with squared dimension-6 contributions. By marginalising over the dimension-8 operators we examine the robustness of a dimension-6 SMEFT analysis in diboson production. We find that dimension-8 effects become subdominant only for new-physics scales above 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$ (kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992 MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ or $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta$. The latter process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta) / \sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0) \approx 9$. Due to the short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim 0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the available experimental data is obtained.</description>

      <title>Constraining the four-light quark operators in the SMEFT with multijet and VBF processes at linear level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the interference of the SM with ten four-light quark operators in the SMEFT can be constrained thanks to multijet and $Z,W,\gamma$ VBF production in association with jets. The differential distributions for each process are generated at LO for different jet multiplicities, that are then merged and showered. We check which observables provide better bounds on the Wilson coefficients, and what directions in the ten-dimensional coefficient space they are able to probe. We discuss the relevance of the quadratic contributions with respect to the linear terms.</description>

      <title>On the origin of CP symmetry violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments devoted to charge parity (CP) violation are normally interpreted by adjusting the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix to the measured violation parameters. However, the physical origin of these violations remains an open issue. To resolve this issue, the impact of Earth's gravity on meson oscillations is analysed. The effect of gravity is to couple flavour oscillations to quark zitterbewegung oscillations, and this coupling induces a superposition of CP eigenstates. The three types of CP violation effects result from this gravity-induced mixing. The three associated violation parameters are predicted in agreement with experimental data. The amplitude of the violation is linear with respect to gravity, so this new mechanism allows us to envisage cosmological evolutions that provide the observed baryonic asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum entanglement with Generalized Parton Distributions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the collinear factorization framework based on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), we calculate the spin density matrix of exclusively produced quark and antiquark pairs $u\bar{u}$, $d\bar{d}$, $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering. The presence of both real and imaginary parts in the GPD amplitudes leads to a rich pattern of entanglement between the quark and the antiquark. We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions. In strangeness, charm and bottom productions, the polarization can reach 50-80% in certain kinematic regions in the low-energy runs of the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model does not provide any dynamical explanation of the existence of different families of fermions. To account for this experimental fact, it just replicates three times its single-family gauge structure. The equal-charge fermions of the different families couple to the gauge bosons with exactly the same coupling strength. We overview the empirical evidence supporting this important property. The currently most precise experimental tests on the universality of the lepton and quark couplings are discussed. Both charged-current ($W^\pm$) and neutral-current ($Z$) interactions are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a well-motivated 3-Higgs doublet model, in which the extended dark sector accommodates CP violation, we analyse the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) at one- and two-loop order. We show the importance of higher loop calculations in EWPT analyses and identify the regions of the parameter space of our model where EWPT is of first order while in agreement with all theoretical and experimental bounds, including Dark Matter relic density and direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>Boson Stars Hosting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center. We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star. Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.</description>

      <title>String geometry phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a potential for string backgrounds is obtained from string geometry theory, which is a candidate for the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. By substituting a string phenomenological model with free parameters to the potential, one obtains a potential for the free parameters, whose minimum determines the free parameters. The model with the determined parameters is the ground state in the model. This will be the local minimum in a partial region of the model in the string theory landscape. By comparing it with the other local minimum, one can determine which model is near the minimum of the potential for string backgrounds, that will be the true vacuum in string theory, in the sense of the values of the potential. We will be able to find the true vacuum in string theory through a series of such researches. In this paper, we perform this analysis of a certain simple heterotic non-supersymmetric model explicitly, where the six-dimensional internal spaces are products of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvatures, and the generation number of massless fermions is given by the flux quantization numbers. As a result, we obtain a constraint between the compactification scale and the flux quanta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical predictions. Using two distinct photon detectors, we find that the data are well described by a sum of two exponential functions with lifetimes $\tau_1 = 1.7331 \pm 0.001$ ns and $\tau_2 = 5.948 \pm 0.012$ ns, in agreement with values reported in the literature. While no deviation from the exponential decay law is observed, this study serves as a reliable test for the experimental setup and enables a precise determination of the sample lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign at 11.5 GeV apparently results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Geometric Unification of Timelike Orbital Chaos and Phase Transitions in Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$ between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase transitions from a geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Classification of four-quark operators with $\Delta F\le 2$ under flavor symmetry and their renormalization in a gauge-invariant scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, with a particular emphasis on their renormalization within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). We focus on operators that do not mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation properties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\Delta F = 2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same irreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial subset of $\Delta F = 1$ and $\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis provides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants of GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing operators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing effects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three "free" parameters -- the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) -- give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance from quantum information principles</title>

Abstract: Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness, sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability. This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge invariance in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <title>The size of the quark-gluon plasma in ultracentral collisions: impact of initial density fluctuations on the average transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T\rangle$ of outgoing particles increases as a function of the particle multiplicity in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies. This increase was originally predicted on the basis of simulations where the multiplicity increase occurred at constant volume, so that it implied a larger density and temperature. However, recent state-of-the-art simulations have shown that, for some models of initial condition, the volume may vary with the multiplicity in ultracentral collisions. We elucidate this effect by analytically relating the variation of the volume to the radial distribution of the one- and two-point functions of the fluctuating density field. We show that the volume variation is small if the total entropy of the ultracentral collisions scales with the mass number of the colliding isotopes. We argue that probing detailed transverse distributions of initial-state fluctuations through the ultracentral $\langle p_T\rangle$ has nontrivial implications for models of nuclear structure and of the pre-equilibrium stages.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>Study on relativistic transformations for thermodynamic quantities: Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study derives the relativistic transformations of thermodynamic quantities from the Lorentz transformations applied to the four-momentum components of a thermodynamic system, which is stationary in the inertial reference frame $K_0$ and moves at constant velocity relative to the laboratory frame $K$. Thermodynamic variables are introduced into the formalism via the zeroth component of the four-momentum in $K_0$, representing the system's internal energy. By treating the three-momentum as an independent state variable, thermodynamic quantities are defined by differentiating the zeroth component of the four-momentum (the Hamiltonian) in the reference frame $K$ with respect to the independent state variables, yielding the fundamental thermodynamic potential. This approach results in the Non-Planck transformations, which differ from the Planck transformations by a factor of $\alpha$. In contrast, by adopting the three-velocity as an independent state variable, thermodynamic quantities are obtained by differentiating the negative Lagrangian, derived from the zeroth component of the four-momentum via Legendre transformations, with respect to the independent state variables, producing the conjugate fundamental thermodynamic potential. This yields the Planck transformations. Conversely, the Ott transformations are derived from the zeroth component of the four-momentum by treating velocity as an independent state variable. This approach conflicts with the principles of mechanics, resulting in an energy that does not qualify as a thermodynamic potential. To validate these findings, we analyze an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons within the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Furthermore, we develop consistent Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume freeze-out firecylinders in heavy ion collisions, incorporating Planck and Ott transformations.</description>

      <title>Supernova bounds on new scalars from resonant and soft emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supernova cooling constraints on new light scalars that mix with the Higgs, couple only to nucleons, or couple only to leptons. We show that in all these cases scalars with masses smaller than the plasma frequency in the supernova core are efficiently produced by resonant mixing with the in-medium longitudinal degree of freedom of the photon. The resulting bounds are free from uncertainties associated to the rate of emission of the scalar in nucleon-nucleon scatterings, which would otherwise badly affect the Higgs-mixed and nucleophilic scenarios. Heavier scalars that mix with the Higgs or couple only to nucleons are mostly produced by nucleon bremsstrahlung, and we obtain a conservative approximation for the corresponding rate using a soft theorem. We also analyse the impact of different supernova profiles, nucleon degeneracy, trapping and scalar decays on the constraints.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass from wash-in leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is an attractive scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that relies on the dynamics of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) in the seesaw extension of the Standard Model. In standard thermal leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale $M_N$ is subject to the Davidson--Ibarra bound, $M_N \gtrsim 10^9\,\textrm{GeV}$, which builds on the assumption that RHN decays are responsible for the violation of both charge-parity invariance ($CP$) and baryon-minus-lepton number ($B\!-\!L$). In this paper, we relax this assumption in the context of the more flexible framework of wash-in leptogenesis, in which $CP$ violation is encoded in the initial conditions and the only remaining task of the RHN decays is to violate $B\!-\!L$. Solving the relevant set of Boltzmann equations for vanishing initial baryon and lepton numbers (i.e., $B = L_e = L_\mu = L_\tau = 0$ initially), we find that, in wash-in leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale can be as low as 7~TeV. Wash-in leptogenesis at such low RHN masses requires the presence of a primordial charge asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons. We discuss several possibilities for the origin of such an asymmetry and comment on its implications for the chiral instability of the Standard Model plasma.</description>

Abstract: Axion cosmology needs the QCD topological susceptibility between 400 and 1100 MeV. In this range the bottom quark is inconvenient to include in lattice simulations, but not heavy enough to ignore. We estimate its effect on the susceptibility by computing the ratio of the 4-quark susceptibility and the 4+1-quark susceptibility in the caloron gas approximation. We do so by computing small-mass and large-mass expansions of the finite mass and temperature fluctuation determinant and connecting them with a Pad\'e approximant.</description>

      <title>Attractive features of Higgsino Dark Matter in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Higgsino dark matter (DM) scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the mixing of Gaugino and Higgsino influences the mass splitting between neutralinos predominantly composed of Higgsino and introduces coupling between the DM and Higgs bosons. These effects modify the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, causing conflicts with the latest direct detection results from LZ experiments for both substantial and minute mixings. Consequently, the experimental measurement of DM relic density necessitates the Higgsino DM mass to be approximately 1.1 TeV. We discovered that in the Higgsino DM scenario of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM), the mixing of Higgsino and Singlino introduces analogous effects, with a crucial distinction being that the current LZ experiment permits significant mixing between Singlino and Higgsino. This pronounced mixing effect effectively attenuates the interactions between Higgsino-dominated neutralinos and standard model particles, enabling DM masses exceeding roughly 670 GeV to achieve the correct relic abundance. Through analytical formulas and numerical results, we elucidated these characteristics which were not observed before. Our research reveals that in the NMSSM, when comprehensively examining the mixing effects of Higgsino, Gaugino, and Singlino, the properties of Higgsino DM become markedly more intricate compared to the MSSM predictions.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Low-Energy Weak Mixing Angle with Supernova Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ is a fundamental parameter in the electroweak theory with a value running according to the energy scale, and its precision measurement in the low-energy regime is still ongoing. We propose a method to measure the low-energy $\sin{^2\theta_W}$ by taking advantage of Argo, a future ton-scale liquid argon dark matter detector, and the neutrino flux from a nearby core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We evaluate the expected precision of this measurement through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. We show that Argo is potentially capable of achieving a few percent determination of $\sin{^2\theta_W}$, at the momentum transfer of $q \sim 20$ MeV, in the observation of a CCSN within $\sim 3$ kpc from the Earth. Such a measurement is valuable for both the precision test of the electroweak theory and searching for new physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Radiative Symmetry Breaking with a Scale Invariant Seesaw</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a scale invariant inverse seesaw model that radiatively generates the electroweak scale, the Standard Model (SM) neutrino masses, and stabilizes the electroweak vacuum. Previous studies have noted that the SM Higgs potential and the electroweak scale can be radiatively generated via the minimal seesaw mechanism. This scenario, called the ``Neutrino Option'', was UV-completed by a scale invariant framework. However, these models predict singlet neutrino and scalar masses at $10^7-10^9$ GeV, beyond any experimental reach and leave the electroweak vacuum meta/un-stable at high energies. In this work, we propose modifications to this framework that lower the singlet neutrino masses to experimentally accessible scales through an inverse seesaw mechanism, while fully stabilizing the electroweak vacuum with an additional singlet scalar. The possibility of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis is also explored.</description>

Abstract: The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable, particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments, especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime. VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect detection of thermal relic DM.</description>

Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the proton encodes fundamental information about its mass, pressure, and shear distributions. Using recent lattice QCD data for the gravitational form factors, we show that the Breit-frame Wigner EMT may be of Hawking-Ellis type IV in the proton's core. Such EMT violates all pointwise energy conditions and lacks a causal rest frame so that the usual mechanical picture fails at short distances. We define the gravitational radius -- a new hadronic observable marking the scale where the EMT becomes ordinary (type I) and the classical interpretation is restored. We also derive from the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC) non-perturbative, model-independent QFT constraints on gravitational form factors.</description>

Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies of the muon magnetic moment indicate the absence of the previously reported discrepancy, providing a vital opportunity to constrain potential BSM physics. In this work, we explore the MeV-GeV mass range, where existing exclusion limits remain relatively loose. We analyze both scalar and pseudoscalar as well as vector and axial vector mediators. We demonstrate that the new bounds are not only comparable to - but in several cases, significantly more stringent than - the constraints obtained from previous collider experiments, even when near-future projections are considered.</description>

      <title>Charm rescattering in $B^0\to K^0\bar{\ell}\ell$: an improved analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve upon previous explicit estimates of charm rescattering contributions to the decay $B^0\to K^0\bar{\ell}\ell$ by including contributions from dipole interactions with the intermediate charm-meson states, and by further investigating the structure of the electromagnetic form factors. Using a model of fundamental meson fields inspired by heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, augmented by form factors motivated by theoretical considerations as well as experimental data, we provide a thorough investigation of rescattering contributions induced by intermediate $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high-energy electron-positron annihilation are promising systems for the study of quantum information properties. In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.</description>

      <title>Exploring rapidity regularization schemes at low $x$ with the DIS longitudinal structure function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose three possible rapidity regulators for higher-order calculations in low $x$ QCD with gluon saturation, as alternatives to the usual lower cut-off for the integrals over the light-cone momentum $k^+$. These rapidity regulators are closely related to the $\eta$ regulator and to the pure rapidity regulator, which have been used primarily in studies of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization within the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). By choosing one of the three rapidity regulators that we propose, formulated in terms of $k^+$, $k^-$ or rapidity respectively, one can set from the start of the calculation in which of these three variables one wishes to formulate the low $x$ evolution equations, which is one of the main advantages of our approach.
  As a test of the viability of these rapidity regulators and of their practical implementation in higher order calculations with gluon saturation effects, we use them to revisit the calculation of the NLO corrections to the dipole factorization of the $F_L$ structure function in inclusive DIS at low $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$ within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (HCQM). The ground state masses of the involved baryons are evaluated by numerically solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, incorporating both hyper-Coulomb and linear confinement potentials along with spin-dependent interactions. The Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory (HQET) form factors are computed up to the subleading order, incorporating $1/m_Q$ corrections that account for finite mass effects beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit. These form factors are then employed to analyse the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rate via helicity formalism. Our results for the decay width and branching ratio are compared with those from various theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Possible mixing between elementary and bound state fields in the $t\bar{t}$ production excess at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium $(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\ (-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$ contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta + \eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 13^{\circ}$ for the minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of 2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.</description>

      <title>Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.</description>

Abstract: While most studies of the minimal type-I seesaw neglect the heaviest decoupled right-handed neutrino, assuming negligible contributions to neutrino masses and leptogenesis, we demonstrate that its cosmological role can be significant. When long-lived, the presence of this particle can substantially modify the charged lepton Yukawa equilibration temperature in the early universe, necessitating reassessment of lepton flavor effects in thermal leptogenesis and potentially shifting flavor regime boundaries. Additionally, we identify experimental probes, including neutrino oscillation measurements and gravitational wave observations to investigate this scenario.</description>

      <title>Dijets with large rapidity separation at the next-to-leading BFKL for search of large extra dimension gravity at colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search for the gravity with large extra dimensions at collider energies is considered in the trans-Planckian eikonal regime, i. e., when $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D \gg \sqrt{-\hat{t}}$. Here $\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$ are the Mandelstam variables of colliding parton-parton system and $M_D$ is the Planck mass scale in the space-time with compactified $n_D$ extra dimensions. A relevant observable for this regime may be the cross section of high-mass ($M_{jj}\sim\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D$) dijet production with large rapidity separation. Then the standard model (SM) background should be calculated within the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximation of Lipatov-Fadin-Kuraev-Balitsky (BFKL) formalism of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) suitable for $\sqrt{\hat{s}}\gg\sqrt{-\hat{t}}\gg\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$. In this work the signal of the large extra dimension gravity as well as the NLL BFKL QCD background are estimated for the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and future colliders such as FCCpp and CEPC-SppC.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 5.6 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrisation do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 25\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} &gt; \max[105 M_\odot/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_\odot)^{-0.09}]$ of DM.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\bar{\mu}$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands and focusing on the $n = 1$ lensing band, we illustrate by which diagnostics a modified light propagation may be distinguished from a modified spacetime geometry and how constraints on the value of the non-minimal coupling can be obtained</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. Our results are consistent at the $\sim 1.5-2\sigma$ level with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, as well as with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior and a Planck prior on $n_s$. The shift in the posterior compared to DES collaboration results highlights the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</description>
