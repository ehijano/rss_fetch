      <title>Stable hopfions in trapped quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopfions are a class of three-dimensional (3D) solitons which are built as vortex tori carrying intrinsic twist of the toroidal core. They are characterized by two independent topological charges, \textit{viz}., vorticity $S$ and winding number $M$ of the intrinsic twist, whose product determines the \textit{Hopf number}, $Q_{H}=MS$, which is the basic characteristic of the hopfions. We construct hopfions as solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) for Bose-Einstein condensates in binary atomic gases. The GPE system includes the cubic mean-field self-attraction, competing with the quartic self-repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, which represents effects of quantum fluctuations around the mean-field state, and a trapping toroidal potential (TP). A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of the states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner TP\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with $S=1,M=1\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\sim 7$, also form partly stable families, including the case of the LHY\ superfluid, in which the nonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the hopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only the mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure of the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$, circles which represent the \textit{preimage} of the full state do not intersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose number is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal structures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.</description>

      <title>Suppression of capillary instability in a confined quantum liquid filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Bose-Bose mixtures with strong attraction can form self-bound, liquid-like droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Despite equilibrium densities much lower than those of classical liquids, these droplets exhibit finite surface tension and liquid-like behaviors. Recent experiments have demonstrated Rayleigh-Plateau instability in elongated droplets confined in an optical waveguide. Here we consider the case of an infinite filament and extend the theoretical description to include transverse harmonic confinement. By solving the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations within a single-component framework, benchmarked against full Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we show that increasing confinement progressively suppresses the instability, leading to complete stabilization beyond a critical trap frequency.</description>

      <title>Effects of Small-Chain Superexchange Dynamics on Spin-Orbit Coupled Clock Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy. Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$ atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock performance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Higher spin Richardson-Gaudin model with time-dependent coupling: Exact dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary $s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Hawking time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.</description>

      <title>Localization Transition for Interacting Quantum Particles in Colored-Noise Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition of interacting particles in a one-dimensional correlated disorder system. The disorder which we investigate allows for vanishing backwards scattering processes. We derive by two renormalization group procedures its phase diagram and predict that the localization transition point is shifted from finite attractive interaction to the non-interacting point. We finally show numerically that the scaling of the localization length with the disorder strength deviates from the usual scaling of a localized phase.</description>

      <title>Metrology using atoms in an array of double-well potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects, such as entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell correlations, can enhance metrological sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. These correlations are typically generated through interactions between atoms or molecules, or during the passage of a laser pulse through a birefringent crystal. Here, we consider an alternative method of generating scalable, many-body entangled states, and demonstrate their usability for quantum-enhanced metrology. Our setup is a one-dimensional (1D) array of double-well potentials holding independent and uncorrelated Bose-Einstein condensates. The beam-splitting transformation mixes the signal between adjacent wells and yields a strongly entangled state through a many-body equivalent of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We demonstrate this entanglement can improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In our analysis, we account for the effects of atomic fluctuations and identify the optimal measurement that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.</description>

      <title>A magneto-optical trap of silver and potassium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual magneto-optical trap of $^{109}$Ag and $^{39}$K. For silver, a decreasing-field Zeeman slower loads a MOT of $1.5{\times}10^8$ atoms at a temperature of 0.74(5) mK, with laser cooling occurring primarily on the $D_2$ line of $4d^{10}5s\; {}^2S_{1/2}\rightarrow 5p\; {}^2P_{3/2}$ at 328 nm. We create a novel Ag "dark spot MOT," where shelving the atoms in a dark state enhances the captured atom number by a factor of two and the lifetime by a factor of four. For potassium, we obtain $2{\times}10^8$ trapped atoms, and further cooling on the $D_1$ transition via grey molasses results in a cloud of $1.2{\times} 10^8$ atoms at 7(1) $\mu$K. We observe evidence of photoionization loss of the K MOT in the presence of Ag laser-cooling light, with implications for optimal dual species loading strategies. Our results on Ag point to simple and general laser cooling strategies for other coinage metals (Au, Cu). Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the production of alkali-coinage metal degenerate quantum mixtures and highly polar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic gases confined to a ring geometry. Our study, conducted at zero temperature using time-dependent density functional theory, cover interaction regimes from strong (unitary Fermi gas) to weak (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime) couplings. Stability is tested against the presence of an external defect within the ring. The dissipation mechanism associated with vortex generation is present in all interaction regimes. Vortex emission is accompanied by Cooper pair breaking, which occurs even beyond the vortex core in the weakly interacting regime. The pair-breaking mechanism prevents the imprinting of a persistent current with a winding number above a threshold, which decreases as the system approach the BCS regime. Our study reveals the existence of two types of critical winding numbers above which currents cease to be persistent in Fermi superfluids: one related to the proliferation of quantum vortices and the other to the onset of the pair-breaking mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan \textit{et al.} [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023267}{Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)}] and Chen \textit{et al.} [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013226}{Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)}], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Strongly Repulsive 1D Gases at Higher Branches: Spin-Charge Correlation and Coupled Spin-Chain Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the higher repulsive branches of one-dimensional (1D) bosonic and fermionic quantum gases beyond the super-Tonks-Girardeau regime, utilizing the Bethe-Ansatz method and exact diagonalization of small trapped clusters. In contrast to the well-studied lowest branches that are characterized by spin-charge separation, we demonstrate the emergence of strong spin-charge correlation in all higher branches with hard-core interactions. This manifests in distinct quasi-momentum distributions and energy spectra for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, despite their fermionization. Furthermore, trapped fermions in higher branches exhibit novel spin textures, intricately linked to charge excitations, necessitating a coupled multi-chain description beyond single effective spin-chain models. Our findings unveil a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in highly excited 1D systems, opening avenues for exploring novel quantum phenomena beyond the conventional paradigm of low-lying states.</description>

      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>
