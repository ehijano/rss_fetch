      <title>Formal justification of a continuum relaxation model for one-dimensional moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical relaxation in moir\'e materials is often modeled by a continuum model where linear elasticity is coupled to a stacking penalty known as the Generalized Stacking Fault Energy (GSFE). We review and compute minimizers of a one-dimensional version of this model, and then show how it can be formally derived from a natural atomistic model. Specifically, we show that the continuum model emerges in the limit $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ and $\delta \downarrow 0$ while holding the ratio $\eta := \frac{\epsilon^2}{\delta}$ fixed, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the monolayer lattice constant to the moir\'e lattice constant and $\delta$ is the ratio of the typical stacking energy to the monolayer stiffness.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. Such highest weight vectors arise as partition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the representations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators $ \omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion'' formula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectral curve with $ \hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction, starting from an $\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied. When this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the shifted topological recursion obtained earlier.</description>

      <title>Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the advantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic equations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial correlations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of active soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collective behavior of living creatures.</description>

      <title>The complete non-perturbative partition function of minimal superstring theory and JT supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact convergent expression for the partition function of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ $(2,4k)$ minimal superstring theory with type 0B GSO projection in the ungapped phase by leveraging the duality between this theory and a double-scaled unitary matrix integral. Taking the $k\rightarrow\infty$ limit, we also obtain the complete partition function of $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, including all contributions associated with ``doubly non-perturbative'' effects. We discover that the fundamental objects of the string theory are a linear combination of the standard FZZT branes which we call F-branes, along with their charge-conjugate partners which we call anti-F-branes. Summing over the disk and cylinder diagram contributions of the F-branes and anti-F-branes and integrating over their moduli space completely reproduces our expression for the partition function from the matrix integral side of the duality. We show that the string theory can be expressed precisely in the formalism of dressed free fermions and we propose a Hilbert space interpretation of our results. We present exact expressions for the matrix integral correlators of the double-scaled eigenvalue density $\widetilde{\rho}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Exploring superconformal Yang-Mills theories through matrix Bessel kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broad class of observables in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be exactly computed for arbitrary 't Hooft coupling as Fredholm determinants of integrable Bessel operators. These observables admit a unifying description through a one-parameter generating function, which possesses a determinant representation involving a matrix generalization of the Bessel operator. We analyze this generating function over a wide range of parameter values and finite 't Hooft coupling. We demonstrate that it has a well-behaved weak-coupling expansion with a finite radius of convergence. In contrast, the strong-coupling expansion exhibits factorially growing coefficients, necessitating the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections that are exponentially suppressed at strong coupling. We compute these non-perturbative corrections and observe a striking resemblance between the resulting trans-series expansion of the generating function and the partition function of a strongly coupled theory expanded in powers of a mass gap.</description>

      <title>A single geometry from an all-genus expansion in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an instance in quantum gravity where a topological expansion resums into an effective description on a single geometry. The original theory whose gravitational path integral we study is JT quantum gravity with one asymptotic boundary at nonperturbatively low temperatures. The effective theory we derive is a deformation of JT gravity by a highly quantum and nonlocal interaction for the dilaton, evaluated only on a disk topology. This emergent description addresses a strongly quantum gravitational regime where all genera contribute at the same order, successfully capturing the doubly nonperturbative physics of the original theory.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. A Wilsonian renormalisation group analysis determines a universal profile for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. With free boundary conditions, the universal scaling applies at a pseudocritical point.</description>

      <title>Parity symmetry breaking of spin-$j$ coherent state superpositions in Gaussian noise channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner function and Wigner-Yanase skew information are connected through quantum coherence. States with high skew information often exhibit more pronounced negative regions in their Wigner functions, indicative of quantum interference and non-classical behavior. Thus, the relationship between these two concepts is that states with high quantum coherence tend to display more non-classical features in their Wigner functions. By exploiting this relationship, which manifests as parity symmetry and asymmetry, we analyze parity symmetry and asymmetry in the superposition of two spin coherent states for a spin-$1/2$, as well as for a general spin-$j$. This analysis shows that the preservation of the parity asymmetry, or the violation of the parity symmetry, correlates with an increase in the value of spin $j$. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of parity symmetry and asymmetry of these states subjected to a Gaussian noise channel. Specifically, we examine how this parity symmetry and asymmetry change and identify the points at which parity symmetry is violated in the spin-$1/2$ cat state. Notably, the violation of parity symmetry becomes more pronounced at higher values of the decoherence parameter $s$. Our study shows how the spin value $j$ affects the breaking of parity symmetry in general spin-$j$ cat states that are hit by Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural, mathematically consistent definition of the essential (highest possible) regularity of an affine connection -- a geometric property independent of atlas -- together with a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether connections are at their essential regularity. This condition is based on the relative regularity between the connection and its Riemann curvature. Based on this, we prove that authors' theory of the RT-equations provides a computable procedure for constructing coordinate transformations which simultaneously lift connection and curvature components to essential regularity, and lift the atlas of coordinate charts to the regularity required to preserve the essential regularity of the connection. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in a geometry are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. The theory applies to general affine connections with components in $L^p$, $p&gt;n$, which naturally includes shock wave singularities in General Relativity as well as continuous metrics with infinite gradients, (both obstacles to numerical simulation), but not yet singularities at the lower regularity $p\leq n$ associated with discontinuous metric components, for example, the event horizon of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and critical behavior in hierarchical integer-valued Gaussian and Coulomb gas models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a square box $\Lambda_n\subseteq\mathbb Z^2$ of side-length $L^n$ with $L,n&gt;1$, we study hierarchical random fields $\{\phi_x\colon x\in\Lambda_n\}$ with law proportional to ${\rm e}^{\frac12\beta(\varphi,\Delta_n\phi)}\prod_{x\in\Lambda_n}\nu({\rm d}\phi_x)$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta_n$ is a hierarchical Laplacian on $\Lambda_n$, and $\nu$ is a non-degenerate $1$-periodic measure on $\mathbb R$. Our setting includes the integer-valued Gaussian field (a.k.a. DG-model or Villain Coulomb gas) and the sine-Gordon model. Relying on renormalization group analysis we derive sharp asymptotic formulas, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, for the covariance $\langle\phi_x\phi_y\rangle$ and the fractional charge $\langle{\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i}\alpha(\phi_x-\phi_y)}\rangle$ in the subcritical $\beta&lt;\beta_{\rm c}:=\pi^2/\log L$, critical $\beta=\beta_{\rm c}$ and slightly supercritical $\beta&gt;\beta_{\rm c}$ regimes. The field exhibits logarithmic correlations throughout albeit with a distinct $\beta$-dependence of the variance and fractional-charge exponents in the sub/supercritical regimes. Explicit logarithmic corrections appear at the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish a version of the Bartnik Splitting Conjecture in the context of Lorentzian length spaces. In precise terms, we show that under an appropriate timelike completeness condition, a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length space of the form $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}$ with $\Sigma$ compact splits as a metric Lorentzian product, provided it has non negative timelike curvature bounds. This is achieved by showing that the causal boundary of that Lorentzian length space consists on a single point.</description>

Abstract: Operator formulations of classical Kepler and harmonic oscillator problems in 2-dimensions are shown to be equivalent. We construct classical Hamiltonian operators and classical wavefunctions corresponding to these systems, using plane polar coordinates. The Schr\"{o}dinger like equation written in terms of these classical Hamiltonian operator and corresponding classical wavefunction describing former system are mapped to that of latter by Levi-Civita map and reparameterization of time(Sundman map).</description>

      <title>Boundaries of the sets of quantum realizable values of arbitrary order Bargmann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the latest developments within the field of quantum information science, Bargmann invariants have emerged as fundamental quantities, uniquely characterizing tuples of quantum states while remaining invariant under unitary transformations. However, determining the boundaries of quantum-realizable values for Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order remains a significant theoretical challenge. In this work, we completely solve this problem by deriving a unified boundary formulation for these values. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore the constraints imposed by quantum mechanics to delineate the achievable ranges of these invariants. We demonstrate that the boundaries depend on the specific properties of quantum states and the order of the Bargmann invariants, illustrated by a family of single-parameter qubit pure states. Our findings uncover intricate connections between Bargmann invariants and quantum imaginarity, offering a unified perspective on the associated boundary curves. These results enhance our understanding of the physical limits within quantum mechanics and may lead to novel applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems with momentum-dependent mass: Isochronicity and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Harish-Chandra transform and infinitesimal freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last ten years a technique of Schur generating functions and Harish-Chandra transforms was developed for the study of the asymptotic behavior of discrete particle systems and random matrices. In the current paper we extend this toolbox in several directions. We establish general results which allow to access not only the Law of Large Numbers, but also next terms of the asymptotic expansion of averaged empirical measures. In particular, this allows to obtain an analog of a discrete Baik-Ben Arous-Peche phase transition. A connection with infinitesimal free probability is shown and a quantized version of infinitesimal free probability is introduced. Also, we establish the Law of Large Numbers for several new regimes of growth of a Harish-Chandra transform.</description>

Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian Schur processes and last passage percolation in a half-quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:1606.00525v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study last passage percolation in a half-quadrant, which we analyze within the framework of Pfaffian Schur processes. For the model with exponential weights, we prove that the fluctuations of the last passage time to a point on the diagonal are either GSE Tracy-Widom distributed, GOE Tracy-Widom distributed, or Gaussian, depending on the size of weights along the diagonal. Away from the diagonal, the fluctuations of passage times follow the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also obtain a two-dimensional crossover between the GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of last passage times close to the diagonal when the size of the diagonal weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point. We expect that this crossover arises universally in KPZ growth models in half-space. Along the way, we introduce a method to deal with diverging correlation kernels of point processes where points collide in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Facilitated exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Facilitated TASEP, an interacting particle system on the one dimensional integer lattice. We prove that starting from step initial condition, the position of the rightmost particle has Tracy Widom GSE statistics on a cube root time scale, while the statistics in the bulk of the rarefaction fan are GUE. This uses a mapping with last-passage percolation in a half-quadrant which is exactly solvable through Pfaffian Schur processes.
  Our results further probe the question of how first particles fluctuate for exclusion processes with downward jump discontinuities in their limiting density profiles. Through the Facilitated TASEP and a previously studied MADM exclusion process we deduce that cube-root time fluctuations seem to be a common feature of such systems. However, the statistics which arise are shown to be model dependent (here they are GSE, whereas for the MADM exclusion process they are GUE).
  We also discuss a two-dimensional crossover between GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of the first particles when the rate of the first one varies. In terms of half-space last passage percolation, this corresponds to last passage times close to the boundary when the size of the boundary weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) initiated the study of focusing Gibbs measures, which was continued by Brydges and Slade (1996), Bourgain (1997, 1999), and Carlen, Fr\"ohlich, and Lebowitz (2016) among others. In this paper, we complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Hartree Gibbs measures in the three-dimensional setting. More precisely, we study a focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity, where the potential for the Hartree nonlinearity is given by the Bessel potential of order $\beta$. We first construct the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$, while we prove its non-normalizability for $\beta &lt; 2$. Furthermore, we establish the following phase transition at the critical value $\beta = 2$: normalizability in the weakly nonlinear regime and non-normalizability in the strongly nonlinear regime. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure, namely, the three-dimensional stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation (SdNLW) with a cubic nonlinearity of Hartree-type, forced by an additive space-time white noise, and prove almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$ (and $\beta = 2$ in the weakly nonlinear regime). In view of the non-normalizability result, our almost sure global well-posedness result is sharp. In Appendix, we also discuss the (parabolic) stochastic quantization for the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure.
  We also construct the defocusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^3_3$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ill-posedness issue for the cubic nonlinear heat equation and prove norm inflation with infinite loss of regularity in the H\"older-Besov space $\mathcal C^s = B^{s}_{\infty, \infty}$ for $ s \le -\frac 23$. In particular, our result includes the subcritical range $-1&lt; s \le -\frac 23$, which is above the scaling critical regularity $s = -1$ with respect to the H\"older-Besov scale. In view of the well-posedness result in $\mathcal C^s$, $s &gt; -\frac 23$, our ill-posedness result is sharp.</description>

      <title>On the deep-water and shallow-water limits of the intermediate long wave equation from a statistical viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with the depth parameter $\delta &gt; 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$) and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view. In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \infty$. As they are supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW. We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that, as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $P(\Phi)_2$-model on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <title>Uncoiled affine Temperley-Lieb algebras and their Wenzl-Jones projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine and periodic Temperley-Lieb algebras are families of diagrammatic algebras that find diverse applications in mathematics and physics. These algebras are infinite dimensional, yet most of their interesting modules are finite. In this paper, we introduce finite quotients for these algebras, which we term uncoiled affine Temperley-Lieb algebras and uncoiled periodic Temperley-Lieb algebras. We study some of their properties, including their defining relations, their description with diagrams, their dimensions, and their relation with affine and sandwich cellular algebras. The uncoiled algebras all have finitely many one-dimensional modules. We construct a family of Wenzl-Jones idempotents, each of which projects onto one of these one-dimensional modules. Our construction is explicit and uses the similar projectors for the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebras, as well as the diagrammatic description of the uncoiled algebras in terms of sandwich diagrams. We also discuss the Markov traces for the uncoiled algebras and their evaluations on the newly defined projectors, and find expressions involving Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argued in the paper "Geometry from Donaldson-Thomas invariants" that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should define a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions. In this paper we show how to associate a generating function to these geometric structures which we call the tau function. In the case of the derived category of the resolved conifold, this function reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function introduced in the paper "Riemann-Hilbert problems for the resolved conifold". In the case of the derived category of the A2 quiver it is the Painleve I tau function. The definition of the tau-function depends on certain choices of additional data which we discuss in the paper. There is still much to understand!</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Definition of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and compute its generalised partition functions exactly using methods of stochastic analysis. Our results rigorously implement an approach by Belokurov--Shavgulidze. The Schwarzian Field Theory has attracted recent attention due to its role in the analysis of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model and as the proposed holographic dual to Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from the probability measure.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory at low temperatures. We demonstrate that the good rate function is equal to the action of the Schwarzian Field Theory, and we find its minimisers. In addition, we define an analogue of the H\"{o}lder condition on the functional space $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ in terms of cross-ratio observables, characterise them in terms of the usual H\"{o}lder property on the space of continuous functions, and deduce the corresponding compact embedding theorem. We also show that the Schwarzian measure concentrates on functions satisfying the defined condition.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Correlation Functions of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov "type-D" spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Slow Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal (Gibbs) states is a common task in physics and computer science. Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the cost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like algorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum systems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising model and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization of these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in quantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous to the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and quantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.
  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the mixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low temperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers also have $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$. This applies to models like random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we provide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n)]$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low constant temperature. Finally, we consider constant-degree classical Hamiltonians and show how to lift classical slow mixing results in the presence of a transverse field using Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques. We show generic results for models with linear free energy barriers, and we demonstrate that our techniques extend to models with sublinear free energy barriers by proving $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[n^{1/2-o(1)}]$ for the ferromagnetic 2D transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which is controlled in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. This provides analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a hidden aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\ $the dynamics of the dilaton can be used to induce variations in Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$. This mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes offers novel insights into the origin of late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two explicit expressions for generic singular vectors of type $(r,s)$ of the Virasoro algebra. These results follow from the paper of Bauer et al which presented recursive methods to construct the vectors. The expressions presented here generalise the results of Benoit-Saint Aubin for the type $(1,s)$ singular vectors in two different ways: the first simply solves the recursion through the use of partitions; the second gives explicit formulae for the coefficients in a particular expansion. A Mathematica notebook is available which implements the formulae.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formulation for Energy Loss, Collision Rate, and Entropy Evolution in Collisionless and Collisional Plasmas: Transition from Maxwellian to Non-Maxwellian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalised Hamiltonian formulation to model the collision rate, energy loss, entropy evolution, and the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions in a plasma. By incorporating gyrokinetic turbulence and the effects of collisions, we derive a Hamiltonian that captures both the collisionless and collisional dynamics of a plasma. The formulation accounts for entropy production, energy transport, and the resulting changes in plasma confinability. We show how entropy increase during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian states impacts fusion efficiency and plasma stability. Finally, we provide a mathematical proof that links entropy evolution to energy loss and the emergent properties of confinement.</description>
