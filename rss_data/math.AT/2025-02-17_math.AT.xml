      <title>Classification of Temporal Graphs using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs effectively model dynamic systems by representing interactions as timestamped edges. However, analytical tools for temporal graphs are limited compared to static graphs. We propose a novel method for analyzing temporal graphs using Persistent Homology. Our approach leverages $\delta$-temporal motifs (recurrent subgraphs) to capture temporal dynamics %without aggregation
  . By evolving these motifs, we define the \textit{average filtration} and compute PH on the associated clique complex. This method captures both local and global temporal structures and is stable with respect to reference models. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the temporal graph classification task. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach, achieving over 92\% accuracy, with some cases reaching 100\%. Unlike existing methods that require node classes, our approach is node class free, offering flexibility for a wide range of temporal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>Boundary framings for locally conformally symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a rational homotopy-theoretic model for a classifying space of locally conformally symplectic structures on four-manifolds, and use it to definition a cobordism category of three-manifolds `anchored' by principal $\Omega^2 S^2$ - bundles (\S 2, generalizing contact structures). Powerful sl_2 - representation-valued Hodge-Lefschetz cohomology (going back to Chern and Weil), taking values in the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded category of bidifferential modules of Angella, Otiman, and Tardini is available for its study.
  \S3 observes that Ebin's configuration groupoid [Metrics/Dif] for Euclidean general relativity can be represented (cohomologically over $\mathbb{Q}$) in terms of a category of objects (or `aspects') of $X$ (as a space, under the action of its group of (pointed, etc) diffeomorphisms). This provides a notational system for the higher category of actions of compact connected groups $K$ on $X$, which is classically accessible by Atiyah-Bott/Duistermaat-Heckmann localisation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <title>Cohomological characterisation of hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.</description>
