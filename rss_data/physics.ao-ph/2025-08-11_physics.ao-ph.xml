      <title>Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</description>

      <title>A historical record of four black rainstorm episodes in Hong Kong, China in July to August 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four episodes of black rainstorms, the highest tier of heavy rain according to the rainstorm warning system in Hong Kong, occurred within eight days from 29 July to 5 August 2025, breaking the record for torrential rain in the territory. Providing early alerts to the public about these black rainstorms has considerable application value and has a substantial impact on their lives. This initial review of the four black rainstorm cases focuses on the predictability of the events from the synoptic/mesoscale to the micro/storm scale. A newly available tool for three-dimensional wind fields retrieved from weather radars in the region was used to analyse the triggering factors for the development and maintenance of intense convection. Given the current level of technology, the four episodes of heavy rain had different degrees of predictability. Global artificial intelligence (AI) models were found to be skilful in capturing two major rainstorms, including one week before they occurred. Surface convergence, mid-tropospheric waves, and jets were important mechanisms in heavy rainfall occurrence. Future research directions on these black rainstorms have been briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>

      <title>Taking the Garbage Out of Data-Driven Prediction Across Climate Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) -- and specifically machine learning (ML) -- applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism "garbage in, garbage out." As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameterisation: the importance of nonlocality and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic parameterisations deployed in models of the Earth system frequently invoke locality assumptions such as Markovianity or spatial locality. This work highlights the impact of such assumptions on predictive performance. Both in terms of short-term forecasting and the representation of long-term statistics, we find locality assumptions to be detrimental in idealised experiments. We show, however, that judicious choice of Markovian parameterisation can mitigate errors due to assuming Markovianity. We propose a simple modification to standard Markovian parameterisations, which yields significant improvements in predictive skill while reducing computational cost. We further note a divergence between configurations of a parameterisation which perform best in short-term prediction and those which best represent time-invariant statistics.</description>
