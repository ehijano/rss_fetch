      <title>CFD-Based Quantification of Hemodynamic Variables in Cerebral Aneurysms: How Hemodynamics Shape Aneurysm Fate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms are pathological dilations of intracranial arteries that can rupture with devastating consequences, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and death. Accumulating evidence indicates that local hemodynamic forces play a critical role in aneurysm initiation, growth, and rupture. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and imaging-based techniques have enabled the extraction of various hemodynamic variables to characterize these flow conditions. However, the literature is highly fragmented, with different studies adopting distinct sets of metrics such as wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), wall shear stress gradient (WSSG), relative residence time (RRT), or endothelial cell activation potential (ECAP) making it difficult to compare results or establish standardized methodologies. This paper provides the first comprehensive catalog of hemodynamic variables used in cerebral aneurysm studies to date. By systematically identifying and organizing these parameters based on their physical basis and frequency of use, this work offers a consolidated reference to guide future research. The goal is to support consistent variable selection, enhance reproducibility, and facilitate the design of more robust studies linking vascular biomechanics to aneurysm pathophysiology. This review aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to incorporate hemodynamic modeling into cerebral aneurysm analysis and risk assessment.</description>
