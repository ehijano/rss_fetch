      <title>A note on the $L^{p}$-solvability of a strongly-coupled nonlocal system of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the $L^p$-solvability of the strongly-coupled nonlocal system \[
  \mathbb{L} \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{x}) + \lambda \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) \quad \text{in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ } \] where $\mathbb{L}$ is a linear nonlocal coupled vector-valued operator associated with a kernel $K$ comparable to $|\mathbf{y}|^{-(d+2s)}$ for $s \in (0,1)$, satisfying certain ellipticity and cancellation conditions. For any $\mathbf{f} \in [L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)]^d$, $1&lt; p &lt; \infty$, the existence of a unique strong solution $\mathbf{u} \in [H^{2s,p}(\mathbb{R}^d)]^d$ is proved via the method of continuity. To apply this method, we establish the continuity of the operator $\mathbb{L}$ and the necessary \textit{a priori} estimates. These are obtained through the study of the corresponding parabolic system. The proof strategy follows and extends recent ideas developed for the scalar setting, combining commutator estimates, Sobolev embeddings, a level set estimates and a bootstrap argument.</description>

      <title>Higher integrability for minimizers under weighted generalized Orlicz growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate variational integrals in a weighted framework under generalized Orlicz growth conditions. Assuming that the weight belongs to a Muckenhoupt class and the growth function satisfies appropriate structural conditions, we prove that the gradient of any local quasiminimizer has local higher integrability. This result extends the previous higher integrability result to the weighted setting, encompassing as particular cases the weighted variable exponent and weighted double phase frameworks. In addition, we establish the existence of minimizers for the associated functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using anisotropic rearrangement techniques, we first establish the best constants for the singular anisotropic Adams' type inequality with exact growth in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Furthermore, by the same trick, we also prove the singular anisotropic Adams' type inequality on bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>A sharp bound for the ratio of the first two eigenvalues of Robin Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated conjecture by Payne, P\'{o}lya and Weinberger (1956) states that for the fixed membrane problem, the ratio of the first two eigenvalues, $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$, is maximized by a disk. A more general dimensional version of this conjecture was later resolved by Ashbaugh and Benguria in the 1990s. For the Robin Laplacian, Payne and Schaefer (2001) formulated an analogous conjecture, positing that the ratio $\mu_2/\mu_1$ is also maximized by a disk for a range of the boundary parameter $\sigma$. This was later restated by Henrot in 2003. In this work, we affirm this conjecture for all dimensions $N\geq2$ and for all $\sigma$ greater than or equal to a critical positive value $\sigma_*$ which may depend on $\Omega$. Furthermore, we prove that the maximum value of $\mu_2/\mu_1$ is strictly decreasing in $\sigma$ over the entire interval $(0,+\infty)$. Our result provides a positive answer to a variant of Yau's Problem 77: by measuring the ratio of the first two eigenfrequencies, one can determine whether an elastically supported drum is circular.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously recover two constant coefficients and a polygon with a single pair of Cauchy data for the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation over a bounded domain. The aim is to reconstruct two constant coefficients together with the location and shape of a Dirichlet polygonal obstacle from a single pair of Cauchy data. Uniqueness results are verified under some a priori assumptions and the one-wave factorization method has been adapted to recover the polygonal obstacle as well as the two coefficients. A modified factorization using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is employed to overcome difficulties arising from possible eigenvalues. Intensive numerical examples indicate that our method is efficient.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven pattern formation in biomembranes: A gradient flow approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a phase-field model for curvature-driven pattern formation in biomembranes. The model is derived as a gradient flow of an energy functional that approximates the two-phase Canham--Helfrich energy. This leads to a Cahn--Hilliard-type equation with cross diffusion for the relative chemical concentration of one lipid phase, coupled to a fourth-order reaction-diffusion equation describing the height profile of the membrane. We first prove the existence of weak solutions for the case of regular double-well potentials, using a minimizing movement scheme to construct approximate solutions. The analysis is then extended to singular potentials, e.g., the Flory--Huggins potential, by approximating them with a Moreau--Yosida regularization. For both cases, we establish higher regularity, continuous dependence on the initial data, and consequently the uniqueness of weak solutions. Finally, we propose a well-posed finite element discretization of the model and present numerical experiments illustrating the effect of different physical parameters on the resulting membrane patterns. Depending on the parameter regime, we observe purely striped, dotted, or snake-like structures.</description>

      <title>A Liouville-type theorem for Schr\"odinger equations with nonnegative potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $u$ be a solution of $\Delta u=Vu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $V$ be continuous, nonnegative and bounded. We prove that the condition $$\int_{r_j\leq|x|\leq r_j+1}|u(x)|^2dx\to 0,$$ along any sequence $(r_j)$, $r_j\nearrow+\infty$, implies $u\equiv 0$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, this implies the Landis conjecture for solutions satisfying a sufficiently fast algebraic decay. These results are generalized to exterior domains as well as for a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations under suitable conditions on the zero set of the potential.</description>

      <title>Transition threshold for the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition mechanism from laminar flow to turbulent flow is a central problem in hydrodynamic stability theory. To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\it \small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\mathrm{Re}\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\mathrm{Re}$. Precisely, we show that if the initial perturbation satisfies $$\|v_{in}-(y, 0, 0)\|_{\tilde{H}(\mathbb T \times \mathbb D)}\leq \epsilon_0 \,\mathrm{Re}^{-\alpha},$$ with any $\alpha&gt;\frac 23$ and $\tilde{H}=H^6 \cap W^{3,1}$ for $\mathbb D=\mathbb{R}^2$, and with any $\alpha \geq\frac 56$ and $\tilde{H}=H^6$ for $\mathbb D=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$, the corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system exists globally in time and remains asymptotically close to the Couette flow. The main analytical challenge arises from the anisotropic nature of the estimates for the zero modes and from the interactions between zero and non-zero modes, which we address using an anisotropic Sobolev space directly tailored to the zero modes. Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions for Schroedinger-Bopp-Podolsky Systems in Bounded Domains with General Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by adapting the perturbation method, we study normalized standing wave solutions for the following nonlinear Schrodinger-Bopp-Podolsky system:
  - Delta u + q(x) phi u = omega u + f(u) in Omega, - Delta phi + a^2 Delta^2 phi = q(x) u^2 in Omega,
  where Omega is a smooth bounded domain in R^3, a &gt; 0, and omega is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the L^2 mass constraint integral over Omega of u^2 equals mu, and f: R -&gt; R is a continuous function satisfying some technical conditions. In particular, we prove the existence of normalized solutions for all masses mu in an interval (0, mu_0), under either Navier or Neumann boundary conditions for phi. Moreover, when f is odd, we obtain multiplicity of normalized solutions; and if Omega is star-shaped, we further obtain a normalized ground state solution.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of viscosity solutions for a class of degenerate/singular eigenvalue type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a complete classification on the existence and nonexistence results of viscosity solutions to the general Dirichlet problem for a class of eigenvalue type equations. With the distance function included in the right-hand side, this type of equations can be degenerate and (or) singular near the boundary of uniformly convex domains. One highlight is that all cases related to the exponent of the distance function are investigated. Moreover, when viscosity solutions exist, we derive a series of global estimates based on the distance function. The key ingredients of this paper include adaptions of the Perron method and comparison principle as well as constructions of suitable classical sub-solutions and super-solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for Gross-Pitaevskii equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a multiplicity result for solutions of time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equations on closed Riemannian manifolds. Such solutions arise as (possibly non-minimizing) critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau energy having prescribed momentum according to a given tangent velocity field. Lower bounds on the multiplicity of solutions are obtained in terms of the topology of the maximum velocity set, in the small momentum and vorticity core size regime. The proof relies on methods from critical point theory and $\Gamma$-convergence for Ginzburg-Landau functionals as well as on some new results for codimension 2 isoperimetric-type problems in the small flux regime, possibly of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of single blow-up solutions for nonlinear Hartree equation with slightly subcritical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the qualitative properties of single blow-up solutions to the nonlocal equations with slightly subcritical exponents \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u=(|x|^{-(n-2)}\ast u^{p-\epsilon})u^{p-1-\epsilon}\quad \mbox{in}~~\Omega,~~ u=0\quad \mbox{on}~~\partial\Omega,
  \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n=3,4,5$, $\ast$ denotes the standard convolution, $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter and $p=\frac{n+2}{n-2}$ is $\mathcal{D}^{1,2}$ energy-critical exponent. By exploiting various local Pohozaev identities and blow-up analysis, we provide a number of estimates on the first $(n+2)$-eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions, and examine the qualitative behavior of the eigenpairs $(\lambda_{i,\epsilon}, v_{i,\epsilon})$ to the linearied problem of the above nonlocal equations for $i=1,\cdots,n+2$. As a corollary, we derive the Morse index of a single-bubble solution in a nondegenerate setting.</description>

      <title>Stationary equation of the relativistic heat diffusion in transparent media having $L^1$--data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective is to prove existence of a solution to the Dirichlet problem for an equation arising in the theory of radiation hydrodynamics to deal with the radiating energy in transparent media. We study its stationary equation with $L^1$--datum in a bounded domain. This problem was addressed in [11] for regular data (data belonging to $L^N(\Omega)$) and a bounded solution was obtained. In our framework, the proof of existence is far from trivial since the solution sought cannot be bounded. Consequently, the Anzellotti theory of pairings does not apply and we have to use new developments to introduce the meaning of solution. We also study the regularity of solutions when data belong to $L^p(\Omega)$, with $1&lt;p&lt;N$. Our result is coherent with the regularity found in [11].</description>

      <title>Polychromatic Localized Waves with Complex Frequencies in Nonlinear Maxwell Equations with Material Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of polychromatic solutions of cubically nonlinear Maxwell equations in the whole space and with dispersive media, i.e., with a time delayed polarization. Due to the complex nature of the dielectric function, the frequencies are complex, resulting in a decay in time. The geometry is that of a waveguide in $x$ with the propagation direction being $y$ and the solutions are localized in $x$ and TM-polarized. These are often referred to as breathers. They are given as a Fourier series in $y$ and $t$ with the leading frequency $\omega$ being an eigenvalue of a corresponding operator pencil on $\mathbb{R}$ (in the $x$ variable). Each term in the series corresponds to a different temporal decay rate or a different frequency. The series is constructed iteratively via a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Our general result provides the existence under some assumptions on the spectrum and on estimates of the resolvent of the corresponding linear operator. We also produce an example of a waveguide given by the interface of two spatially homogeneous physically relevant media for which these assumptions are satisfied. For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons.</description>

      <title>A Hamilton-Jacobi Framework in a Field-Road System with Unidirectional Advection under Wentzell-Type Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive Hamilton-Jacobi framework to analyze asymptotic propagation dynamics in a field-road system featuring unidirectional advection and Wentzell-type boundary conditions. We rigorously derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality as the singular limit of a reaction-diffusion system in the upper half-plane, where the road is modeled as a degenerate one-dimensional medium with enhanced diffusion and tangential drift. By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution. The solution is characterized by a fundamental solution constructed via optimal paths, revealing a critical transition in propagation behavior governed by a geometrically derived curve that separates rectilinear and road-assisted regimes. Our framework extends to non-order-preserving systems where classical comparison methods fail, and we provide a detailed asymptotic derivation of the Wentzell boundary condition from flux continuity principles. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to conical domains with intersecting roads, demonstrating the robustness of our variational methodology. Numerical simulations illustrate how advection and diffusion parameters shape the invaded region, highlighting the interplay between field and road dynamics in determining propagation patterns.</description>

      <title>Existence results for quasimonotone semilinear coupled elliptic systems via sub-supersolution method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of weak solutions of coupled systems of elliptic partial differential equations with quasimonotone nonlinearities in the domain interior and on the boundary. When the nonlinearities satisfy some monotonicity conditions, we employ monotone iteration techniques to establish the existence of minimal and maximal weak solutions between an ordered pair of sub- and supersolution. In the absence of monotonicity, we prove an existence result when the nonlinearities satisfy certain growth conditions. In addition, we provide concrete examples that illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential in a phase field tumor growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a phase field model for a tumor growth model of Cahn--Hilliard type in which the often assumed parabolic relaxation of the chemical potential is replaced by a hyperbolic one. We show that the resulting initial-boundary value problem is well posed and that its solutions depend continuously on two given functions: one appearing in the mass balance equation and one in the nutrient equation, representing, respectively, sources of drugs (e.g. chemotherapy) and antiangiogenic therapy. We also discuss regularity properties of the solutions. Moreover, in the case of a constant proliferation function, we rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior as the coefficient of the inertial term tends to zero, establishing convergence to the corresponding viscous Cahn--Hilliard tumor growth model. Our results apply to a broad class of double-well potentials, including nonsmooth ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we extend the Lagrangian formulation of \cite{CI08} for Navier-Stokes Equation to a wider class of hydrodynamic models. Moreover, we prove that such Lagrangian formulation is naturally derived from a stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin type variational principle. Generalized version of Kelvin circulation theorem in viscous fluids is discussed. We also derive self-contained local well-posedness results of some fluid equations based on Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation using fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Large data global well-posedness for the modified Novikov-Veselov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modified Novikov-Veselov system (mNV) is a cubic third order dispersive evolution in two space dimensions. It is also completely integrable, belonging to the same hierarchy as the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II (DS II) system.
  The mNV system is $L^2$ critical. Some time ago, Schottdorf proved that for small $L^2$ initial data, the mNV equation is globally well-posed. In this article, we consider instead the large data problem, using inverse scattering methods. Our main result asserts that the mNV system is globally well-posed for large $L^2$ data, with the solutions scattering as time goes to $\pm \infty$. One key ingredient in the proof, which is of independent interest, is a new nonlinear Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for the associated scattering transform.
  As a byproduct of our main result, we are also able to prove a global well-posedness result for the closely related Novikov-Veselov problem at the critical $\dot H^{-1} + L^1$ level, for a range of data which can heuristically be described as soliton-free. Here we use the associated Miura map to connect the mNV and the NV flows. In order to characterize the range of the Miura map, we prove another result of independent interest, namely a sharp, scale invariant form of the Agmon-Allegretto-Piepenbrink principle in the critical case of two space dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of long time inviscid damping for Sobolev perturbations near the Couette flow $(y,0)$ for the 2D Euler equations on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$. For any $s&gt;1$ and any initial vorticity perturbation of size $O(\epsilon)$ in $H^s$, we obtain velocity damping estimates up to a time scale $ t = O(\epsilon^{-\delta_s} )$, where $\delta_s=1/3$ when $s\to 1+$ and $\delta_s=1/2$ for $s&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Computational Finance: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review examines how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have transformed forecasting, decision-making, and financial modelling, promoting innovation and efficiency in financial systems. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we analyze 22 peer-reviewed and open-access articles (2024 to 2026) indexed in Scopus, applying ML and DL models across credit risk prediction, cryptocurrency, asset pricing, and macroeconomic policy modeling. The most used models include Random Forest, XG-Boost, Support Vector Machine, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid or ensemble approaches combining statistical and AI methods. ML and DL techniques outperform traditional models by capturing nonlinear dependencies and enhancing predictive accuracy, while explainable AI methods (e.g., SHAP and feature importance analysis) improve transparency and interpretability. Emerging trends include cross-domain applications and the integration of responsible AI in finance. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in interpretability, generalizability, and data quality. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of AI-driven computational finance and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of generalized abcd Boussinesq solitary waves under a slowly variable bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb R_t\times\mathbb R_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first-order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two-dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among the various particular regimes, each determined by the values of the parameters $(a, b, c, d)$ appearing in the equations, the \emph{generic} regime is characterized by the conditions $b, d &gt; 0$ and $a, c &lt; 0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is Hamiltonian.
  In this paper, we investigate the existence of generalized solitary waves and the corresponding collision problem in the physically relevant \emph{variable bottom regime}, introduced by M.\ Chen. More precisely, the bottom is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=\varepsilon h_0(\varepsilon t,\varepsilon x)$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter and $h_0$ is a fixed smooth profile. This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction. We establish this result by constructing a new approximate solution that captures the interaction between the solitary wave and the slowly varying bottom.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic limit of viscoelastic granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the first rigorous derivation of an incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent and time-dependent forcing terms from the inelastic hard-spheres Boltzmann equation associated to the relevant case of viscoelastic granular gases. The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, M\'emoires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit. The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system obtained by this process appears to be new in this context. As a byproduct of the analysis, we determine the exact dissipation rate of the granular temperature known as \emph{Haff's law}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study flows of $G_2$-structures guided by the principle of dimensional reduction: natural geometric flows in $G_2$-geometry reduce to natural flows in complex geometry. Our main examples are the $G_2$-Laplacian coflow, which lifts the K\"ahler--Ricci flow, and a 7-dimensional lift of the anomaly flow on complex threefolds. The $G_2$-lift of the anomaly flow deforms conformally coclosed $G_2$-structures. We compare the $G_2$-anomaly flow to the $G_2$-Laplacian coflow, and investigate short-time existence and fixed points.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control of Interacting Particle Systems in Hilbert Spaces and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control of interacting particles governed by stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces is an open area of research. Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove the existence of a new class of solutions of 1D cubic NLS with an initial data related to a sum of Dirac masses, of critical regularity $F(L^\infty)$, and belonging to $\dot H^s$ for any $s &lt;-1/2$. This problem is motivated by the lack of result for critical regularity initial condition. Our result is based on a scattering approach, after performing a pseudo-conformal transformation, and on fine estimations of oscillatory integrals.</description>

Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous (or density dependent) incompressible Euler equations in a three-dimensional periodic domain. We construct density $\varrho$ and velocity $u$ such that, for any $\alpha&lt;1/7$, both of them are $\alpha $-H\"older continuous and $(\varrho, u)$ is a weak solution to the underlying equations. The proof is based on typical convex integration techniques using Mikado flows as building blocks. As a main novelty with respect to the related literature, our result produces a H\"older continuous density.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many H\"older continuous, global-in-time, and stationary solutions to the stochastic Euler equations and the hypodissipative Navier-Stokes equations, taking values in the space $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$. For the Euler case, the H\"older exponent $\vartheta$ satisfies $0&lt;\vartheta&lt;\frac{5}{7}\beta$ with $0&lt;\beta&lt; \frac{1}{200}$, while for the hypodissipative Navier-Stokes equations, $\beta$ must additionally satisfy $0&lt;\beta&lt; \min\left\{ \frac{2(1-2\alpha)}{21}, \frac{1}{200}\right\}$. The construction relies on a modified stochastic convex integration scheme, which is central to the analysis. This scheme incorporates Beltrami flows as building blocks and carefully tracks inductive estimates, both pathwise and in expectation. These refinements allow us to achieve improved H\"older regularity for solutions to the underlying stochastic equations, advancing the scope of convex integration techniques in the stochastic setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider hard-potential cutoff multi-species Boltzmann operators modeling microscopic binary elastic collisions and bimolecular reversible chemical reactions inside a gaseous mixture. We prove that the spectral gap estimate derived for the linearized elastic collision operator can be exploited to deduce an explicit negative upper bound for the Dirichlet form of the linearized chemical Boltzmann operator. Such estimate may be used to quantify explicitly the rate of convergence of close-to-equilibrium solutions to the reactive Boltzmann equation toward the global chemical equilibrium of the mixture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define distributions on an abstract measure space endowed with a sequence of partitions, and introduce analogues of Besov spaces with negative smoothness in this setting. In particular, we describe these spaces of distributions using unconditional Schauder bases consisting either of Haar wavelets or of pairs of Dirac masses (dipoles). This framework allows us to obtain duality results between Besov spaces of negative smoothness and H\"older spaces of functions with respect to an appropriately defined pseudo-metric.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <title>Global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for a Willis-type model of elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is shown for a system related to the Willis model of elastodynamics. Both the whole space case and the case of a bounded smooth domain are studied. To this end the equations are reformulated as a linear symmetric hyperbolic system of first order and the existing theory for such systems is applied. If the initial and boundary data is regular enough, classical solutions are obtained. The possibility to transform the problem to a linear symmetric hyperbolic system hinges on a new symmetry condition on the Willis coupling tensor S, not yet considered in the literature. This condition demands that S is a totally symmetric third-order tensor.</description>

      <title>Global Weak Solutions of a Thermodynamically Consistent Diffuse Interface Model for Nonhomogeneous Incompressible Two-phase Flows with a Soluble Surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model that describes the motion of a two-phase flow of two viscous incompressible Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities and a soluble surfactant in a bounded domain of two or three dimensions. The resulting hydrodynamic system consists of a nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system for the (volume averaged) velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system for the phase-field variables $\phi$ and $\psi$ that represent the difference in volume fractions of the binary fluids and the surfactant concentration, respectively. For the initial boundary value problem with physically relevant singular potentials subject to a no-slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase-field variables and the chemical potentials, we first establish the existence of global weak solutions in the case of non-degenerate mobilities based on a suitable semi-implicit time discretization. Next, we prove the existence of global weak solutions for a class of general degenerate mobilities, with the aid of a new type of approximations for both the mobilities and the singular parts of the potential densities.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a generalized Stokes operator on smooth bounded domains via layer-potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions. As an application, we obtain well-posedness results.</description>

      <title>Scattering of the defocusing Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long time behavior of solutions to the defocusing Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS). Using the G\'erard-type explicit formula, we prove the scattering result of solutions to this equation with initial data in $L_{+}^{2,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}): = \{u \in L_{+}^2(\mathbb{R}): |x|^{\alpha} u \in L^2(\mathbb{R})\}$ with some $\alpha&gt;0$. We also characterize the scattering term using the distorted Fourier transform associated with the Lax operator. Following our approach developed in this paper, we can also conclude the asymptotic bound-state/radiation decomposition for global solutions to the focusing (CM-DNLS) with initial data in $L_{+}^{2,\alpha}(\mathbb{R})$ with some $\alpha&gt;0$. This is one of the first works that apply the G\'erard-type explicit formula to study the long-time behavior of an integrable equation for a broad class of initial data, beyond the previously studied rational cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we adapt our recent article [BDD25] to the setting of Dirichlet boundary conditions. A key part is the study of the parabolic equation $a\partial_t w - \Delta w = f$ with a rough coefficient $a$, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the special assumption $\partial_tw \ge 0$. We then apply it to prove existence of global strong solutions to the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) cross-diffusion system with Lotka-Volterra reaction terms in three dimensions and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to obtain estimates for solutions to reaction-diffusion systems modeling reversible chemistry (still when Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered).</description>

      <title>Symmetry and uniqueness of the positive solution for the critical Hartree equation on the Heisenberg group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the moving plane method in integral forms to classify the positive solutions of the critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg group \begin{equation}\label{0.1}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\xi)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\zeta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\xi\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,~~~\zeta,\xi\in\mathbb{H}^{n}, \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}$ denotes the Kohn Laplacian, $u(\xi)$ is a real-valued function, $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $\mu\in (0,Q)$ is a real parameter and $Q^{\ast}_{\mu}=\frac{2Q-\mu}{Q-2}$ is the upper critical exponent associated with the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. By introducing the $\mathbb{H}$-reflection, we prove that the solutions of (\ref{0.1}) are cylindrical, upto Heisenberg translation and suitable scaling of function \begin{equation*}\label{0.2} u_{0}(\zeta)=u_{0}(z,t)=\left((1+|z|^{2})^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{-\frac{Q-2}{4}},~~~\zeta=(z,t)\in \mathbb{H}^{n}. \end{equation*} Furthermore, we show that these positive solutions are also CR inversion-symmetric with respect to the unit CC sphere. Consequently, we establish the uniqueness of positive solutions to equation (\ref{0.1}).</description>

      <title>Failure of Lang's Flat Chain Conjecture and non-regularity of the prescribed Jacobian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Lang's Flat Chain Conjecture (that is, without requiring finite mass of the underlying currents) fails for metric $k$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whenever $d\geq 2$ and $k\in\{1, \dots, d\}$. In all other cases, it holds. The original conjecture due to Ambrosio and Kirchheim remains open. We first connect Lang's conjecture to a regularity statement concerning the prescribed Jacobian equation near $L^\infty$. We then show that the equation does not have the required regularity. For a Lipschitz vector field $\pi$, its derivative $\mathrm{D}\pi$ exists a.e. and is identified with a matrix. Our non-regularity results for the prescribed Jacobian equation quantify how "small" the set
  \begin{equation*}
  \operatorname{conv}(\{\operatorname{det}\mathrm{D} \pi: \operatorname{Lip}(\pi)\leq L\})\subset L^\infty
  \end{equation*}
  is for every $L&gt;0$. The symbol "$\operatorname{conv}$" stands for the convex hull. The "smallness" is quantified in topological terms and is used to show that Lang's Flat Chain Conjecture fails.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>The Willmore energy and curvature concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions of a Riemannian surface $(\Omega,\frak{g})$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, into $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>
