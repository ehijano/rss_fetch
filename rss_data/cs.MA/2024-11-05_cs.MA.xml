      <title>Measuring Responsibility in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of quantitative measures of responsibility in multi-agent planning, building upon the concepts of causal responsibility proposed by Parker et al.~[ParkerGL23]. These concepts are formalised within a variant of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic. Unlike existing approaches, our framework ascribes responsibility to agents for a given outcome by linking probabilities between behaviours and responsibility through three metrics, including an entropy-based measurement of responsibility. This latter measure is the first to capture the causal responsibility properties of outcomes over time, offering an asymptotic measurement that reflects the difficulty of achieving these outcomes. Our approach provides a fresh understanding of responsibility in multi-agent systems, illuminating both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of agents' roles in achieving or preventing outcomes.</description>

      <title>Role Play: Learning Adaptive Role-Specific Strategies in Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which requires agents to adapt to unseen agents, has attracted increasing attention. Traditional approaches often rely on the Self-Play (SP) framework to generate a diverse set of policies in a policy pool, which serves to improve the generalization capability of the final agent. However, these frameworks may struggle to capture the full spectrum of potential strategies, especially in real-world scenarios that demand agents balance cooperation with competition. In such settings, agents need strategies that can adapt to varying and often conflicting goals. Drawing inspiration from Social Value Orientation (SVO)-where individuals maintain stable value orientations during interactions with others-we propose a novel framework called \emph{Role Play} (RP). RP employs role embeddings to transform the challenge of policy diversity into a more manageable diversity of roles. It trains a common policy with role embedding observations and employs a role predictor to estimate the joint role embeddings of other agents, helping the learning agent adapt to its assigned role. We theoretically prove that an approximate optimal policy can be achieved by optimizing the expected cumulative reward relative to an approximate role-based policy. Experimental results in both cooperative (Overcooked) and mixed-motive games (Harvest, CleanUp) reveal that RP consistently outperforms strong baselines when interacting with unseen agents, highlighting its robustness and adaptability in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Integration of Large Vision Language Models for Efficient Post-disaster Damage Assessment and Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a new avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, the first multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core model, DisasTeller autonomously implements disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and optimising resource distribution. Our evaluations through both LVLMs and humans demonstrate DisasTeller's effectiveness in streamlining disaster response. This framework not only supports expert teams but also simplifies access to disaster management processes for non-experts, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and LVLM-driven efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning to Construct Implicit Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication is an essential component in collaborative multi-agent systems. Situations where explicit messaging is not feasible have been common in human society throughout history, which motivate the study of implicit communication. Previous works on learning implicit communication mostly rely on theory of mind (ToM), where agents infer the mental states and intentions of others by interpreting their actions. However, ToM-based methods become less effective in making accurate inferences in complex tasks. In this work, we propose the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP) framework, which allows agents to construct implicit communication channels similar to the explicit ones. ICP leverages a subset of actions, denoted as the scouting actions, and a mapping between information and these scouting actions that encodes and decodes the messages. We propose training algorithms for agents to message and act, including learning with a randomly initialized information map and with a delayed information map. The efficacy of ICP has been tested on the tasks of Guessing Number, Revealing Goals, and Hanabi, where ICP significantly outperforms baseline methods through more efficient information transmission.</description>

      <title>Preference-CFR$\:$ Beyond Nash Equilibrium for Better Game Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have leveraged large-scale games as benchmarks to gauge progress, with AI now frequently outperforming human capabilities. Traditionally, this success has largely relied on solving Nash equilibrium (NE) using variations of the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) method in games with incomplete information. However, the variety of Nash equilibria has been largely overlooked in previous research, limiting the adaptability of AI to meet diverse human preferences. To address this challenge, where AI is powerful but struggles to meet customization needs, we introduce a novel approach: Preference-CFR, which incorporates two new parameters: preference degree and vulnerability degree. These parameters allow for greater flexibility in AI strategy development without compromising convergence. Our method significantly alters the distribution of final strategies, enabling the creation of customized AI models that better align with individual user needs. Using Texas Hold'em as a case study, our experiments demonstrate how Preference CFR can be adjusted to either emphasize customization, prioritizing user preferences, or to enhance performance, striking a balance between the depth of customization and strategic optimality.</description>

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making by interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from prior decisions and external inputs, they exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under two settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs and (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like Mistral and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on substantial empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.</description>

      <title>HiMemFormer: Hierarchical Memory-Aware Transformer for Multi-Agent Action Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting human actions has been a long-standing challenge and is a crucial measure of perception in robotics AI. While significant progress has been made in anticipating the future actions of individual agents, prior work has largely overlooked a key aspect of real-world human activity -- interactions. To address this gap in human-like forecasting within multi-agent environments, we present the Hierarchical Memory-Aware Transformer (HiMemFormer), a transformer-based model for online multi-agent action anticipation. HiMemFormer integrates and distributes global memory that captures joint historical information across all agents through a transformer framework, with a hierarchical local memory decoder that interprets agent-specific features based on these global representations using a coarse-to-fine strategy. In contrast to previous approaches, HiMemFormer uniquely hierarchically applies the global context with agent-specific preferences to avoid noisy or redundant information in multi-agent action anticipation. Extensive experiments on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the significant performance of HiMemFormer, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>GITSR: Graph Interaction Transformer-based Scene Representation for Multi Vehicle Collaborative Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose GITSR, an effective framework for Graph Interaction Transformer-based Scene Representation for multi-vehicle collaborative decision-making in intelligent transportation system. In the context of mixed traffic where Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human Driving Vehicles (HDVs) coexist, in order to enhance the understanding of the environment by CAVs to improve decision-making capabilities, this framework focuses on efficient scene representation and the modeling of spatial interaction behaviors of traffic states. We first extract features of the driving environment based on the background of intelligent networking. Subsequently, the local scene representation, which is based on the agent-centric and dynamic occupation grid, is calculated by the Transformer module. Besides, feasible region of the map is captured through the multi-head attention mechanism to reduce the collision of vehicles. Notably, spatial interaction behaviors, based on motion information, are modeled as graph structures and extracted via Graph Neural Network (GNN). Ultimately, the collaborative decision-making among multiple vehicles is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with driving actions output by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Our algorithmic validation is executed within the extremely challenging scenario of highway off-ramp task, thereby substantiating the superiority of agent-centric approach to scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the GITSR method can not only effectively capture scene representation but also extract spatial interaction data, outperforming the baseline method across various comparative metrics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Game-Theoretic Control in Socio-Technical Networks: Emerging Design Frameworks and Contemporary Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Coverage Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributed control law for a heterogeneous multi-robot coverage problem, where the robots could have different energy characteristics, such as capacity and depletion rates, due to their varying sizes, speeds, capabilities, and payloads. Existing energy-aware coverage control laws consider capacity differences but assume the battery depletion rate to be the same for all robots. In realistic scenarios, however, some robots can consume energy much faster than other robots; for instance, UAVs hover at different altitudes, and these changes could be dynamically updated based on their assigned tasks. Robots' energy capacities and depletion rates need to be considered to maximize the performance of a multi-robot system. To this end, we propose a new energy-aware controller based on Lloyd's algorithm to adapt the weights of the robots based on their energy dynamics and divide the area of interest among the robots accordingly. The controller is theoretically analyzed and extensively evaluated through simulations and real-world demonstrations in multiple realistic scenarios and compared with three baseline control laws to validate its performance and efficacy.</description>

      <title>Choreographing the Rhythms of Observation: Dynamics for Ranged Observer Bipartite-Unipartite SpatioTemporal (ROBUST) Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing network analysis methods struggle to optimize observer placements in dynamic environments with limited visibility. This dissertation introduces the novel ROBUST (Ranged Observer Bipartite-Unipartite SpatioTemporal) framework, offering a significant advancement in modeling, analyzing, and optimizing observer networks within complex spatiotemporal domains. ROBUST leverages a unique bipartite-unipartite approach, distinguishing between observer and observable entities while incorporating spatial constraints and temporal dynamics.
  This research extends spatiotemporal network theory by introducing novel graph-based measures, including myopic degree, spatial closeness centrality, and edge length proportion. These measures, coupled with advanced clustering techniques like Proximal Recurrence, provide insights into network structure, resilience, and the effectiveness of observer placements. The ROBUST framework demonstrates superior resource allocation and strategic responsiveness compared to conventional models. Case studies in oceanographic monitoring, urban safety networks, and multi-agent path planning showcases its practical applicability and adaptability. Results demonstrate significant improvements in coverage, response times, and overall network efficiency.
  This work paves the way for future research in incorporating imperfect knowledge, refining temporal pathing methodologies, and expanding the scope of applications. By bridging theoretical advancements with practical solutions, ROBUST stands as a significant contribution to the field, promising to inform and inspire ongoing and future endeavors in network optimization and multi-agent system planning.</description>

      <title>Assigning Credit with Partial Reward Decoupling in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</description>

      <title>Sequential Resource Trading Using Comparison-Based Gradient Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents interact with other agents of unknown preferences to share resources in their environment. We explore sequential trading for resource allocation in a setting where two greedily rational agents sequentially trade resources from a finite set of categories. Each agent has a utility function that depends on the amount of resources it possesses in each category. The offering agent makes trade offers to improve its utility without knowing the responding agent's utility function, and the responding agent only accepts offers that improve its utility. We present an algorithm for the offering agent to estimate the responding agent's gradient (preferences) and make offers based on previous acceptance or rejection responses. The algorithm's goal is to reach a Pareto-optimal resource allocation state while ensuring that the utilities of both agents improve after every accepted trade. We show that, after a finite number of consecutively rejected offers, the responding agent is at a near-optimal state, or the agents' gradients are closely aligned. We compare the proposed algorithm against various baselines in continuous and discrete trading scenarios and show that it improves the societal benefit with fewer offers.</description>

      <title>Bearing-Distance Based Flocking with Zone-Based Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel zone-based flocking control approach suitable for dynamic multi-agent systems (MAS). Inspired by Reynolds behavioral rules for $boids$, flocking behavioral rules with the zones of repulsion, conflict, attraction, and surveillance are introduced. For each agent, using only bearing and distance measurements, behavioral deviation vectors quantify the deviations from the local separation, local and global flock velocity alignment, local cohesion, obstacle avoidance and boundary conditions, and strategic separation for avoiding alien agents. The control strategy uses the local perception-based behavioral deviation vectors to guide each agent's motion. Additionally, the control strategy incorporates a directionally-aware obstacle avoidance mechanism that prioritizes obstacles in the agent's forward path. We also introduce a simplified flocking model where agents interact with their neighbors within a single perception zone, without dividing it into separate interaction zones. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the models in creating flexible, adaptable, and scalable flocking behavior.</description>

      <title>Soft Condorcet Optimization for Ranking of General Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common way to drive progress of AI models and agents is to compare their performance on standardized benchmarks. Comparing the performance of general agents requires aggregating their individual performances across a potentially wide variety of different tasks. In this paper, we describe a novel ranking scheme inspired by social choice frameworks, called Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), to compute the optimal ranking of agents: the one that makes the fewest mistakes in predicting the agent comparisons in the evaluation data. This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate when evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples from a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system criteria. SCO ratings are maximal for Condorcet winners when they exist, which we show is not necessarily true for the classical rating system Elo. We propose three optimization algorithms to compute SCO ratings and evaluate their empirical performance. When serving as an approximation to the Kemeny-Young voting method, SCO rankings are on average 0 to 0.043 away from the optimal ranking in normalized Kendall-tau distance across 865 preference profiles from the PrefLib open ranking archive. In a simulated noisy tournament setting, SCO achieves accurate approximations to the ground truth ranking and the best among several baselines when 59\% or more of the preference data is missing. Finally, SCO ranking provides the best approximation to the optimal ranking, measured on held-out test sets, in a problem containing 52,958 human players across 31,049 games of the classic seven-player game of Diplomacy.</description>

      <title>Proportionality and Strategyproofness in Multiwinner Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiwinner voting rules can be used to select a fixed-size committee from a larger set of candidates. We consider approval-based committee rules, which allow voters to approve or disapprove candidates. In this setting, several voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable version of the computer-generated proof is obtained by extracting a minimal unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in the domain of committee elections.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control and Coordinate Mixed Traffic Through Robot Vehicles at Complex and Unsignalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern metropolises. However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic by leveraging the ability of autonomous vehicles. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic by RVs at real-world, complex intersections -- an open challenge to date. We design comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, generalizablility, and adaptability of our approach. In particular, our method can prevent congestion formation via merely 5% RVs under a real-world traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion will form when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Moreover, when the RV penetration rate exceeds 60%, our method starts to outperform traffic signal control in terms of the average waiting time of all vehicles. Our method is not only robust against blackout events, sudden RV percentage drops, and V2V communication error, but also enjoys excellent generalizablility, evidenced by its successful deployment in five unseen intersections. Lastly, our method performs well under various traffic rules, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse scenarios.

      <title>JaxMARL: Multi-Agent RL Environments and Algorithms in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial in the development of machine learning algorithms, with available environments significantly influencing reinforcement learning (RL) research. Traditionally, RL environments run on the CPU, which limits their scalability with typical academic compute. However, recent advancements in JAX have enabled the wider use of hardware acceleration, enabling massively parallel RL training pipelines and environments. While this has been successfully applied to single-agent RL, it has not yet been widely adopted for multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we present JaxMARL, the first open-source, Python-based library that combines GPU-enabled efficiency with support for a large number of commonly used MARL environments and popular baseline algorithms. Our experiments show that, in terms of wall clock time, our JAX-based training pipeline is around 14 times faster than existing approaches, and up to 12500x when multiple training runs are vectorized. This enables efficient and thorough evaluations, potentially alleviating the evaluation crisis in the field. We also introduce and benchmark SMAX, a JAX-based approximate reimplementation of the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine. This not only enables GPU acceleration, but also provides a more flexible MARL environment, unlocking the potential for self-play, meta-learning, and other future applications in MARL. The code is available at https://github.com/flairox/jaxmarl.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of multi-agent systems, ensuring robustness in unfamiliar and adversarial settings is crucial. Notwithstanding their outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which "masters" the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Simplification of Robotic System Model Analysis by Petri Net Meta-Model Property Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a simplification of robotic system model analysis due to the transfer of Robotic System Hierarchical Petri Net (RSHPN) meta-model properties onto the model of a designed system. Key contributions include: 1) analysis of RSHPN meta-model properties; 2) decomposition of RSHPN analysis into analysis of individual Petri nets, thus the reduction of state space explosion; and 3) transfer of RSHPN meta-model properties onto the produced models, hence elimination of the need for full re-analysis of the RSHPN model when creating new robotic systems. Only task-dependent parts of the model need to be analyzed. This approach streamlines the analysis thus reducing the design time. Moreover, it produces a specification which is a solid foundation for the implementation of the system. The obtained results highlight the potential of Petri nets as a valuable formal framework for analyzing robotic system properties.</description>

      <title>Performative Prediction on Games and Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents often have individual goals which depend on a group's actions. If agents trust a forecast of collective action and adapt strategically, such prediction can influence outcomes non-trivially, resulting in a form of performative prediction. This effect is ubiquitous in scenarios ranging from pandemic predictions to election polls, but existing work has ignored interdependencies among predicted agents. As a first step in this direction, we study a collective risk dilemma where agents dynamically decide whether to trust predictions based on past accuracy. As predictions shape collective outcomes, social welfare arises naturally as a metric of concern. We explore the resulting interplay between accuracy and welfare, and demonstrate that searching for stable accurate predictions can minimize social welfare with high probability in our setting. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism design.</description>
