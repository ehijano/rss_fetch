      <title>Efficient Kernelized Learning in Polyhedral Games Beyond Full-Information: From Colonel Blotto to Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the problem of efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in polyhedral games, that is, normal-form games with an exponentially large number of actions per player and an underlying combinatorial structure. Prominent examples of such games are the classical Colonel Blotto and congestion games. To achieve computational efficiency, the learning algorithms must exhibit regret and per-iteration complexity that scale polylogarithmically in the size of the players' action sets. This challenge has recently been addressed in the full-information setting, primarily through the use of kernelization. However, in the case of the realistic, but mathematically challenging, partial-information setting, existing approaches result in suboptimal and impractical runtime complexity to learn CCE. We tackle this limitation by building a framework based on the kernelization paradigm. We apply this framework to prominent examples of polyhedral games -- namely the Colonel Blotto, graphic matroid and network congestion games -- and provide computationally efficient payoff-based learning algorithms, which significantly improve upon prior works in terms of the runtime for learning CCE in these settings.</description>

      <title>A Category Theoretic Approach to Approximate Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of game theory.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Complexity for Computing Nash Equilibria in Adversarial Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial team games model multiplayer strategic interactions in which a team of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial player in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in game theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments wherein the cooperation of one team -- in the absence of explicit communication -- is obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly understood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von Stengel and Koller (GEB `97), different solution concepts have received attention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard Nash equilibrium has remained open.
  In this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local search (CLS), thereby establishing CLS-completeness by virtue of the recent CLS-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC `21) in potential games. To do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any $\epsilon$-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in polynomial time to an $O(\epsilon)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the $O(\cdot)$ notation suppresses polynomial factors in the description of the game. As a consequence, we show that the Moreau envelop of a suitable best response function acts as a potential under certain natural gradient-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid Optimally and Efficiently in Adversarial First-price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Connectedness in weighted consensus division of graphical cakes between two agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Austin's moving knife procedure was originally introduced to find a consensus division of an interval/circular cake between two agents, each of whom believes that they receive exactly half of the cake. We generalise this in two ways: we consider cakes modelled by graphs, and let the two agents have unequal, arbitrary entitlements. In this setting, we seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes they received exactly the share they are entitled to -- which also minimises the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we review the weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For a tree, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the minimal height of the tree. For a connected graphical cake, each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph. Finally, for a graphical cake with s connected components, the division involves at most s+2r+4 connected pieces, where r is the maximum radius among all connected components.</description>
