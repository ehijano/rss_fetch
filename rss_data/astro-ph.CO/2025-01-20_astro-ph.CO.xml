      <title>Evolution of SMBHs in light of PTA measurements: implications for growth by mergers and accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the growth of supermassive black holes accounting for both accretion and mergers. The former is informed by observations of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and the latter by the gravitational wave-background (GWB) recently detected by PTAs, while estimates of the present-day black hole mass function provide a boundary condition. The GWB is dominated by the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\odot}$). We show that their evolution can be simplified into a two-step process: mergers dominate at $z\leq1$, while accretion peaks at $1.4\leq z\leq2$. The large amplitude of the observed GWB suggests a significant number of mergers. We show that this generically implies a higher average Eddington ratio for quasars relative to a scenario in which mergers are negligible. In the absence of mergers, matching local estimates of BH abundance to the QLF implies a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_r=0.12$ and Eddington ratio $\lambda=0.2$. With mergers, a progenitor of mass $M_i$ is boosted to a final total mass $M_f$ and there is a direct relation between the mass gained in mergers and the average Eddington ratio of the quasar population, given by $M_f/M_i\sim\lambda/0.2$. There is thus a tension between the observed GWB, quasar properties, and the BH mass function: estimates of the mass function consistent with Eddington ratios inferred in quasars and $\epsilon_r\sim0.1$ underpredict the GWB; multiple/equal mass mergers can boost the GWB, but lead to a high Eddington ratio. If the local mass function is on the high end of current estimates, the GWB is more readily explained, but requires low efficiencies $\epsilon_r\sim10^{-2}$ not expected in standard luminous accretion models. The significant merger rate implied by the GWB also strongly suggests that the most massive BHs in the local universe have significant spin due to the orbital angular momentum from mergers, perhaps $a\sim0.5$.</description>

      <title>Kinematically induced dipole anisotropy in line-emitting galaxy number counts and line intensity maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of the solar system against an isotropic radiation background, such as the cosmic microwave background, induces a dipole anisotropy in the background due to the Doppler effect. Flux-limited observation of the continuum radiation from galaxies also has been studied extensively to show a dipole anisotropy due to the Doppler effect and the aberration effect. We show that a similar dipole anisotropy exists in spectral-line intensity maps, represented as either galaxy number counts or the diffuse intensity maps. The amplitude of these dipole anisotropies is determined by not only the solar velocity against the large-scale structures but also the temporal evolution of the monopole (sky-average) component. Measuring the dipole at multiple frequencies, which have mutually independent origins due to their occurrence from multiple redshifts, can provide a very accurate measure of the solar velocity thanks to the redundant information. We find that such a measurement can even constrain astrophysical parameters in the nearby universe. We explore the potential for dipole measurement of existing and upcoming surveys, and conclude that the spectral number count of galaxies through SPHEREx will be optimal for the first measurement of the dipole anisotropy in the spectral-line galaxy distribution. LIM surveys with reasonable accuracy are also found to be promising. We also discuss whether these experiments might reveal a peculiar nature of our local universe, that seems to call for a non-standard cosmology other than the simple LambdaCDM model as suggested by recent measures of the baryon acoustic oscillation signatures and the Alcock-Paczynski tests.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy Merger: The Champagne Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for 103 member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We used cosmological simulations to find analogous systems to constrain the time since pericenter (74-250 Myr) and the angle the merger axis makes with the plane of the sky (62$^\circ$-90$^\circ$) at the 68$\%$ confidence level. We estimated the bulk temperature (8.20 $\pm 1.2$ keV) and total X-ray luminosity (5.2 $\pm$ 0.8 $\times$ $10^{44}$ erg $\times$ $s^{-1}$) of the intracluster medium using $\textit{Chandra}$ archival data.</description>

      <title>DeepSSM: an emulator of gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeepSSM, an open-source code powered by neural networks (NNs) to emulate gravitational wave (GW) spectra produced by sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions in the radiation-dominated era. The training data is obtained from an enhanced version of the Sound Shell Model (SSM), which accounts for the effects of cosmic expansion and yields more accurate spectra in the infrared regime. The emulator enables instantaneous predictions of GW spectra given the phase transition parameters, while achieving agreement with the enhanced SSM model within 10\% accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. The emulator is highly computationally efficient and fully differentiable, making it particularly suitable for direct Bayesian inference on phase transition parameters without relying on empirical templates, such as broken power-law models. We demonstrate this capability by successfully reconstructing phase transition parameters and their degeneracies from mock LISA observations using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The code is available at: https://github.com/ctian282/DeepSSM.</description>

      <title>Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for Resolving Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations, but is increasingly challenged by the emergence of cosmological tensions, particularly the Hubble Tension $H_0$ and the $S_8$ tension. The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\sigma$, and the $S_8$ tension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\sigma$, highlight inconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or vice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark species are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3 samples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis shows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data. However, we show that the IDE model features positive Bayesian evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM only when Cepheid distance calibration in the SH0ES sample is used to calibrate SNIa data from PantheonPlus.</description>

      <title>Optical gravitational waves as signals of Gravitationally-Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived heavy particles present during the big bang could have a decay channel opened by gravitons. Such decays can produce gravitational waves with large enough abundance to be detectable, and a peculiar narrow spectrum peaked today around optical frequencies. We identify which particles can decay in one or two gravitons. The maximal gravitational wave abundance arises from theories with extra hidden strong gauge dynamics, such as a confining pure-glue group. An interesting abundance also arises in theories with perturbative couplings. Future observation might shed light on early cosmology and allow some spectroscopy of sub-Planckian gravitationally-decaying particles, plausibly present in a variety of theories such as gauge unification, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, strings.</description>

      <title>The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$\% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $&gt; 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. Using this information, we expect next-generation radio telescopes to detect a few dozen bursts per year at $z \gtrsim 6$. A radio telescope with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 1$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 14 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 200$ square degrees should be able to detect $1.4^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\times 10^3$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $234^{+250}_{-162}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.</description>

      <title>Infrared Behavior of Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Induced gravitational waves provide a powerful probe of primordial perturbations in the early universe through their distinctive spectral properties. We analyze the spectral energy density $\Omega_{\text{GW}}$ of gravitational waves induced by isocurvature scalar perturbations. In the infrared regime, we find that the spectral slope $n_{\text{GW}} \equiv \text{d} \ln\Omega_\mathrm{GW}/\text{d}\ln k$ takes the log-dependent form $3-4/ \ln (\tilde{k}_*^2 / 6k^2)$, where $\tilde{k}_*$ represents the effective peak scale of the primordial scalar power spectrum. This characteristic behavior differs markedly from that of adiabatic-induced gravitational waves, establishing a robust observational discriminant between isocurvature and adiabatic primordial perturbation modes.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in the presence of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out a new effect on the freeze-out process of heavy particles induced by density perturbations in the early universe, which we call ``acoustically driven freeze-out.'' This beyond-linear effect is caused by the exponential decoupling of heavy particles from the thermal bath in the presence of density perturbations, and already at moderately large values $\delta T / \bar{T} = O (10^{-2})$ it cannot be captured by linear perturbation theory. We illustrate this effect with leptogenesis taking the decay and inverse decay of heavy neutrinos into account, and discuss its phenomenological implications. We found that perturbations always enhance the (spatially averaged) values of the final lepton asymmetry, and as a result, constraints on the mass of heavy neutrinos are found to be relaxed in the presence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition, and, remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We anticipate that the data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. Numerous gravitational wave signals overlap in the time and/or frequency domain, and the possible correlation between them has to be taken into account during their detection and characterization. In this work, we present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge; it is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a.</description>

      <title>Late-forming black holes and the antiproton, gamma-ray, and anti-helium excesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes long-lived enough to be the dark matter have temperatures below the MeV. Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here we investigate if such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We find that late-forming black holes cannot simultaneously explain all these excesses. We additionally compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).</description>

      <title>Testing the parametric model for self-interacting dark matter using matched halos in cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: We systemically evaluate the performance of the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halo model proposed in arXiv:2305.16176 with matched halos from high-resolution cosmological CDM and SIDM simulations. The model incorporates SIDM effects along mass evolution histories of CDM halos and it is applicable to both isolated halos and suhbhalos. We focus on the accuracy of the model in predicting halo density profiles at $z=0$ and the evolution of maximum circular velocity. We find the model predictions agree with the simulations within $10\%-50\%$ for most of the simulated (sub)halos, $50\%-100\%$ for extreme cases. This indicates that the model effectively captures the gravothermal evolution of the halos with very strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. For an example application, we apply the model to study the impact of various SIDM scenarios on strong lensing perturber systems, demonstrating its utility in predicting SIDM effects for small-scale structure analyses. Our findings confirm that the model is an effective tool for mapping CDM halos into their SIDM counterparts.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: An assessment of the systematic errors in the predictions of models for galaxy cluster counts used to infer cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster counts have historically been important for the measurement of cosmological parameters and upcoming surveys will greatly reduce the statistical errors. To exploit the potential of current and future cluster surveys, theoretical uncertainties on the predicted abundance must be smaller than the statistical errors. Models used to predict cluster counts typically combine a model for the dark matter only (DMO) halo mass function (HMF) with an observable - mass relation that is assumed to be a power-law with lognormal scatter. We use the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to quantify the biases in the cluster counts and cosmological parameters resulting from the different ingredients of conventional models. For the observable mass proxy we focus on the Compton-Y parameter quantifying the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is expected to result in cluster samples that are relatively close to mass-selected samples. We construct three mock samples based on existing (Planck and SPT) and upcoming (Simons Observatory) surveys. We ignore measurement uncertainties and compare the biases in the counts and inferred cosmological parameters to each survey's Poisson errors. We find that widely used models for the DMO HMF differ significantly from each other and from the DMO version of FLAMINGO, leading to significant biases for all three surveys. For upcoming surveys, dramatic improvements are needed for all additional model ingredients, i.e. the functional forms of the fits to the observable-mass scaling relation and the associated scatter, the priors on the scaling relation and the prior on baryonic effects associated with feedback processes on the HMF.</description>

      <title>BullFrog: Multi-step perturbation theory as a time integrator for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the cosmic large-scale structure can be done through numerical N-body simulations or by using perturbation theory. Here, we present an N-body approach that effectively implements a multi-step forward model based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe. This is achieved by introducing the second-order accurate BullFrog integrator, which automatically performs 2LPT time steps to second order without requiring the explicit computation of 2LPT displacements. Importantly, we show that BullFrog trajectories rapidly converge to the exact solution as the number of time steps increases, at any moment in time, even though 2LPT becomes invalid after shell-crossing. As a validation test, we compare BullFrog against other N-body integrators and high-order LPT, both for a realistic $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and for simulations with a sharp UV cutoff in the initial conditions. The latter scenario enables controlled experiments against LPT and, in practice, is particularly relevant for modelling coarse-grained fluids arising in the context of effective field theory. We demonstrate that BullFrog significantly improves upon other LPT-inspired integrators, such as FastPM and COLA, without incurring any computational overhead compared to standard N-body integrators. Implementing BullFrog in any existing N-body code is straightforward, particularly if FastPM is already integrated.</description>

      <title>Prospects of a statistical detection of the 21-cm forest and its potential to constrain the thermal state of the neutral IGM during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest signal is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization complementary to other 21-cm line observables and Ly$\alpha$ forest signal. Prospects of detecting it have significantly improved in the last decade thanks to the discovery of more than 30 radio-loud quasars at these redshifts, upgrades to telescope facilities, and the notion that neutral hydrogen islands persist down to $z\lesssim 5.5$. We forward-model the 21-cm forest signal using semi-numerical simulations and incorporate various instrumental features to explore the potential of detecting the 21-cm forest at $z=6$, both directly and statistically, with the currently available (uGMRT) and forthcoming (SKA1-low) observatories. We show that it is possible to detect the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest spectrum, especially at large scales of $k\lesssim8.5\,\rm MHz^{-1}$ with the $500\,\rm hr$ of the uGMRT time and $k\lesssim32.4\,\rm MHz^{-1}$ with the SKA1-low over $50\,\rm hr$ if the intergalactic medium (IGM) is $25\%$ neutral and these neutral hydrogen regions have a spin temperature of $\lesssim30\,\rm K$. On the other hand, we infer that a null-detection of the signal with such observations of 10 radio-loud sources at $z\approx6$ can be translated into constraints on the thermal and ionization state of the IGM which are tighter than the currently available measurements. Moreover, a null-detection of the 1D 21-cm forest power spectrum with only $50\,\rm hr$ of the uGMRT observations of 10 radio-loud sources can already be competitive with the Ly$\alpha$ forest and 21-cm tomographic observations in disfavouring models of significantly neutral and cold IGM at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Forecasts of effects of beam systematics and deprojection on the third-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are susceptible to various instrumental errors, especially for $B$-mode measurements. The difference between the response of two polarized detectors, referred to as the beam mismatch, would induce a $T\rightarrow P$ leakage when the detector pair is differenced to cancel the unpolarized signal. We applied the deprojection technique on the time-ordered mock data to mitigate the systematic contamination caused by beam mismatches by assuming the third-generation ground-based CMB experiment (S3). Our results show that the deprojection effectively recovered the input power spectra. We adopted the Needlet ILC (NILC) and constrained ILC (cILC) methods to reconstruct the foreground-cleaned $TEB$ maps, and we evaluated the level of residual systematic errors after the foreground cleaning pipeline by comparing the power spectra between the systematics-added data after deprojection and the systematics-free data. The results show that the residual beam systematics cleaned by deprojection do not bias the CMB measurements of the $T$, $E$, and $B$ modes nor the CMB lensing reconstruction or the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio under the S3 sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Broad primordial power spectrum and $\mu$-distortion constraints on primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) might originate from supermassive primordial black holes (PBHs). However, the hypothesis that these PBHs formed through the enhancement of the primordial curvature perturbations has consistently faced significant challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by $\mu$-distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on $\mu$-distortion constraint in the context of broad power spectra. Our results show that, under the assumption of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations, a broad power spectrum may lead to weaker $\mu$-distortion constraints compared to the Gaussian cases. Our findings highlight the potential of the broad power spectrum to alleviate the $\mu$-distortion constraints on supermassive PBHs under large non-Gaussianity.</description>

Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasars discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources (SHORES) multiple pencil beam survey that observed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 29 fields in total intensity and polarization within the Herschel-ATLAS Southern Galactic Field. This paper presents the observations, calibration and analysis of the 27 shallow fields that cover an overall area of $\sim 26$ square degree with increasing sensitivity towards the phase centers of each pointing according to the ATCA 22 m dish response function, down to $\sigma\lesssim 33\, \mu$Jy. Two additional (deep) fields have been observed to even higher sensitivity. All the SHORES observations have been calibrated to account also for linear polarization. Polarization and deeper field analysis will be presented in future papers. The SHORES shallow-field sample considered in the present paper counts $2294$ sources detected with BLOBCAT to signal-to-noise ratio $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$. Simulations determined that our procedure and final catalog is 95% reliable above $497.5\, \mu$Jy and $95\%$ complete to the $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$ significance level. By exploiting ATCA E-W 6 km configuration we reached resolutions of $3.2\times 7.2$ arcsec, to which level $81\%$ of our sources are unresolved. We determined source counts down to the $150\, \mu$Jy level. For the sources with a counterpart in H-ATLAS, the FIR-radio correlation is calculated and discussed.</description>
