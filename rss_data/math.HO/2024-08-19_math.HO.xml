      <title>Permanence as a Principle of Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses Peano's argument for preserving familiar notations. The argument reinforces the principle of permanence, articulated in the early 19th century by Peacock, then adjusted by Hankel and adopted by many others. Typically regarded as a principle of theoretical rationality, permanence was understood by Peano, following Mach, and against Schubert, as a principle of practical rationality. The paper considers how permanence, thus understood, was used in justifying Burali-Forti and Marcolongo's notation for vectorial calculus, and in rejecting Frege's logical notation, and closes by considering Hahn's revival of Peano's argument against Pringsheim' reading of permanence as a logically necessary principle.</description>

      <title>Why Did Weyl Think that Emmy Noether Made Algebra the Eldorado of Axiomatics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper attempts to clarify Weyl's metaphorical description of Emmy Noether's algebra as the Eldorado of axiomatics. It discusses Weyl's early view on axiomatics, which is part of his criticism of Dedekind and Hilbert, as motivated by Weyl's acquiescence to a phenomenological epistemology of correctness, then it describes Noether's work in algebra, emphasizing in particular its ancestral relation to Dedekind's and Hilbert's works, as well as her mathematical methods, characterized by non-elementary reasoning, i.e., reasoning detached from mathematical objects. The paper turns then to Weyl's remarks on Noether's work, and argues against assimilating her use of the axiomatic method in algebra to his late view on axiomatics, on the ground of the latter's resistance to Noether's principle of detachment.</description>

      <title>Weyl's Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper argues that Weyl's interpretation of quantified formulas should not be conflated with Hilbert's. The epistemic obligation to judge correctly, to which Weyl was deeply committed, suggests an interpretation of quantified formulas as generating deontic obligations to act in ways that expand the repository of correct judgments. This justifies the claim that Weyl conceived of transfinite mathematics as a normative system - a normative extension of elementary mathematics, and clarifies his semantic reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle.</description>
