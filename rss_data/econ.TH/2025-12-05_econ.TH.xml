      <title>A 'Turtle Model' of Food System Transformations: Embracing Citizens' Diverse Values and Knowledge in Change Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the challenges and opportunities of transitioning towards sustainable food systems through the lens of democratic food governance fostering inclusive and systemic transformation. Drawing on concepts of wicked problems and systems thinking, we propose a theory of change represented as a 'turtle model' that embraces the diversity of citizens' values and knowledge to highlight multiple avenues of transformation. As quadruple helix innovation and governance hubs, cities can be hotspots for food system transformations. We illustrate this for Dublin, Ireland, where local citizens' value-based food identities were galvanized to activate ecological awareness and promote sustainable seafood consumption. Within this democratic food governance framework, approaches such as open science, transdisciplinarity, and citizen engagement are fit-for-purpose to engage diverse food actors from government, industry, academia, and civil society in shared dialogue and action to transform food systems.</description>

      <title>Side-by-side first-price auctions with imperfect bidders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model a procurement scenario in which two \textit{imperfect} bidders act simultaneously on behalf of a single buyer, a configuration common in display advertising and referred to as \textit{side-by-side bidding} but largely unexplored in theory. We prove that the iterated best response algorithm converges to an equilibrium under standard distributional assumptions and provide sufficient condition for uniqueness. Beyond establishing existence and convergence, our analysis provides a tractable numerical method for quantitative studies of side-by-side procurement.</description>

      <title>Fisher Meets Lindahl: A Unified Duality Framework for Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium for public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market equilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the theoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially underdeveloped.
  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria. We show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher market equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa. The dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence between the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and prices.
  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation and dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments for Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze welfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we prove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For concave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves $(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is tight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including proportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\^atonnement. We obtain new market dynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher market. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements utilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the duality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private chores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the "poles" issue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also initiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores.</description>
