      <title>Sectional Category and the parametrized Borsuk-Ulam property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for fibrations $p:E\to B$, $p':E'\to B$ over $B$ and a free involution $\tau:E\to E$ which satisfy the equality $p\circ\tau=p$, we discover a connection between the sectional category of the double covers $q:E\to E/\tau$ and $q^Y:F_{p'}(E',2)\to F_{p'}(E',2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ from the $2$-ordered fibre-wise configuration space $F_{p'}(E',2)$ to its unordered quotient $ F_{p'}(E',2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the parametrized Borsuk-Ulam property (PBUP) for the triple $\left((p,\tau);p'\right)$. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the triple $\left((p,\tau);p'\right)$ satisfies the PBUP if the sectional category of $q$ is bigger than the sectional category of $q^{p'}$. This property connects a standard problem in parametrized Borsuk-Ulam theory to current research trends in sectional category. As applictions of our results, we explore the PBUP for $E, E'$ one of the following fibrations: trivial fibration, Hopf fibration and the Fadell-Neuwirth fibration.</description>

      <title>The algebraic Novikov spectral sequence for topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $\mathbb{C}$-motivic Adams spectral sequence for $\mathit{mmf}/\tau$. Up to reindexing, this spectral sequence is isomorphic to the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence for topological modular forms. We give a full analysis of the inclusion and projection maps which occur in the long exact sequence induced by multiplication by $\tau$ on Adams $E_2$-pages. Our computation is totally algebraic and can be used to obtain the $E_2$-page of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for topological modular forms in a way that is independent from previous computations using the elliptic curves Hopf algebroid.</description>

      <title>Cohomology ring of non-compact abelian arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a Orlik-Solomon type presentation for the cohomology ring of arrangements in a non-compact abelian Lie group. The new insight consists in comparing arrangements in different abelian groups. Our work is based on the Varchenko-Gelfand ring for real hyperplane arrangements and from that we deduce the cohomology rings of all other abelian arrangements. As by-product, we obtain a new proof of the Orlik-Solomon relations and De Concini-Procesi ones.</description>

      <title>Ky Fan theorem for sphere bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic Ky Fan theorem is a combinatorial equivalent of Borsuk-Ulam theorem. It is a generalization and extension of Tucker's lemma and, just like its predecessor, it pinpoints important properties of antipodal colorings of vertices of a triangulated sphere $S^n$. Here we describe generalizations of Ky Fan theorem for the case when the sphere is replaced by the total space of a triangulated sphere bundle.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances from simply connected geodesic spaces to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of fixed points for continuous maps $f$ from an $n$-ball $X$ in $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq 1$. We show that $f$ has a fixed point if, for some absolute retract $Y\subset\partial X$, $f(Y)\subset X$ and $\partial X-Y$ is an $(f, X)$-blockading set. For $n\geq 2$, let $D$ be an $n$-ball in $X$ and $Y$ be an $(n-1)$-ball in $\partial X$. Relying on the result just mentioned, we show the existence of a fixed point of $f$, if $D$ and $Y$ are well placed and behave well under $f$, and ${\rm deg}(f_D)=-{\rm deg}(f_{\partial Y})$, where $f_D=f|D: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f_{\partial Y}=f|\partial Y: \partial Y \rightarrow \partial Y$. The degree ${\rm deg}(f_D)$ of $f_D$ is explicitly defined and some elementary properties of which are investigated. These results extend the Brouwer fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Rigidification of connective comodules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.09398v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{k}$ be a commutative ring with global dimension zero. We show that we can rigidify homotopy coherent comodules in connective modules over the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of $\mathbb{k}$. That is, the $\infty$-category of homotopy coherent comodules is represented by a model category of strict comodules in non-negative chain complexes over $\mathbb{k}$. These comodules are over a coalgebra that is strictly coassociative and simply connected. The rigidification result allows us to derive the notion of cotensor product of comodules and endows the $\infty$-category of comodules with a symmetric monoidal structure via the two-sided cobar resolution.</description>

Abstract: We provide examples of inductive fibrant replacements in fibrantly generated model categories constructed as Postnikov towers. These provide new types of arguments to compute homotopy limits in model categories. We provide examples for simplicial and differential graded comodules. Our main application is to show that simplicial comodules and connective differential graded comodules are Quillen equivalent and their derived cotensor products correspond. We deduce that the rational $A$-theory of a simply connected space $X$ is equivalent to the $K$-theory of perfect chain complexes with a $C_*(X; \mathbb{Q})$-comodule structure.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Betti numbers and Generalized Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commutative diagrams of vector spaces and linear maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$ are objects of interest in topological data analysis (TDA) where this type of diagrams are called 2-parameter persistence modules. Given that quiver representation theory tells us that such diagrams are of wild type, studying informative invariants of a 2-parameter persistence module $M$ is of central importance in TDA. One of such invariants is the generalized rank invariant, recently introduced by Kim and M\'emoli. Via the M\"obius inversion of the generalized rank invariant of $M$, we obtain a collection of connected subsets $I\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ with signed multiplicities. This collection generalizes the well known notion of persistence barcode of a persistence module over $\mathbb{R}$ from TDA. In this paper we show that the bigraded Betti numbers of $M$, a classical algebraic invariant of $M$, are obtained by counting the corner points of these subsets $I$s. Along the way, we verify that an invariant of 2-parameter persistence modules called the interval decomposable approximation (introduced by Asashiba et al.) also encodes the bigraded Betti numbers in a similar fashion. We also show that the aforementioned results are optimal in the sense that they cannot be extended to $d$-parameter persistence modules for $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Rank Invariant: M\"obius invertibility, Discriminating Power, and Connection to Other Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike one-parameter persistent homology, the absence of a canonical method for quantifying `persistence' in multiparameter persistent homology remains a hurdle in its application. One of the best known quantifications of persistence for multiparameter persistent homology is the rank invariant, which has recently evolved into the generalized rank invariant by naturally extending its domain. This extension enables us to quantify 'persistence' across a broader range of regions in the indexing poset compared to the rank invariant.
  However, the size of the domain of the generalized rank invariant is generally formidable, making it desirable to restrict its domain to a more manageable subset for computational purposes. The foremost questions regarding such a restriction of the domain are: (1) How to restrict, if possible, the domain of the generalized rank invariant without any loss of information? (2) When can we more compactly encode the generalized rank invariant as a `persistence diagram'? (3) What is the trade-off between computational efficiency and the discriminating power of the generalized rank invariant as the amount of the restriction on the domain varies?
  To address these questions, we generalize and axiomatize the classic fundamental lemma of persistent homology via the notion of M\"obius invertibility of the generalized rank invariant which we propose. This extension also contextualizes known results regarding the (generalized) rank invariant within the classical theory of M\"obius inversion. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between M\"obius invertibility and other existing concepts related to the structural simplicity of persistence modules, such as Miller's notion of tameness. During this investigation, we identify an example of a persistence module whose generalized rank invariant is not M\"obius invertible.</description>

Abstract: We dualize previous work on generalized persistence diagrams for filtrations to cofiltrations. When the underlying space is a manifold, we express this duality as a Poincar\'e duality between their generalized persistence diagrams. A heavy emphasis is placed on the recent discovery of functoriality of the generalized persistence diagram and its connection to Rota's Galois Connection Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hochschild homology is a classical invariant of rings that plays an important role because of its connection to algebraic $K$-theory via the Dennis trace. At level zero, the Dennis trace is induced by the Hattori-Stallings trace. In this paper, we introduce new algebraic $K$-theories of coalgebras and obtain coalgebraic refinements of the Hattori-Stallings trace that connect these algebraic $K$-theories to coHochschild homology (the invariant analogous to Hochschild homology but for coalgebras). We employ bicategorical methods of Ponto to show that coHochschild homology is a shadow. Consequently, we obtain that coHochschild homology is Morita-Takeuchi invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the axiomatic study of affine oriented matroids (AOMs) on arbitrary ground sets, obtaining fundamental notions such as minors, reorientations and a natural embedding into the frame work of Complexes of Oriented Matroids. The restriction to the finitary case (FAOMs) allows us to study tope graphs and covector posets, as well as to view FAOMs as oriented finitary semimatroids. We show shellability of FAOMs and single out the FAOMs that are affinely homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we study group actions on AOMs, whose quotients in the case of FAOMs are a stepping stone towards a general theory of affine and toric pseudoarrangements. Our results include applications of the multiplicity Tutte polynomial of group actions of semimatroids, generalizing enumerative properties of toric arrangements to a combinatorially defined class of arrangements of submanifolds. This answers partially a question by Ehrenborg and Readdy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Kleene theorem for higher-dimensional automata. It states that the languages they recognise are precisely the rational subsumption-closed sets of finite interval pomsets. The rational operations on these languages include a gluing, for which we equip pomsets with interfaces. For our proof, we introduce higher-dimensional automata with interfaces, which are modelled as presheaves over labelled precube, and develop tools and techniques inspired by algebraic topology, such as cylinders and (co)fibrations. Higher-dimensional automata form a general model of non-interleaving concurrency, which subsumes many other approaches. Interval orders are used as models for concurrent and distributed systems where events extend in time. Our tools and techniques may therefore yield templates for Kleene theorems in various models and applications.</description>
