      <title>Pullback dynamics for a semilinear heat equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on time-varying domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in studying a non-autonomous semilinear heat equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on time-varying domains. Using a differential geometry approach with coordinate transformations technique, we will show that the non-autonomous problem on a time-varying domain is equivalent, in some sense, to a non-autonomous problem on a fixed domain. Furthermore, we intend to show the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to this problem, as well as, to extend these solutions globally. Finally, we will show the existence of pullback attractors. To the best of our knowledge, results on attractors are new even for non-autonomous semilinear heat equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on time-varying domains subject to conditions with more restrictive assumptions</description>

      <title>$L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marzo and Ortega-Cerd\`a gave geometric characterizations for $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets on the standard sphere for all $1\le p&lt;\infty$. Later, Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani further investigated $L^2$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^2$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds without boundary. In this paper, we characterize $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds with or without boundary for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Furthermore, we investigate $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures for eigenfunctions on compact manifolds without boundary, and we completely characterize them on the standard sphere $S^m$ for $p &gt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$. For the range $p &lt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$, we conjecture that $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets for eigenfunctions on the standard sphere $S^m$ are characterized by the tubular geometric control condition and we provide some evidence. These results provide new progress on an open problem raised by Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani.</description>

      <title>Subelliptic Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds and Their Convergence to Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the convergence to equilibrium of an $(h,\rho)$-subelliptic random walk on a closed, connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ associated with a subelliptic second-order differential operator $A$ on $M$. In such a random walk, $h$ roughly represents the step size and $\rho$ the speed at which it is carried out. To construct the random walk and prove the convergence result, we employ a technique due to Fefferman and Phong, which reduces the problem to the study of a constant-coefficient operator $\tilde{A}$ that is locally equivalent to our second-order subelliptic operator $A$, in the sense that the diffusion generated by $\tilde{A}$ induces a local diffusion for $A$. By using the compactness of $M$ this local diffusion can be lifted to a global diffusion, and the convergence result is then obtained via the spectral theory of the associated Markov operator.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the equations governing the motion of a fluid-filled elastic solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fluid-structure interaction problem of a viscous incompressible fluid contained in an elastic solid whose motion is not prescribed. The equations governing the motion of the solid are given by the Navier equations of linear elasticity, whereas the fluid motion is described by the Navier-Stokes equations. We prove that the governing equations admit a unique strong solution corresponding to non-zero initial data for the solid initial displacement and velocity, and for a fluid initial velocity in $H^{5/2}$.</description>

      <title>$W^{1,p}$ priori estimates for solutions of linear elliptic PDEs on subanalytic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a priori estimates for solutions of order $2$ linear elliptic PDEs in divergence form on subanalytic domains. More precisely, we study the solutions of a strongly elliptic equation $Lu=f$, with $f\in L^2(\mathcal{\Omega})$ and $Lu=div (A(x) \nabla u)$, and, given a bounded subanalytic domain $\mathcal{\Omega}$, possibly admitting non metrically conical singularities within its boundary, we provide explicit conditions on the tangent cone of the singularities of the boundary which ensure that $||u||_{ W^{1,p}(\mathcal{\Omega})}\le C||f||_{L^2(\mathcal{\Omega})}$, for some $p&gt;2$. The number $p$ depends on the geometry of the singularities of $\delta \mathcal{\Omega}$, but not on $u$.</description>

      <title>Monotone Multispecies Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel notion of $\lambda$-monotonicity for an $n$-species system of partial differential equations governed by mass-preserving flow dynamics, extending monotonicity in Banach spaces to the Wasserstein-2 metric space. We show that monotonicity implies the existence of and convergence to a unique steady state, convergence of the velocity fields and second moments, and contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric, at rates dependent on $\lambda$. In the special setting of Wasserstein-2 gradient descent of different energies for each species, we prove convergence to the unique Nash equilibrium of the associated energies and delineate the relationship between monotonicity and displacement convexity. This extends known zero-sum results in infinite-dimensional game theory to the general-sum setting. We provide a number of examples of monotone coupled gradient flow systems, including cross-diffusion, gradient flows with potentials, nonlocal interaction, linear and nonlinear diffusion, and min-max systems, and draw connections to a class of mean-field games. Numerically, we demonstrate convergence of a four-player economic model for service providers and strategic users competing in a market, and a degenerately monotone game.</description>

      <title>Existence and Nonexistence of Extremals for Trudinger-Moser inequalities with $L^p$ type perturbation on any bounded planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the perturbed Trudinger-Moser inequalities as follows:\[ S_\Omega(\lambda,p)=\sup_{u\in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega),\Vert\nabla u\Vert _{L^{2}\left( \Omega\right) }\leq 1}\int_{\Omega}\left( e^{4\pi u^{2}}-\lambda|u|^{p}\right) dx, \] where $1\leq p&lt;\infty$ and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our results demonstrate that there exists a threshold $\lambda^{\ast}(p)&gt;0$ such that $S_\Omega(\lambda,p)$ is attainable if $\lambda&lt;\lambda^{\ast}(p)$, but unattainable if $\lambda&gt;\lambda^{\ast}(p)$ when $p\in[1,2]$. For $p&gt;2$, however, we show that $S_\Omega(\lambda,p)$ is always attainable for any $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$. These results are achieved through a refined blow-up analysis, which allow us to establish a sharp Dirichlet energy expansion formula for sequences of solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. The asymmetric nature of our problem poses significant challenges to our analysis. To address these, we will establish an appropriate comparison principle between radial and non-radial solutions of the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. Our study establishes a complete characterization of how $L^p$-type perturbations influence the existence of extremals for critical Trudinger-Moser inequalities on any bounded planar domains, this extends the classical Brezis-Nirenberg problem framework to the two-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck duality and sparse minimizing in spaces of Sobolev solutions to elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an instructive example of using Banach spaces of solutions to (linear, generally, non-scalar) elliptic operator $A$ to investigate variational inverse problems related to neural networks and/or to regularization of solutions to boundary value problems. More precisely, inspired by kernel's method for optimization problems in locally convex spaces, we prove the existence of the so-called sparse minimizers for the related variational problem and produce a representer theorem where a suitable fundamental solution of the operator $A$ is used as a reproducing kernel. The Grothendieck type duality for the Sobolev spaces of solutions to elliptic operator $A$ plays an essential role in the considerations. The case where the number of data passes to infinity is also discussed. Some typical situations related to the standard elliptic operators, the corresponding function spaces and fundamental solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for discrete bi-Laplace operators with potentials on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the discrete Laplace operator $\Delta$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies the following sharp time decay estimate: $$\big\|e^{it\Delta}\big\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0,$$ which is slower than the usual $ O(|t|^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ decay in the continuous case on $\mathbb{R}$. However, this paper shows that the discrete bi-Laplacian $\Delta^2$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ actually exhibits the same sharp decay estimate $|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ as its continuous counterpart.
  In view of the free decay estimate, we further investigate the discrete bi-Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $H=\Delta^2+V$ on the lattice space $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, where $V$ is a class of real-valued decaying potentials on $\mathbb{Z}$. First, we establish the limiting absorption principle for $H$, and then derive the full asymptotic expansions of the resolvent of $H$ near the thresholds $0$ and $16$, including resonance cases. In particular, we provide a complete characterizations of the different resonance types in $\ell^2$-weighted spaces.
  Based on these results above, we establish the following sharp $\ell^1-\ell^{\infty}$ decay estimates for all different resonances types of $H$ under suitable decay conditions on $V$: $$\big\|e^{-itH}P_{ac}(H)\big\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}},\quad t\neq0,$$ where $P_{ac}(H)$ denotes the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H$. Additionally, the decay estimates for the evolution flow of discrete beam equation are also derived: $$\|{\cos}(t\sqrt H)P_{ac}(H)\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}+\Big\|\frac{{\sin}(t\sqrt H)}{t\sqrt H}P_{ac}(H)\Big\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0.$$</description>

      <title>Ionic KdV structure in weakly collisional plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional ions dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas governed by the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system under the Boltzmann relation with the small collision frequency $\nu&gt;0$. It is observed in physical experiments that the interplay of nonlinearities and dispersion may lead to the formation of ion acoustic solitons that are described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, to capture the ionic KdV structure in the weak-collision regime, we study the combined cold-ions limit and longwave limit of the rescaled VPL system depending on a small scaling parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$. The main goal is to justify the uniform convergence of the VPL solutions to the KdV solutions over any finite time interval as $\epsilon\to 0$ under restriction that $\epsilon^{3/2}\lesssim \nu \lesssim \epsilon^{1/2}$. The proof is based on the energy method near local Maxwellians for making use of the Euler-Poisson dynamics under the longwave scaling. The KdV profiles, in particular including both velocity field and electric potential, may have large amplitude, which induces the cubic velocity growth. To overcome the $\epsilon$-singularity in such multi-parameter limit problem, we design delicate velocity weighted energy functional and dissipation rate functional in the framework of macro-micro decomposition that is further incorporated with the Caflisch's decomposition. As an application of our approach, the global-in-time existence of solutions near global Maxwellians when the KdV profile is degenerate to a constant equilibrium is also established under the same scaling with $\epsilon^{3}\lesssim \nu \lesssim \epsilon^{5/2}$. For the proof, the velocity weight is modified to depend on the solution itself, providing an extra quartic dissipation so as to obtain the global dynamics for most singular Coulomb potentials.</description>

      <title>Stability transitions of NLS action ground-states on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital stability of action ground-states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation over two particular cases of metric graphs, the $\mathcal{T}$ and the tadpole graphs. We show the existence of stability transitions near the $L^2$-critical exponent, a new dynamical feature of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. More precisely, as the frequency $\lambda$ increases, the action ground-state transitions from stable to unstable and then back to stable (or vice-versa).
  This result is complemented with the stability analysis of ground-states in the asymptotic cases of low/high frequency and weak/strong nonlinear interaction. Finally, we present a numerical simulation of the stability of action ground-states depending on the nonlinearity and the frequency parameter, which validates the aforementioned theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Semiregular and strongly irregular boundary points for nonlocal Dirichlet problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study nonlocal nonlinear equations of fractional $(s,p)$-Laplacian type on $\mathbf{R}^n$. We show that the irregular boundary points for the Dirichlet problem can be divided into two disjoint classes: semiregular and strongly irregular boundary points, with very different behaviour. Two fundamental tools needed to show this are the Kellogg property (from our previous paper) and a new removability result for solutions in the $V^{s,p}$ Sobolev type space, which we deduce more generally also for supersolutions of equations with a right-hand side. Semiregular and strongly irregular points are also characterized in various ways. Finally, it is explained how semiregularity depends on $s$ and $p$.</description>

      <title>Global Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for asymptotically convex fully nonlinear Grad-Mercier type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Dirichlet problem for the fully nonlinear elliptic equation of Grad-Mercier type under asymptotic convexity conditions \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  F(D^2u(x),Du(x),u(x),x)=g(|\{y\in \Omega:u(y)\ge u(x)\}|)+f(x) &amp; \text{in } \Omega,
  u=\psi &amp;\text{on } \partial \Omega.
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} In order to overcome the non-convexity of the operator $F$ and the nonlocality of the nonhomogeneous term $g$, we apply the compactness methods and frozen technique to prove the existence of the $W^{2,p}$-viscosity solutions and the global $W^{2,p}$ estimate. As an application, we derive a Cordes-Nirenberg type continuous estimate up to boundary. Furthermore, we establish a global BMO estimate for the second derivatives of solutions by using an asymptotic approach, thereby refining the borderline case of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimates.</description>

      <title>Approximate Synchronization of Memristive Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic synchronization is one of the essential differences between artificial neural networks and biologically inspired neural networks due to mismatches from dynamical update of weight parameters and heterogeneous activations. In this paper a new concept of approximate synchronization is proposed and investigated for Hopfield neural networks coupled with nonlinear memristors. It is proved that global solution dynamics are robustly dissipative and a sharp ultimate bound is acquired. Through \emph{a priori} uniform estimates on the interneuron differencing equations, it is rigorously shown that approximate synchronization to any prescribed small gap at an exponential convergence rate of the memristive Hopfield neural networks occurs if an explicitly computable threshold condition is satisfied by the interneuron coupling strength coefficient. The main result is further extended to memristive Hopfield neural networks with Hebbian learning rules for a broad range of applications in unsupervised train learning.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the 2-D isentropic Euler Equations for a generalized polytropic gas law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we developed an analysis of the compressible, isentropic Euler equations in two spatial dimensions for a generalized polytropic gas law. The main focus is rotational flows in the subsonic regimes, described through the framework of the Euler equations expressed in self-similar variables and pseudo-velocities. A Bernoulli type equation is derived, serving as a cornerstone for establishing a self-similar system tailored to rotational flows. In the final section, the study extends to an analysis of a perturbed model, introducing the concept of quasi-potential flows, offering insights into their behavior and implications.</description>

      <title>Yudovich theory under geometric regularity for density-dependent incompressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of the density-dependent incompressible Euler equations in space dimension $d=2$, for low regularity (\textsl{i.e.} non-Lipschitz) initial data satisfying assumptions in spirit of the celebrated Yudovich theory for the classical homogeneous Euler equations.
  We show that, under an \textsl{a priori} control of a non-linear geometric quantity, namely the directional derivative $\partial_Xu$ of the fluid velocity $u$ along the vector field $X:=\nabla^\perp\rho$, where $\rho$ is the fluid density, low regularity solutions \textsl{\`a la Yudovich} can be constructed also in the non-homogeneous setting. More precisely, we prove the following facts:
  (i) \emph{stability}: given a sequence of smooth approximate solutions enjoying a uniform control on the above mentioned geometric quantity, then (up to an extraction) that sequence converges to a Yudovich-type solution of the density-dependent incompressible Euler system; \\ (ii) \emph{uniqueness}: there exists at most one Yudovich-type solution of the density-dependent incompressible Euler equations such that $\partial_Xu$ remains finite; besides, this statement improves previous uniqueness results for regular solutions, inasmuch as it requires less smoothness on the initial data.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of an indefinite spectral problem arising in population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an indefinite spectral problem for a second-order self-adjoint elliptic operator in an asymptotically thin cylinder. The operator coefficients and the spectral density function are assumed to be locally periodic in the axial direction of the cylinder. The key assumption is that the spectral density function changes sign, which leads to infinitely many both positive and negative eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of the spectrum, as the thickness of the rod tends to zero, depends essentially on the sign of the average of the density function. We study the positive part of the spectrum in a specific case when the local average is negative. We derive a one-dimensional effective spectral problem that is a harmonic oscillator on the real line, and prove the convergence of spectrum. A key auxiliary result is the existence of a positive principal eigenvalue of an indefinite spectral problem with the Neumann boundary condition on a periodicity cell. This study is motivated by applications in population genetics where spectral problems with sign-changing weight naturally appear.</description>

      <title>On Exponential Instability of an Inverse Problem for the Wave Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a time-independent potential $q\in L^\infty$, consider the source-to-solution operator that maps a source $f$ to the solution $u=u(t,x)$ of $(\Box+q)u=f$ in Euclidean space with an obstacle, where we impose on $u$ vanishing Cauchy data at $t=0$ and vanishing Dirichlet data at the boundary of the obstacle. We study the inverse problem of recovering the potential $q$ from this source-to-solution map restricted to some measurement domain. By giving an example where measurements take place in some subset and the support of $q$ lies in the `shadow region' of the obstacle, we show that recovery of $q$ is exponentially unstable.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional structural stability of shock waves in elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional structural stability of shock waves for the equations of elastodynamics governing isentropic flows of compressible inviscid elastic materials. By nonlinear structural stability of a shock wave we mean the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of the discontinuous shock front solution to the hyperbolic system of elastodynamics. By using equivalent formulations of the uniform and weak Kreiss-Lopatinski conditions for 1-shocks, we show that planar shock waves in three-dimensional elastodynamics are always at least weakly stable, and we find a condition necessary and sufficient for their uniform stability. Since the system of elastodynamics satisfies the Agranovich-Majda-Osher block structure condition, uniform stability implies structural stability of corresponding nonplanar shock waves. We also show that, as in isentropic gas dynamics, all compressive shock waves are uniformly stable for convex equations of state. This paper is a natural continuation of the previous two-dimensional analysis in [Morando A., Trakhinin Y., Trebeschi P., Math. Ann. 378 (2020), 1471-1504; Trakhinin Y., J. Hyperbolic Differ. Equ. 19 (2022), 157-173]. As in the two-dimensional case, we make the conclusion that the elastic force plays stabilizing role for uniform stability.</description>

      <title>Constraint Maps: Insights and Related Themes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores recent progress related to constraint maps. Building on the exposition in [14], our goal is to provide a clear and accessible account of some of the more intricate arguments behind the main results in this work. Along the way, we include several new results of independent value. In particular, we give optimal geometric conditions on the target manifold that guarantee a unique continuation result for the projected image map. We also prove that the gradient of a minimizing harmonic map (or, more generally, of a minimizing constraint map) is an $A_\infty$-weight, and therefore satisfies a strong form of the unique continuation principle. In addition, we outline possible directions for future research and highlight several open problems that may interest researchers working on free boundary problems and harmonic maps.</description>

      <title>A doubly nonlinear elliptic problem with variable exponents, homogeneous Neumann conditions and generalized logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to prove existence and uniqueness results for a doubly nonlinear elliptic problem that is essential for solving the associated parabolic problem using Rothe's method (discretizing time). We work under very weak assumptions, dropping the commonly used condition that the source term is locally Lipschitz, which appears frequently in the literature. Instead, we rely on the continuity of the Nemytskii operator between two Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents. All results presented here are proved in full detail, which makes the article lengthy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we give the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the weak form of a two-surfaces contact problem using fixed point approach. We begin by modeling the evolution of a two deformable surfaces contact problem with a general viscoplastic law, the contact is considered frictionless and governed by the Signorini-type condition with an initial gap. Then, we derive the variational formulation of the classical problem. Finally, we conclude our work by establishing an existence and uniqueness theorem for the weak form.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity exponential stability for Lions-Feireisl's weak solutions to the three-dimensional Barotropic Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with large Potential Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23807v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the large-time behavior for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large external force in 3D bounded domain. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional and using the extra integrability of the density, we state the exponentially decay-in-time to the equilibrium state for Lions-Feireisl's finite-energy weak solutions. In addition, some careful discussion on Taylor expansion also plays a crucial role in our analysis. The main difficulty lies in the fact that the equilibrium state of density is not a constant anymore induced by the large external force. It should be noted that our result can be regarded as an extension of \cite{PSW} to large potential forces case.</description>

Abstract: We prove uniform-in-time a priori $H^s$ bounds for solutions to the intermediate long wave equation posed both on the line and on the circle, covering the range $-\frac12&lt;s\leq0$. Additionally, we prove that the set of orbits emanating from a bounded and equicontinuous set in $H^s$ is also bounded and equicontinuous in $H^s$. Our proof is based on the identification of a suitable Lax pair formulation for the intermediate long wave equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variational approach to solve parabolic problems by minimising a functional over time and space. To achieve existence results we investigate the notion of $\mathscr{A}$-quasiconvexity for non-homogeneous operators in anisotropic spaces. The abstract theory is then applied to formulate a variational solution concept for the non-Newtonian Navier--Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the no-response test for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain sampling methods called the range test (RT) and no-response test (NRT), and their duality are known for several inverse scattering problems and an inverse boundary value problem for the Laplace operator (see Section 1 for more details). In our previous work [21], we established the duality between the NRT and RT, and demonstrated the convergence of the RT for the heat equation. We also provided numerical studies for both methods. However, we did not address the convergence for the NRT. As a continuation of this work, we prove the convergence of the NRT without using the duality. Specifically, assuming there exists a cavity $D$ inside a heat conductor $\Omega$, we define an indicator function $I_{NRT}(G)$ for a prescribed test domain $G$, where $\overline G\subset\Omega$ (i.e., $G\Subset\Omega$). By using the analytical extension property of solutions to the heat equation with respect to the spatial variables, we prove the convergence result given as $I_{NRT}(G)&lt;\infty$ if and only if $\overline{D}\subset \overline{G}$, provided that the solution to the heat equation cannot be analytically extended across the boundary of the cavity. Thus, we complete the theoretical study of both methods. Here the analytic extension of solutions does not require the property that the solutions are real analytic with respect to the space variables. However, for the proof of the mentioned convergence result, we fully use this property.</description>

      <title>Boundary Value Problems in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane with $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results for the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity problems for the Laplace equation in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane, considering $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary. More specifically, we study the $L^{p,1}$-solvability for the Dirichlet problem, complementing results of Kenig (1980) and Carro and Ortiz-Caraballo (2018). Then, we study $L^p$-solvability of the Neumann problem, obtaining a range of solvability which is empty in some cases, a clear difference with the arc-length case. When it is not empty, it is an interval, and we consider solvability at its endpoints, establishing conditions for Lorentz space solvability when $p&gt;1$ and atomic Hardy space solvability when $p=1$. Solving the Lorentz endpoint leads us to a two-weight Sawyer-type inequality, for which we give a sufficient condition. Finally, we show how to adapt to the Regularity problem the results for the Neumann problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we revisit the observability of the Schr\"odinger equation on the two-dimensional torus. In contrast to the Schr\"odinger operator with a purely electric potential, for which any non-empty open set guarantees observability, the presence of a magnetic potential introduces an additional obstruction. We establish a sufficient and almost necessary geometric condition for the observability of electromagnetic Schr\"odinger operators. This condition incorporates the magnetic potential, which can also be characterized by a geometric control condition for the corresponding magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following Cauchy problem for the linear wave equation with both time-dependent friction and time-dependent viscoelastic damping: \begin{equation} \label{EqAbstract}\tag{$\ast$} \begin{cases} u_{tt}- \Delta u + b(t)u_t - g(t)\Delta u_t=0, &amp;(t,x) \in (0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^n, \\ u(0,x)= u_0(x),\quad u_t(0,x)= u_1(x), &amp;x \in \mathbb{R}^n. \end{cases} \end{equation} Our goal is to derive decay estimates for higher order energy norms of solutions to this problem. We focus on the interplay between the time-dependent coefficients in both damping terms and their influence on the qualitative behavior of solutions. The analysis is based on a classification of the damping mechanisms, frictional damping $b(t)u_t$ and viscoelastic damping $-g(t)\Delta u_t$ as well, and employs the WKB-method in the extended phase space.</description>

Abstract: We show that the real-analytic matrix-weighted double fibration transform determines the analytic wavefront set of a vector-valued function. We apply this result to show that the matrix weighted ray transform is injective on a two-dimensional, non-trapping, real-analytic Riemannian manifold with strictly convex boundary. Additionally, we show that a real-analytic Higgs field can be uniquely determined from the nonabelian ray transform on real-analytic Riemannian manifolds of any dimension with a strictly convex boundary point.</description>

      <title>On the controllability of laminated beams with Venttsel-type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the boundary controllability of a Timoshenko laminated beam system subject to Venttsel-type boundary conditions. The study focuses on a novel configuration in which three controls are applied solely at the boundary of the beam. Controllability is established by deriving an appropriate observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint system, which is then employed within the framework of the duality method in the setup of the classical Hilbert uniqueness method (HUM) to achieve the control problem. The main contribution lies in the analysis of a system comprising three beams governed by dynamic Venttsel-type boundary conditions, as introduced by Venttsel in [Theory Probab. Appl., 4 (1959)].</description>

Abstract: Quantifying the convergence rate of the underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) is a classical topic, in large part due to the possibility for diffusive-to-ballistic speedups -- as was recently established for the continuous-time dynamics via space-time Poincare inequalities. A central challenge for analyzing ULD is that its degeneracy necessitates the development of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. In this paper, we give a new coupling-based framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical discretizations. First, in the continuous-time setting, we use this framework to establish new parabolic Harnack inequalities for ULD. These are the first Harnack inequalities that decay to zero in contractive settings, thereby reflecting the convergence properties of ULD in addition to just its regularity properties.
  Second, we build upon these Harnack inequalities to develop a local error framework for analyzing discretizations of ULD in KL divergence. This extends our framework in part III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity. Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD establishes (i) the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number), and (ii) the first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total variation error in dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>A notion of BSDE on the Wasserstein space and its applications to control problems and PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) on the Wasserstein space of probability measures. This formulation extends the classical correspondence between BSDEs, stochastic control, and partial differential equations (PDEs) to the mean--field (McKean--Vlasov) setting, where the dynamics depend on the law of the state process. The standard BSDE framework becomes inadequate in this context, motivating a new definition in terms of measure--dependent solutions.
  Under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate that this formulation is in correspondence with both mean--field control problems and partial differential equations defined on the Wasserstein space. A comparison principle is established to ensure uniqueness, and existence results are obtained for generators that are linear or quadratic in the $z$--variable. This framework provides a probabilistic approach to control and analysis on the space of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Uncentered Fractional Maximal functions and mean oscillation spaces associated with dyadic Hausdorff content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action of uncentered fractional maximal functions on mean oscillation spaces associated with the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta}$ with $0&lt;\beta\leq n$. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$, we refine existing results concerning the action of the Euclidean uncentered fractional maximal function $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ on the functions of bounded mean oscillations (BMO) and vanishing mean oscillations (VMO). In addition, for $0 &lt; \beta_1 \leq \beta_2 \leq n$, we establish the boundedness of the $\beta_2$-dimensional uncentered maximal function $\mathcal{M}^{\beta_2}$ on the space $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ denotes the mean oscillation space adapted to the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta_1}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system on smooth domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new assumption (1.2) that involves a small oscillation and $C^2$ norms for maps from smooth bounded domains into Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, by assuming that the domain has non-negative Ricci curvature, we establish the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system via the mean curvature flow (MCF) with boundary. The long-time existence of such flow is derived using Bernstein-type theorems of higher codimensional self-shrinkers in the whole space and the half-space. Another novel aspect is that our hypothesis imposes no restriction on the diameter of the domains, which implies an existence result for an exterior Dirichlet problem of the minimal surface system.</description>

Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions on weights $u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2$, i.e. measurable, positive, and finite, a.e. on $(a,b)$, for which there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for given $0 &lt; p_1,q_1,p_2,q_2 &lt;\infty$ the inequality \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_2} v_2(s)^{p_2} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_2}{p_2}} u_2(t)^{q_2} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_2}}&amp; \\ &amp; \hspace{-3cm}\le C \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_1} v_1(s)^{p_1} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}} u_1(t)^{q_1} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_1}} \end{split} \end{equation*} holds for every non-negative, measurable function $f$ on $(a,b)$, where $0 \le a &lt;b \le \infty$. The proof is based on a recently developed discretization method that enables us to overcome the restrictions of the earlier results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably) new results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of (affine) subspaces.</description>

      <title>Generalised Fisher Information in Defective Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to introduce and investigate a \textit{generalised Fisher Information} in the setting of linear Fokker-Planck equations. This functional, which depends on two functions instead of one, exhibits the same decay behaviour as the standard Fisher information, and allows us to investigate different parts of the Fokker-Planck solution via an appropriate decomposition. Focusing almost exclusively on Fokker-Planck equations with constant drift and diffusion matrices, we will use a modification of the well established Bakry-Emery method with this newly defined functional to provide an alternative proof to the sharp long time behaviour of relative entropies of solutions to such equations when the diffusion matrix is positive definite and the drift matrix is defective. This novel approach is different to previous techniques and relies on minimal spectral information on the Fokker-Planck operator, unlike the one presented the authors' previous work, where powerful tools from spectral theory were needed.</description>

Similar techniques apply to the Limiting Absorption Principles for certain elliptic (pseudo-)differential operators with constant coefficients. In this way we obtain a richer existence theory for Helmholtz-type problems on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with block-radial right hand sides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the set of semiclassical measures corresponding to sequences of eigenfunctions of the attractive Coulomb operator $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}:=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3}-\frac{1}{|x|}$. In particular, any Radon probability measure on the fixed negative energy hypersurface $\Sigma_E$ of the Kepler Hamiltonian $H$ in classical phase space that is invariant under the regularized Kepler flow is the semiclassical measure of a sequence of eigenfunctions of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ with eigenvalue $E$ as $\hbar \to 0$. The main tool that we use is the celebrated Fock unitary conjugation map between eigenspaces of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ and $-\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^3}$. We first prove that for any Kepler orbit $\gamma$ on $\Sigma_E$, there is a sequence of eigenfunctions that converge in the sense of semiclassical measures to the delta measure supported on $\gamma$ as $\hbar \to 0$, and we finish using a density argument in the weak-* topology.</description>

Abstract: Singular steady states are important objects in obtaining ill-posedness results for 2D incompressible Euler equations. In \cite{elgindi2022regular}, a family of singular steady states near the Bahouri-Chemin patch was introduced. In this paper, we obtain the optimal convergence results for the singular steady states constructed in \cite{elgindi2022regular} to the Bahouri-Chemin patch. We first derive a boundary Harnack principle, and then obtain the optimal convergence results using the singular integral representation based on Green's function.</description>

      <title>Global solvability for the heat equations in two half spaces and an interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the existence of a global-in-time strong solution to the heat equations in the two half spaces $\mathbb{R}^3_+(=\mathbb{R}^2 \times (0,\infty))$, $\mathbb{R}^3_-(= \mathbb{R}^2 \times (-\infty ,0))$, and the interface $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \{ 0 \} (\cong \mathbb{R}^2)$. We introduce and study some function spaces in the two half spaces and the interface. We apply our function spaces and the maximal $L^p$-regularity for Hilbert space-valued functions to show the existence of a local-in-time strong solution to our heat equations. By using an energy equality of our heat system, we prove the existence of a unique global-in-time strong solution to the system with large initial data. The key idea of constructing strong solutions to our system is to make use of nice properties of the heat semigroups and kernels for $\mathbb{R}^3_+$, $\mathbb{R}^3_{-}$, and $\mathbb{R}^2$. In Appendix, we derive our heat equations in the two half spaces and the interface from an energetic point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any sequence of vanishing viscosity Leray-Hopf solutions to the periodic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations does not display anomalous dissipation if the initial vorticity is a measure with positive singular part. A key step in the proof is the use of the Delort-Majda concentration-compactness argument to exclude formation of atoms in the vorticity measure, which in particular implies that the limiting velocity is an admissible weak solution to Euler. This is the first result proving absence of dissipation in a class of solutions in which the velocity fails to be strongly compact in $L^2$, putting two-dimensional turbulence in sharp contrast with respect to that in three dimensions. Moreover, our proof reveals that the amount of energy dissipation can be bounded by the vorticity measure of a disk of size $\sqrt \nu$, matching the two-dimensional Kolmogorov dissipative length scale which is expected to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the nearly self-similar blowup of the generalized axisymmetric Navier--Stokes equations. First, we rigorously derive the axisymmetric Navier--Stokes equations with swirl in both odd and even dimensions, marking the first such derivation for dimensions greater than three. Building on this, we generalize the equations to arbitrary positive real-valued dimensions, preserving many known properties of the 3D axisymmetric Navier--Stokes equations. To address scaling instability, we dynamically vary the space dimension to balance advection scaling along the r and z directions. A major contribution of this work is the development of a novel two-scale dynamic rescaling formulation, leveraging the dimension as an additional degree of freedom. This approach enables us to demonstrate a one-scale self-similar blowup with solution-dependent viscosity. Notably, the self-similar profile satisfies the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity. We observe that the effective dimension is approximately 3.188 and appears to converge toward 3 as background viscosity diminishes. Furthermore, we introduce a rescaled Navier--Stokes model derived by dynamically rescaling the axial velocity in 3D. This model retains essential properties of 3D Navier-Stokes. Our numerical study shows that this rescaled Navier--Stokes model with two constant viscosity coefficients exhibits a nearly self-similar blowup with maximum vorticity growth on the order of O(10^{30}).</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis for a system of singular amplitude equations arising in biomorphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear stability of exponential periodic solutions of a system of singular amplitude equations associated with convective Turing bifurcation in the presence of conservation laws, as arises in modern biomorphology models, binary fluids, and elsewhere. Consisting of a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled with a singular convection-diffusion equation in "mean modes" associated with conservation laws, these were shown previously by the authors to admit a constant-coefficient linearized stability analysis as in the classical Ginzburg-Landau case -- albeit now singular in wave amplitude epsilon -- yielding useful necessary conditions for stability, both of the exponential functions as solutions of the amplitude equations, and of the associated periodic pattern solving the underlying PDE. Here, we show by a delicate two-parameter matrix perturbation analysis that (strict) satisfaction of these necessary conditions is also sufficient for diffusive stability in the sense of Schneider, yielding a corresponding result, and nonlinear stability, for the underlying PDE. Moreover, we show that they may be interpreted as stability along a non-normally hyperbolic slow manifold approximated by Darcy-type reduction, together with attraction along transverse mean modes, connecting with finite-time approximation theorems of Hacker-Schneider-Zimmerman.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear backward parabolic SPDEs in bounded domains and present new a priori estimates for their weak solutions. Inspired by the seminal work of Y. Hu, J. Ma and J. Yong from 2002 on strong solutions, we establish $L^p$-estimates requiring minimal assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients, the terminal data, and the external force. Our approach relies on direct, constructive, and quantitative arguments, adapted from known methods in the theory of SPDEs to this setting. In particular, we develop a new It\^{o}'s formula for the $L^p$-norm of the backward solution, tailored to this setting and extending the classical result in the $L^2$-framework. This formula is then used to improve further the regularity of the first component of the solution up to $L^\infty$. We also present two applications: a local existence result for a semilinear equation without imposing any growth condition on the nonlinear term, and a novel local controllability result for semilinear backward SPDEs that partially resolves an open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and numerical solutions of the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17043v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation with excitations located within a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \in \{2,3\}$, subject to Robin boundary conditions. This problem is of particular interest for advancing imaging techniques that exploit nonlinearity of the acoustic propagation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in both the linear and the nonlinear setting, thereby allowing for spatially varying coefficients as relevant in quantitative imaging. Derivation of a multiharmonic formulation enables us to show the generation of higher harmonics (that is, responses at multiples of the fundamental frequency) due nonlinear wave propagation. An iterative scheme for solving the resulting system is proposed that relies on successive resolution of these higher harmonics, and its convergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is proven. Furthermore, we investigate the numerical solution of the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, employing a conforming finite element method for its discretization. Through an implementation of the proposed methodology, we illustrate how acoustic waves propagate in nonlinear media. This study aims to enhance our understanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, which is essential for obtaining high-quality images from limited in vivo and boundary measurements.</description>

      <title>Global uniform regularity for the 3D incompressible MHD equations with slip boundary condition near an equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper solves the global conormal regularity problem for the three-dimensional incompressible MHD equations with slip boundary condition near a background magnetic field. Motivated by applications in geophysics, the MHD system considered here is anisotropic with small vertical dissipation and small horizontal magnetic diffusion. By exploiting the enhanced dissipation due to the background magnetic field and introducing three layers of energy functionals, we are able to establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of vertical viscosity and horizontal resistivity. These global conormal regularity estimates allow us to pass to the limit and obtain the convergence to the MHD system with no vertical dissipation and horizontal magnetic diffusion. In the special case of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes, explicit long-time rates are also extracted in the zero vertical viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Correction to Doi type models for suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from microscopic $N$ particle systems, we study the derivation of Doi type models for suspensions of non-spherical particles in Stokes flows. While Doi models accurately describe the effective evolution of the spatial particle density to the first order in the particle volume fraction, this accuracy fails regarding the evolution of the particle orientations. We rigorously attribute this failure to the singular interaction of the particles via a $-3$-homogeneous kernel. In the situation that the particles are initially distributed according to a stationary ergodic point process, we identify the limit of this singular interaction term. It consists of two parts. The first corresponds to a classical term in Doi type models. The second new term depends on the (microscopic) $2$-point correlation of the point process. By including this term, we provide a modification of the Doi model that is accurate to first order in the particle volume fraction.</description>

      <title>On global existence and large-time behaviour of weak solutions to the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with density-dependent bulk viscosity: beyond the Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes equations for a $\gamma$-law gas with density-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient $\lambda=\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ on the two-dimensional periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^2$. The global existence of weak solutions with initial density bounded away from zero and infinity for $\beta&gt;3$, $\gamma&gt;1$ has been established by Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov [\textit{Sib. Math. J.} 36 (1995), 1283--1316]. When $\gamma=\beta&gt;3$, the large-time behaviour of the weak solutions and, in particular, the absence of formation of vacuum and concentration of density as $t \to \infty$, has been proved by Perepelitsa [\textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 39 (2007/08), 1344--1365]. Huang--Li [\textit{J. Math. Pures Appl.} 106 (2016), 123--154] extended these results by establishing the global existence of weak solutions and large-time behaviour under the assumptions $\beta &gt;3/2$, $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, and that the initial density stays away from infinity (but may contain vacuum).
  Improving upon the works listed above, we prove that in the regime of parameters as in Huang--Li, namely that $\beta &gt;3/2$ and $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, if the density has no vacuum or concentration at $t=0$, then it stays away from zero and infinity at all later time $t \in ]0,\infty[$. Moreover, under the mere assumption that $\beta&gt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$, we establish the global existence of weak solutions, thus pushing the global existence theory of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to the most general setting to date. One of the key ingredients of our proof is a novel application -- motivated by the recent work due to Danchin--Mucha [\textit{Comm. Pure Appl. Math.} 76 (2023), 3437--3492] -- of Desjardins' logarithmic interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Spacetime decay of mild solutions and conditional quantitative transfer of regularity of the incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the "transfer of regularity" phenomenon for the incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations (NSE) in dimension $n \geq 3$; that is, the strong solutions of NSE on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be nicely approximated by those on sufficiently large domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ under the no-slip boundary condition. Based on the space-time decay estimates of mild solutions of NSE established by [On space-time decay properties of nonstationary incompressible Navier-Stokes flows in $\mathbb{R}^n$, Funkcial. Ekvac. 43 (2000);$L^2$ decay for weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 88 (1985)] and others, we obtain quantitative estimates for the ``transfer of regularity'' on higher-order derivatives of velocity and pressure under the smallness assumptions of the Stokes' system and/or the initial velocity, thus complementing the results obtained by [Using periodic boundary conditions to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the transfer of regularity, Nonlinearity 34 (2021)] and [Quantitative transfer of regularity of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations from $\Bbb R^3$ to the case of a bounded domain, J.

      <title>Refined blow-up behavior for reaction-diffusion equations with non scale invariant exponential nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider positive radial decreasing blow-up solutions of the semilinear heat equation \begin{equation*}
  u_t-\Delta u=f(u):=e^{u}L(e^{u}),\quad x\in \Omega,\ t&gt;0,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega=\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\Omega=B_R$ and $L$ is a slowly varying function
  (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating unbounded functions).
  We characterize the aymptotic blow-up behavior and obtain the sharp, global blow-up profile in the scale of the original variables $(x, t)$. Namely,
  assuming for instance $u_t\ge 0$, we have \begin{equation*}
  u(x,t)=G^{-1}\bigg(T-t+\frac{1}{8}\frac{|x|^2}{|\log |x||}\bigg)+o(1)\quad \ \hbox{as $(x,t)\to (0,T)$, where } \quad G(X)=\int_{X}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{f(s)}ds.
  \end{equation*}
  This estimate in particular provides the sharp final space profile and the refined space-time profile. For exponentially growing nonlinearities, such results were up to now available only in the scale invariant case $f(u)=e^u$. Moreover, this displays a universal structure of the global blow-up profile, given by the resolvent $G^{-1}$ of the ODE composed with a fixed time-space building block, which is robust with respect to the factor $L(e^u)$.</description>

      <title>Recovering a (1+1)-dimensional wave equation from a single white noise boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following inverse problem: Suppose a $(1+1)$-dimensional wave equation on $\mathbb{R}_+$ with zero initial conditions is excited with a Neumann boundary data modelled as a white noise process. Given also the Dirichlet data at the same point, determine the unknown first order coefficient function of the system.
  We first establish that direct problem is well-posed. The inverse problem is then solved by showing that correlations of the boundary data determine the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator in the sense of distributions, which is known to uniquely identify the coefficient. This approach has applications in acoustic measurements of internal cross-sections of fluid pipes such as pressurised water supply pipes and vocal tract shape determination.</description>

      <title>Semilinear Heat Equations in Morse-Transue Spaces and Nonlinearities of Rapid Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of well-posedness for a general class of semilinear heat equations with initial data in the Morse-Transue subspace of an Orlicz space. Significantly, we obtain our results without imposing growth restrictions on the nonlinearity or the underlying space {\em a priori}.
  The key findings are as follows: a completely new smoothing estimate for the action of the heat semigroup between two arbitrary Orlicz spaces; sufficient conditions for local and global (for small initial data) well-posedness in the Morse-Transue space; a comparison principle in the case of monotone nonlinearities; for nonlinearities enjoying additional structure (e.g. convexity) and growing sufficiently rapidly at infinity (as measured by the variation of $\log f$), an explicit characterisation of a critical Morse-Transue space for local well-posedness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel idea to study $y$-dependence for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}^n$. Unlike \cite{STNT2014}(Analysis \&amp; PDE, 2014) and \cite{HHYL2024}(SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2024), the heart of the matter is that the scaling argument is invalid. Moreover, we also consider the Cauchy problem, which transforms the variational analysis into dynamical stability results.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for a Sobolev critical quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Sobolev critical exponent:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  -\Delta u-u\Delta (u^2)+\lambda u=\tau|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2\cdot2^*-2}u,~~~~x\in\mathbb{R}^N,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  under the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2dx=c$ for some prescribed $c&gt;0$. Here $\tau\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier, $N\ge3$, $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $2&lt;q&lt;2\cdot2^*$. By deriving precise energy level estimates and establishing new convergence theorems, we apply the perturbation method to establish several existence results for $\tau&gt;0$ in the Sobolev critical regime:
  (a) For the case of $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$, we obtain the existence of two solutions, one of which is a local minimizer, and the other is a mountain pass type solution, under explicit conditions on $c&gt;0$;
  (b) For the case of $2+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}$, we obtain the existence of normalized solutions of mountain pass type under different conditions on $c&gt;0$;
  (c) For the case of $4+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;2\cdot2^*$, we obtain the existence of a ground state normalized solution under different conditions on $c&gt;0$.
  Moreover, when $\tau\le 0$, we derive the non-existence result for $2&lt;q&lt;2\cdot2^*$ and all $c&gt;0$. Our research provides a comprehensive analysis across the entire range $q\in(2, 2 \cdot 2^*)$ and for all $N\ge3$. The methods we have developed are flexible and can be extended to a broader class of nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process of $N$ stochastic particles and show that its empirical measure converges, as $N\rightarrow\infty$, to the solution of the Landau equation. We work in the regime of very soft and Coulomb potentials using a tightness/uniqueness method. To claim uniqueness, we need high integrability estimates that we obtain by crucially exploiting the dissipation of the Fisher information at the level of the particle system. To be able to exploit these estimates as $N\rightarrow\infty$, we prove the affinity in infinite dimension of the entropy production and Fisher information dissipation (and general higher-order versions of the Fisher information through an abstract theorem), results which were up to now only known for the entropy and the Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of Horospheres and Weingarten Surfaces in Hyperbolic 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive basic differential geometric formulae for surfaces in hyperbolic space represented as envelopes of horospheres. The dual notion of parallel hypersurfaces is also studied. The representation is applied to prove existence and regularity theorems for Weingarten surfaces in H^3, which satisfy (1-a)K = a(2-H), for an a &lt; 0, and have a specified boundary curve at infinity. These surfaces are shown to be closely connected to conformal mappings of domains in S^2 into the unit disk and provide Riemannian interpretations for some conformal invariants associated to such mappings.
  This paper was originally written in 1984, before I learned to use TeX, and was typed by one of the secretaries in the Princeton Math Department. It was more or less, my first original work after my dissertation. For some reason, I was not able to get this paper published in a timely manner. The results and perspective in this paper have proved to be useful to a variety of people, some of whom asked me to render the article into TeX and post it to the arXiv. I had been seriously thinking about doing this, when Martin Bridgeman sent me a transcription of my original article into TeX. I am extremely grateful to him for the effort he has put into this project.
  The paper is now formatted in a more or less modern AMS-article style, but for lots of additional punctuation, a few corrections and some minor stylistic changes, the content has been largely reproduced as it originally was. Remarks about the 'state-of-the-art' in hyperbolic geometry are obviously way out of date, as there has been enormous progress in many aspects of this still rich subject.</description>

      <title>The Second Order 2D Behaviors of a 3D Bose Gases in the Gross-Pitaevskii Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ bosons interacting in a three-dimensional box endowed with periodic boundary condition that is strongly confined in one direction such that the normalized thickness of the box $d\ll1$. We assume particles to interact through a repulsive, radially symmetric and short-range interaction potential with scattering length scale $a\ll d$. We present a comprehensive study of such system in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, up to the second order ground state energy, starting from proving optimal Bose-Einstein condensation results which were not previously available. The fine interplay between the parameters $N$, $a$ and $d$ generates three regions. Our result in one region on the one hand, is compatible with the classical three-dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang formula. On the other hand, it reveals a new mechanism exhibiting how the second order correction compensates and modifies the first order energy, which was previously thought of as containing a jump, and thus explains how a three-dimensional Bose gas system smoothly transits into two-dimensional system. Moreover, delving into the analysis of this new mechanism exclusive to the second order, we discover a dimensional coupling correlation effect, deeply buried away from the expected 3D and quasi-2D renormalizations, and calculate a new second order correction to the ground state energy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Space-time White Noise and Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). It consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 6) and the appendices (A to C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. Chapter 5 discusses asymptotic properties of the solution to the stochastic heat equation such as existence of invariant and reversible measures, convergence in law to the invariant distribution, mixing and irreducibility. In Chapter 6, we prove a theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions in the weak sense. Then we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs: the Markov field property, asymptotic bounds on moments of solutions that are useful for studying long-time behavior of the solutions, a comparison theorem for the stochastic heat equation, an introduction to potential theory for SPDEs, and a study of SPDEs with rough initial conditions.
  Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Proofs of Gap Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for turning a numerical simulation of a gap soliton in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a formal mathematical proof of its existence. These nonlinear localized solutions play a central role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We reformulate the problem of proving their existence as the search for homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system. We then apply computer-assisted proof techniques to obtain verifiable conditions under which a numerically approximated trajectory corresponds to a true homoclinic orbit. This work also presents the first examples of computer-assisted proofs of gap solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on non-perturbative parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Mass inflation from rough initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the strong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak, formulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric charged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near extremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely, when non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves propagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned family, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at the Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the possible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In line with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an instability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass inflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing the interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1) initial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to $W^{1, 2}\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q &gt; 2$, along the initial ingoing compact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the black hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference black hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth data suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a ``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected Price law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and rough initial data.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski problem for $\alpha$-concave functions via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notions of the Euclidean surface area measure and the spherical surface area measure of $\alpha$-concave functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $-\frac{1}{n}&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, are introduced via a first variation of the total mass functional with respect to the $\alpha$-sum operation. Subsequently, these notions are extended to those for $\alpha$-concave measures. We then study the Minkowski problem associated with the Euclidean surface area measures of $\alpha$-concave measures via optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of curl eigenfields solving Woltjer's variational problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rotationally symmetric toroidal domains in $\mathbb R^3$ for which the eigenfields associated to the first (positive) Amp\`erian curl eigenvalue are symmetric, and others for which no first eigenfield is symmetric. This implies, in particular, that minimizers of the celebrated Woltjer's variational principle do not need to inherit the rotational symmetry of the domain. This disproves the folk wisdom that the eigenfields corresponding to the lowest curl eigenvalue must be symmetric if the domain is.</description>
