      <title>A new approach for deducing rms proton radii from charge-changing reactions of neutron-rich nuclei and the reaction-target dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the charge-changing cross sections ($\sigma_{\text{cc}}$) of 24 $p$-shell nuclides on both hydrogen and carbon at about 900$A$ MeV, of which $^{8,9}$Li, $^{10\textendash12}$Be, $^{10,14,15}$B, $^{14,15,17\textendash22}$N and $^{16}$O on hydrogen and $^{8,9}$Li on carbon are for the first time. Benefiting from the data set,we found a new and robust relationship between the scaling factor of the Glauber model calculations and the separation energies of the nuclei of interest on both targets.This allows us to deduce proton radii ($R_p$) for the first time from the cross sections on hydrogen. Nearly identical $R_p$ values are deduced from both target data for the neutron-rich carbon isotopes, however, the $R_p$ from the hydrogen target is systematically smaller in the neutron-rich nitrogen isotopes.This calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Energy, strength, and alpha width measurements of $E_{\rm{c.m.}} = 1323$ and $1487$ keV resonances in $^{15}$N($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{19}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{15}$N($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{19}$F reaction produces $^{19}$F in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, where the low energy tails of two resonances at $E_{\rm{c.m.}} = 1323 \pm 2$ and $1487 \pm 1.7$ keV are estimated to contribute about $30\%$ of the total reaction rate in these environments. However, recent measurements have shown discrepancies in the energies, the strengths, and the corresponding alpha widths of these two resonances, resulting in an increase in the systematic uncertainty of the extrapolated cross section to helium burning energies. With this motivation, we have undertaken new measurements of the $^{15}$N$(\alpha,\gamma)^{19}$F at the University of Notre Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory. The setup consisted of an alpha particle beam impinged on a solid Ti$^{15}$N target with gamma-ray spectroscopy accomplished using a high purity germanium detector. Using the Doppler corrected gamma-ray energies, we confirmed the lower resonance energy to be $1321.6 \pm 0.6$ keV and found a value for the higher one of $1479.4 \pm 0.6$ keV that is more consistent with those found from previous elastic scattering studies. We found that the resonance strengths for both were consistent with most values found in the literature, but a larger alpha width has been recommended for the $E_{\rm{c.m.}} = 1487$ keV resonance. The larger alpha width suggests a reaction rate increase of about $15\%$ at temperatures $T &lt; 0.1$ GK relevant to low mass AGB stars. The impact of the increased reaction rate requires further investigations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale physics of atomic nuclei from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding is approached near the neutron- and proton driplines, traditional shell-structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here we achieve this within a unified and non-perturbative framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range correlations which accounts for the bulk of the binding energy is included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included via symmetry projection. Our calculations accurately reproduce available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in $^{20-30}$Ne. We also reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in $^{30}$Ne, which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number $N=20$ as the key nucleus $^{28}$O is approached, and we predict that the dripline nuclei $^{32,34}$Ne are strongly deformed. By developing reduced-order-models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S-wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective-field-theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quark in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic bases with hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which controls the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of pairs of anti-charm/charm quarks through the rotation of Feynman diagrams using cross symmetry for elastic scattering of charm quark with thermal partons ((anti-)quarks or gluons) in the sQGP by the exchange of the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Comparing with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <title>CRES-Based Non-destructive Electron Momentum Estimation for the PTOLEMY Relic Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The novel electron spectrometry method proposed by the PTOLEMY relic neutrino experiment requires a real-time, non-destructive estimate of the parallel and transverse momentum splits of tritium $\beta$-decay electrons. We propose to obtain this estimate using cyclotron-radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES), in which the kinetic energy of a charged particle is determined by measuring the relativistic frequency shift of the cyclotron radiation emitted by the particle in a magnetic field. This paper presents the first design for a configuration that can be feasibly integrated directly into the existing design for the transverse drift filter proposed by the PTOLEMY collaboration. We propose a geometry incorporating a cavity resonator to enhance a ${\sim}\mathcal{O}(1) \hspace{1mm}\mathrm{fW}$ cyclotron radiation signal and derive key features of the expected observed radiation specific to our RF tracking configuration. We estimate the performance of our design using electromagnetic simulations and present a general signal reconstruction algorithm capable of matching an observed signal to electron kinematic parameters. The projected SNR of this technique demonstrates for the first time that a non-destructive RF tracking system is applicable for the suppression of backgrounds in a differential energy measurement of tritium endpoint electrons.</description>

      <title>Farside-dominant quasinuclear rainbow in refractive $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering has a long history since the first experiment by Rutherford and Chadwick in 1927 and has been studied thoroughly experimentally and theoretically. However, $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering has never been paid attention from the viewpoint of refractive scattering. I have successfully analyzed the experimental angular distributions in $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering systematically over a wide range of incident energies $E_L$=53.4 - 280 MeV using a phenomenological optical model with a deep real potential. The existence of a farside-dominant quasinuclear rainbow with no well-defined rainbow angle and no supernumerary bow in the lit side followed by the shadow, which is not a genuine rainbow but a refractive scattering from a marginally small droplet at high energies, is found for the first time in $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering. The refraction due to the deep potentials with an attractive core at short distances are discussed from the viewpoint of the Luneburg. The deep vs shallow problem of the potential and the nuclear rainbow scattering in inelastic channels are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The LHC as a Neutrino-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate a high-intensity collimated beam of neutrinos in the forward (beam) direction, characterised by energies of up to several TeV. The recent observation of LHC neutrinos by FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC signals that this hitherto ignored particle beam is now available for scientific inquiry. Here we quantify the impact that neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC would have on the parton distributions (PDFs) of protons and heavy nuclei. We generate projections for DIS structure functions for FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at Run III, as well as for the FASER$\nu$2, AdvSND, and FLArE experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating concurrently with the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). We determine that up to one million electron- and muon-neutrino DIS interactions within detector acceptance can be expected by the end of the HL-LHC, covering a kinematic region in $x$ and $Q^2$ overlapping with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. Including these DIS projections into global (n)PDF analyses, specifically PDF4LHC21, NNPDF4.0, and EPPS21, reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, in particular for strangeness and the up and down valence PDFs. We show that LHC neutrino data enables improved theoretical predictions for core processes at the HL-LHC, such as Higgs and weak gauge boson production. Our analysis demonstrates that exploiting the LHC neutrino beam effectively provides CERN with a "Neutrino-Ion Collider" without requiring modifications in its accelerator infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Low-energy structure and $\beta$ decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei in the region of a shape phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy structure and $\beta$ decay properties of the neutron-rich even-mass nuclei near the neutron number $N=60$ that are experimentally of much interest are investigated within the framework of the nuclear density functional theory and the interacting boson-fermion-fermion model. By using the results of the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the relativistic energy density functional, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing the even-even core nuclei, the boson-fermion, and the fermion-fermion interactions are determined. The Gamow-Teller transition strengths, with the corresponding operator being constructed without introducing further phenomenological adjustment, are computed by using the wave functions of the initial and final nuclei of the $\beta$ decay. The triaxial quadrupole potential energy surfaces computed for the $N=60$ even-even isotones suggest a pronounced $\gamma$ softness. The calculated energy spectra for the even-even and odd-odd nuclei in the Rb to Cd isotopic chains exhibit an abrupt change in nuclear structure around $N=60$, as suggested experimentally. The predicted $\beta$-decay $\log{}_{10}ft$ values underestimate the measured values for the nuclei with low $Z$ and with $N \leqslant 60$, exhibit a rapid increase for $N&gt;60$, reflecting the nuclear structure evolution, and agree rather well with the measured values for those nuclei with $Z$ being not far from the proton major shell closure $Z=50$. Sensitivity of the predicted $\beta$-decay properties to the model assumptions and parameters employed in the nuclear structure calculations is discussed, specifically, by comparing results obtained based on the different choices of the underlying energy density functional.</description>

      <title>Updated numerical study of transverse single-spin asymmetries in single-inclusive pion production from lepton-nucleon collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the analysis of transverse single-spin asymmetries $A_N$ in lepton-nucleon scattering where only a single pion is detected in the final state, $\ell\,N^\uparrow\to h\, X$. This observable is the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) analogue to $A_N$ in proton-proton collisions, $p^\uparrow p\to h\,X$, that has been studied intensely for decades, especially at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We incorporate new theoretical developments in the collinear twist-3 framework and utilize recent extractions of (Sivers-like and Collins-like) quark-gluon-quark correlators in the numerical computations. We compare our calculations to HERMES measurements as well as make predictions for Jefferson Lab, COMPASS, and EIC kinematics. We further explore the role of next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the (twist-2) unpolarized cross section (denominator of $A_N$) and consider what can be deduced empirically about the potential numerical significance of the full NLO calculation of $A_N$ in this process. We consider sources of theoretical uncertainty in our predictions, which present potential opportunities then for future measurements to improve our understanding of $A_N$ and multi-parton correlations in hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have examined the hypothesis by Bijker and Iachello who asserted that 12C has an internal structure with three alpha particles arranged in a triangular shape, leading to the formation of the ground rotational band consisting of 0+, 2+, 3-, 4$^\pm$ and 5- states. Following this idea, we reconstructed the intrinsic shape of 12C using experimental electron scattering data with minimal theoretical assumption. Our sole assumption was that the observed 0+, 2+, 3-, and 4+ states share a common internal structure, forming a rotational spectrum. The reconstructed intrinsic density showed a beautiful triangular shape with three peaks implying alpha cluster formation in the ground band.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&amp;D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.</description>
