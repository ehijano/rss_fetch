      <title>Variation of algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a canonical algebraically integrable foliation on a klt projective variety, we study the variation of the ample models of the associated adjoint foliated structures with respect to the parameter. When the foliation is of general type, we show the finiteness of ample models if the parameter is sufficiently close to $1$. When the ambient variety is of general type, we show the finiteness of ample models for all parameters. A key ingredient in our proof is the equivalence between the existence of minimal models and the termination of MMP with scaling for algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures.</description>

      <title>Tjurina Number Jumps and Unimodal Hypersurface Singularities in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02619v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes existing methods to derive stronger bounds on the modality of hypersurface singularities. Our results demonstrate that each sudden jump in the Tjurina number necessarily increases the modality. Furthermore, we provide a full classification of unimodal isolated hypersurface singularities in characteristic p &gt; 3 under contact equivalence. Keywords. isolated singularity, classification, modality, positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present combinatorial/geometric obstructions induced by the factorization over the integers of the Chern polynomial of the bundle of logarithmic vector fields associated to a complex projective plane curve. Our results generalize at the same time similar results on projective lines arrangements whose characteristic polynomial factors over the integers and results on free curves. We give a splitting criterion for a rank 2 vector bundle, in terms of restrictions to smooth conics.</description>

      <title>Formal smoothness of the Artin-Mazur formal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth proper variety over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. We find cohomological conditions for the Artin-Mazur formal group functors $\Phi^{i}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ to be formally smooth. We show that if all crystalline cohomology groups of $X$ are torsion-free (e.g. if $X$ is an abelian variety) then all of the $\Phi^{i}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ are representable and formally smooth. We then identify a necessary condition for formal smoothness, which we use to give examples, for any $d\ge2$, of varieties $X$ for which $\Phi^{i}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is formally smooth when $i&lt;d$, whereas $\Phi^{d}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is not. The constructions are inspired by Igusa's surface with non-smooth Picard scheme. Finally, we give a condition equivalent to formal smoothness in terms of Serre's Witt vector cohomology. The strategy relies on the notion of $C$-smoothness - where $C$ is the group algebra of $\mathbb{Q}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p$ - which is a condition that detects when a formal group is formally smooth, and on the use of the Nygaard filtration to relate fppf cohomology to crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate mixed maps and contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of real analytic maps $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^k$, where $n &gt; k$, regarded as mixed maps, defined below. Firstly, we give two natural families of mixed isolated complete intersection singularities, called mixed ICIS, which are interesting on their own. We consider the notion of (partial) non-degeneracy for mixed maps; we prove that these define mixed ICIS and that, under suitable conditions, admit a local Milnor fibration. Then, building on previous constructions due to Oka, we obtain natural contact structures and adapted open books on a particular class of mixed links. Finally, we look at mixed links that are diffeomorphic to holomorphic ones, and we address the problem of comparing different contact structures.</description>

      <title>Very ample sheaves on weighted projective spaces and weighted blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider graded rings $R$ generated by $n$ homogeneous elements of positive integer degrees $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ that have least common multiple $d$. We show that for every integer $k \geq \max(1, n-2)$, the $kd$th Veronese subring $R^{(kd)}$ is generated in degree 1, which implies that the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(kd)$ is very ample on the scheme $\operatorname{Proj}(R)$. This statement is sharp for every $n \geq 4$. We show that if all the weights $w_i$ are less than 15, then $R^{(d)}$ is generated in degree 1. This bound is sharp for all $n \geq 4$. We prove that if the weights are pairwise coprime, then $R^{(d)}$ is always generated in degree 1. We show that for almost all of the vectors $(w_1, \ldots, w_n)$, $R^{(d)}$ is generated in degree 1. Finally, we show that there exist 14 fundamental vectors such that if all the weights are less than 42 and $R^{(d)}$ is not generated in degree 1, then up to permutation, a subsequence of $(w_1, \ldots, w_n)$ is equal to a fundamental vector. We prove similar statements for Rees rings and the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(kd)$ on the weighted blowup of the affine $n$-space with weights $(w_1, \ldots, w_n)$, with the inequality $k \geq \max(1, n-2)$ replaced by $k \geq \max(1, n-1)$.</description>

      <title>On Nearly Frobenius Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly Frobenius structures and 2-dimensional Almost TQFTs were introduced and shown to be in categorical equivalence in arXiv:1907.05470 in the attempt to extend the Atiyah-Segal's definition to the category of infinite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we investigate nearly Frobenius structures and we give a classification result for Almost TQFTs in dimension 2. In particular, the TQFTs functorial axioms become equivalent to the Edge Contraction/Construction axioms of colored ribbon graphs recently introduced by the authors.</description>

      <title>Antiampleness and ampleness of the Frobenius cokernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano variety containing a line or a conic with respect to $-K_X$, then the Frobenius cokernel $\mathcal B_X:=\mathrm{coker}(\mathcal O_X\to F_* \mathcal O_X)$ is not antiample; using this criteria, we show that the only smooth Fano threefolds with antiample Frobenius cokernel are $\mathbb P^3$ and the quadric threefold (in characteristic $p\neq 2$), thus answering a question raised by Carvajal-Rojas and Patakfalvi. We also show that for any smooth complete intersection $X\subset \mathbb P^n$ of degree $d_1,\dots,d_c$ such that $\sum d_i = n$ or $n-1$, the Frobenius cokernel is not antiample. We also study the kernels of the higher Cartier operators, and show that for $\mathbb P^n$ and quadric hypersurfaces, all the kernels of the higher Cartier operators are antiample, and thus that the full set of kernels of the Cartier operators cannot characterize projective space. Finally, we show that the Frobenius cokernel is ample if and only if the cotangent bundle is ample.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping as a Morphism: An Arithmetic Geometry Approach to Asymptotically Faster Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a powerful paradigm for secure computation, but its practical adoption is severely hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of its bootstrapping procedure. The complexity of all current bootstrapping methods is fundamentally tied to the multiplicative depth of the decryption circuit, denoted $L_{dec}$, making it the primary performance bottleneck. This paper introduces a new approach to bootstrapping that completely bypasses the traditional circuit evaluation model. We apply the tools of modern arithmetic geometry to reframe the bootstrapping operation as a direct geometric projection. Our framework models the space of ciphertexts as an affine scheme and rigorously defines the loci of decryptable and fresh ciphertexts as distinct closed subschemes. The bootstrapping transformation is then realized as a morphism between these two spaces. Computationally, this projection is equivalent to solving a specific Closest Vector Problem (CVP) instance on a highly structured ideal lattice, which we show can be done efficiently using a technique we call algebraic folding. The primary result of our work is a complete and provably correct bootstrapping algorithm with a computational complexity of $O(d \cdot \text{poly}(\log q))$, where $d$ is the ring dimension and $q$ is the ciphertext modulus. The significance of this result lies in the complete elimination of the factor $L_{dec}$ from the complexity, representing a fundamental asymptotic improvement over the state of the art. This geometric perspective offers a new and promising pathway toward achieving truly practical and high-performance FHE.</description>

      <title>K-Points and Type IIB/Heterotic Duality with NS5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit type II$_0$ limits in the vector multiplet moduli space of compactifications of Type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. These limits are special because they cannot be described using mirror symmetry. While we showed in previous work that the gravitational duality frame emerging in such limits corresponds to a weakly coupled heterotic string compactified on K3 times a string-sized torus, our focus here is on the additional field theory sectors that decouple from gravity in these asymptotic regimes. Concretely, we argue that, in the dual heterotic description, these field theory sectors correspond to spacetime-filling NS5-branes wrapping the heterotic torus. The existence of such non-perturbative field theory sectors manifests itself in an exponential dependence of the prepotential on the heterotic dilaton at leading order. Applied to K-point limits in one-parameter moduli spaces, our results imply that these limits are in perfect agreement with the Distance and Emergent String Conjectures. More precisely, the light tower of states predicted by the Distance Conjecture arises from excitations of a weakly coupled heterotic string compactified to four dimensions on a background containing spacetime-filling NS5-branes.</description>

      <title>Slant sums of quiver gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of slant sum of quiver gauge theories, a type of surgery on the underlying quiver. Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed points on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver varieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions before and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule" for vertex functions.
  Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the factorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The branching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special cases, it also provides a formula for the $\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex functions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over reverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture, such expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma modules on the 3d mirror dual side.
  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what can be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums of Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional framing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking products.</description>

      <title>On the pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks of Drinfeld spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}$ denote the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld space over a $p$-adic field $K$. We give an explicit description of the $\ell$-adic and $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}_K)]$ and $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(K)]$, which are moduli stacks of special formal $\mathcal{O}_D$-modules. The computation makes use of the isomorphism between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze--Weinstein, as well as the $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of the Drinfeld spaces computed by Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol. As an application, we also compute the continuous group cohomology of $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ over duals of generalized Steinberg representations over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Computing the number of realisations of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02988v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is said to be rigid if, given a generic realisation of the graph as a bar-and-joint framework in the plane, there exist only finitely many other realisations of the graph with the same edge lengths modulo rotations, reflections and translations. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in determining exactly what this finite amount is, hereon known as the realisation number. Combinatorial algorithms for the realisation number were previously known for the special cases of minimally rigid and redundantly rigid graphs. In this paper we provide a combinatorial algorithm to compute the realisation number of any rigid graph, and thus solve an open problem of Jackson and Owen. We then adapt our algorithm to compute: (i) spherical realisation numbers, and (ii) the number of rank-3 PSD matrix completions of a generic partial matrix.</description>

      <title>Two Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss two closely related Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds. The first is a Calabi-Yau theorem for big test configurations, that generalizes a result in [WN24]. It follows from recent joint work with Mesquita-Piccione [MW25], but is here given a more direct proof. The second result is a Calabi-Yau theorem for a wider class of degenerations, formulated in the language of non-Archimedean K\"ahler geometry. It was first proved in the algebraic setting by Boucksom-Jonsson [BJ22], building on earlier work of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson [BFJ15], while the general K\"ahler case was established in [MW25]. Our main focus here is on the connection between these results and the theory of big cohomology classes and their volumes.</description>

      <title>Notions of Higher Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notions of finite type play an important role in several complex variables. The most standard notion is D'Angelo type, which measures the order of contact of holomorphic curves with the boundary of a domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$. For the $\bar \partial$-Neumann problem, however, the order of contact of the boundary of the domain with $q$-dimensional complex varieties controls its behavior on $(p,q)$ forms. There are two different ways of measuring this order of contact, one due to John D'Angelo and another due to David Catlin. We survey the known results about the D'Angelo and Catlin $q$-types, their relationship, and other notions that complete the picture.</description>

      <title>Many rays of the submodular cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the cone of submodular functions goes back to Jack Edmonds' seminal 1970 paper, which already highlighted the difficulty of characterizing its extreme rays. Since then, researchers from diverse fields have sought to characterize, enumerate, and bound the number of such rays. In this paper, we introduce an inductive construction that generates new rays of the submodular cone. This allows us to establish that the $n$-th submodular cone has at least $2^{2^{n-2}}$ rays, which improves upon the lower bound obtained from Hien Q. Nguyen's 1986 characterization of indecomposable matroid polytopes by a factor of order $\sqrt{n^3}$ in the exponent.</description>

      <title>Gravity prop and moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ be the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus $g$ with $m+n$ marked points decomposed into the disjoint union of two sets of cardinalities $m$ and $n$, and $H_c^{\bullet}(\mathcal{M}_{m+n})$ its compactly supported cohomology group. We prove that the collection of $S$-bimodules $\left\{H_c^{\bullet-m}(\mathcal{M}_{g,m+n})\right\}$ has the structure of a properad (called the gravity properad) such that it contains the (degree shifted) E. Getzler's gravity operad as the sub-collection $\{H_c^{\bullet-1}(\mathcal{M}_{0,1+n})\}_{n\geq 2}$. Moreover, we prove that the generators of the 1-dimensional cohomology groups $H_c^{\bullet-1}(\mathcal{M}_{0,1+2})$, $H_c^{\bullet-2}(\mathcal{M}_{0,2+1})$ and $H_c^{\bullet-3}(\mathcal{M}_{0,3+0})$ satisfy with respect to this properadic structure the relations of the (degree shifted) quasi-Lie bialgebra, a fact making the totality of cohomology groups $ \prod_{g,m,n} H_c^{\bullet}(\mathcal{M}_{g,m+n})\otimes_{S_m^{op}\times S_n} (sgn_m\otimes Id_n)$ into a complex with the differential fully determined by the just mentioned three cohomology classes . It is proven that this complex contains infinitely many cohomology classes, all coming from M. Kontsevich's odd graph complex.
  The gravity prop structure is established with the help of T. Willwacher's twisting endofunctor (in the category of properads under the operad of Lie algebras) and K. Costello's theory of moduli spaces of nodal disks with marked boundaries and internal marked points (such that each disk contains at most one internal marked point).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First we refine the duality theory for Witt divisorial sheaves on smooth projective varieties over a perfect field of positive characteristic. Building on previous work [Lem22], we remove the residual derived limit to obtain a cleaner isomorphism. As an application, we prove a Ramanujam-type vanishing theorem for Witt divisorial sheaves of nef and big divisors on surfaces. Finally, we show that a surface constructed by Langer [Lan16] with a divisor constructed by Cascini and Tanaka [CT18] gives a counterexample to Kawamata-Viehweg-type vanishing of Witt divisorial sheaves in dimension two.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p$. It is a natural question whether the Frobenius pushforwards $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ of the structure sheaf are tilting bundles. We show if $X$ is a smooth del Pezzo surface of degree $\leq 3$ or a Fano threefold with $\mathrm{vol}(K_X)&lt;24$ over a field of characteristic $p$, then $\mathrm{Ext}^i(F_*^e\mathcal O_X,F^e_*\mathcal O_X)\neq 0$ and thus $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ is not tilting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic algebraic geometry uses homotopy type theory extended with three axioms to develop algebraic geometry internal to a higher version of the Zariski topos. In this article we make no essential use of the higher structure and use homotopy type theory only for convenience. We define \'etale, smooth and unramified maps between schemes in synthetic algebraic geometry using a new synthetic definition. We give the usual characterizations of these classes of maps in terms of injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity of differentials. We also show that the tangent spaces of smooth schemes are finite free modules. Finally, we show that unramified, \'etale and smooth schemes can be understood very concretely via the expected local algebraic description.</description>

Abstract: We compare strongly recursive tropical linear series as defined by Farkas, Jensen, and Payne with combinatorial limit linear series as defined by Amini and Gierczak. We show that strongly recursive tropical linear series of rank $r$ are combinatorial limit linear series of rank $r$ and construct a counterexample to the converse. We also present several extensions of our main result, including a simplification of the definition of combinatorial limit linear series and an investigation of their relationship with tropical linear series in the sense of Chang et al. Finally, we address the realizability of permutation arrays as local arrays of linear series on tropical curves. Finally, discuss the realizability of permutation arrays as local arrays of linear series on tropical curves.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the possible ways of gluing twisted products of circles with asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds to produce manifolds with holonomy G_2, thus generalising the twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev and Corti, Haskins, Nordstr\"om, Pacini. We then express the extended nu-invariant of Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om arXiv:1505.02734 in terms of fixpoint and gluing contributions, which include different types of (generalised) Dedekind sums. Surprisingly, the calculations involve some non-trivial number-theoretical arguments connected with special values of the Dedekind eta-function and the theory of complex multiplication. One consequence of our computations is that there exist compact G_2-manifolds that are not G_2-nullbordant.</description>

      <title>Pseudolimits for Tangent Categories with Applications to Equivariant Algebraic and Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if $\mathscr{C}$ is a category and if $F\colon\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ is a pseudofunctor such that for each object $X$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the category $F(X)$ is a tangent category and for each morphism $f$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the functor $F(f)$ is part of a strong tangent morphism $(F(f),{}_{f}{\alpha})$ and that furthermore the natural transformations ${}_{f}{\alpha}$ vary pseudonaturally in $\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}}$, then there is a tangent structure on the pseudolimit $\mathbf{PC}(F)$ which is induced by the tangent structures on the categories $F(X)$ together with how they vary through the functors $F(f)$. We use this observation to show that the forgetful $2$-functor $\operatorname{Forget}:\mathfrak{Tan} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ creates and preserves pseudolimits indexed by $1$-categories. As an application, this allows us to describe how equivariant descent interacts with the tangent structures on the category of smooth (real) manifolds and on various categories of (algebraic) varieties over a field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Questions related to Brauer-Manin obstructions to the Hasse principle and weak approximation for homogeneous spaces of tori over a number field are well-studied, generally using arithmetic duality theorems, starting with works of Sansuc and of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. In this article, we prove the analogous statements (and include obstructions to strong approximation over finite places) in the general case of a commutative affine group scheme $G$ of finite type over a global field in any characteristic. We also study finiteness of different variants of the second Tate-Shafarevich kernel (such as $S$-kernels and $\omega$-kernels) of the Cartier dual of $G$. All this is made possible by some recent theoretical advancements in positive characteristic, namely the finiteness theorems of B. Conrad and the generalized Tate duality of Z. Rosengarten.</description>

Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Tannakian formalism to define the Emerton--Gee stack for general groups. For a flat algebraic group G over Z_p, we are able to prove the associated Emerton--Gee stack is a formal algebraic stack locally of finite presentation over Spf(Z_p). We also define a derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure on the absolute prismatic site, whose underlying classical stack is proved to be equivalent to the Emerton--Gee stack.
  In the case of connected reductive groups, we show that the derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure is classical in the sense that when restricted to truncated animated rings, it is the \'etale sheafification of the left Kan extension of the Emerton--Gee stack along the inclusion from classical commutative rings to animated rings. Moreover, when G is a generalised reductive group, the classicality result still holds for a modified version of the Emerton--Gee stack. In particular, this completes the picture that the derived stack of local Langlands parameters for the Langlands dual group of a reductive group is classical.</description>

Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a non-Archimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Representing Positive Semi-Definite Polynomials as Sums of Squares with Rational Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for constructing a sum-of-squares (SOS) decomposition for positive semi-definite polynomials with rational coefficients. Unlike previous methods that typically yield SOS decompositions with floating-point coefficients, our approach ensures that all coefficients in the decomposition remain rational. This is particularly useful in formal verification and symbolic computation, where exact arithmetic is required. We introduce a stepwise reduction technique that transforms a given polynomial into a sum of ladder-like squares while preserving rationality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing numerical approaches.
