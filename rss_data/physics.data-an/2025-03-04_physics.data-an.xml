      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pre-train the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set, and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode (FCC-ee). We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics; including jet resolution and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large physics models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping accelerate the development cycle for new detectors, and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Heron: Visualizing and Controlling Chemical Reaction Explorations and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Impact of Redshift Space Distortion on Persistent Homology of cosmic matter density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing summary statistics obtained from Persistent Homology (PH), we investigate the influence of Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) on the topology of excursion sets formed through the super-level filtration method applied to three-dimensional matter density fields. The synthetic fields simulated by the Quijote suite in both real and redshift spaces are smoothed by accounting for the Gaussian smoothing function with different scales. The RSD leads a tendency for clusters ($\tilde{\beta}_0$) to shift towards higher thresholds, while filament loops ($\tilde{\beta}_1$) and cosmic voids ($\tilde{\beta}_2$) migrate towards lower thresholds. Notably, $\tilde{\beta}_2$ exhibits greater sensitivity to RSD compared to clusters and independent loops. As the smoothing scales increase, the amplitude of the reduced Betti number curve ($\tilde{\beta}_k$) decreases, and the corresponding peak position shifts towards the mean threshold. Conversely, the amplitude of $\tilde{\beta}_k$ remains almost unchanged with variations in redshift for $z\in[0-3]$. The analysis of persistent entropy and the overall abundance of $k$-holes indicates that the linear Kaiser effect plays a significant role compared to the non-linear effect for $R \gtrsim 30$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$, whereas persistent entropy proves to be a reliable measure against non-linear influences.</description>

      <title>Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>SymbolFit: Automatic Parametric Modeling with Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SymbolFit, a framework that automates parametric modeling by using symbolic regression to perform a machine-search for functions that fit the data while simultaneously providing uncertainty estimates in a single run. Traditionally, constructing a parametric model to accurately describe binned data has been a manual and iterative process, requiring an adequate functional form to be determined before the fit can be performed. The main challenge arises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first principles, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function for the distribution. In this work, we develop a framework that automates and streamlines the process by utilizing symbolic regression, a machine learning technique that explores a vast space of candidate functions without requiring a predefined functional form because the functional form itself is treated as a trainable parameter, making the process far more efficient and effortless than traditional regression methods. We demonstrate the framework in high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using five real proton-proton collision datasets from new physics searches, including background modeling in resonance searches for high-mass dijet, trijet, paired-dijet, diphoton, and dimuon events. We show that our framework can flexibly and efficiently generate a wide range of candidate functions that fit a nontrivial distribution well using a simple fit configuration that varies only by random seed, and that the same fit configuration, which defines a vast function space, can also be applied to distributions of different shapes, whereas achieving a comparable result with traditional methods would have required extensive manual effort.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of states through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - in a state space which forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated state. The so-called group-affine property of the state evolution is shown to be necessary and sufficient for linearity of the dynamics on the associated Lie algebra, in turn implying CGs are invariant under such evolution. A putative SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, numerical experiments demonstrate that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>
