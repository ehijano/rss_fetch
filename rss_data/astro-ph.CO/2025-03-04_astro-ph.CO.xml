      <title>TDCOSMO: XX. WFI2033--4723, the First Quadruply-Imaged Quasar Modeled with JWST Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the primordial power spectrum using a differentiable likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest inflationary models predict the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature perturbations to be nearly scale-invariant. However, various other models of inflation predict deviations from this behaviour, motivating a data-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this work, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to reconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators for fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging gradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our approach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of cosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on both. Applying this framework to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data we find our reconstructed PPS to be consistent with near scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at large scales, driven mostly by cosmic variance. Our results show an overestimation of the PPS amplitude compared to $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the Planck 2018 analysis, which we attribute to our choice of a conservative prior on the optical depth $\tau$ based on Planck 2015 measurements. Adopting a prior consistent with Planck 2018 measurements brings our results into full agreement with previous work. To ensure robustness of our results, we validate our differentiable pipeline against a non-differentiable framework, and also demonstrate that our results are insensitive to the choice of Gaussian process hyperparameters. These promising results and the flexibility of our pipeline make it ideally suited for application to additional data sets such as CMB polarisation as well as Large-Scale Structure probes, thus moving towards multi-probe primordial power spectrum reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Dynamical Dark Energy on the Neutrino Mass Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference between the total neutrino mass estimates ($\sum m_\nu$) derived from cosmological data within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and those obtained from terrestrial particle physics experiments underscores the need to explore alternative scenarios. Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$, thus alleviating this tension. This study investigates the robustness of this discrepancy by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how other EoS parameterizations, such as the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) parameterizations, affect $\sum m_\nu$ estimates. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis combining the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, which includes information on temperature, polarization, and lensing, as well as the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae observations. While both the BA and JBP parameterizations can also resolve the tension, our results show a correlation between the dark energy EoS and the constraints on neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift ($z\simeq 7-15$). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both $z\sim 1$ from large-scale structure and $z\sim 1000$ from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes: A New Possibility for Observing Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the Hawking radiation they produce represents a significant step toward understanding the role of these phenomena in the cosmological evolution of the Universe. PBHs could be a component of dark matter, the seeds of supermassive black holes, and sources of Hawking radiation, which, unlike the radiation from other black holes, might be observable. Over the course of the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day, PBHs have lost a substantial portion of their mass through neutrino radiation. This occurs because, for black holes with masses $M\lesssim10^{23}\,$g, the radiation of the lightest massive particles - neutrinos - becomes significant alongside the emission of photons. This neutrino radiation eventually dominates the emission process. By the present time ($t_0=13.8$ Gyr), only black holes with masses $\lesssim 10^{15}\,$g have largely evaporated, meaning that the total emission spectrum of PBHs is now dominated by the neutrino component. In this paper, we present new estimates of the neutrino spectra emitted by PBHs of various masses, with a particular focus on low-energy radiation ($E_{kin} \in [0.01 \div 1]\, $eV) for the first time. Our calculations demonstrate that black holes in the mass range $[10^{9}\div10^{11}]\,$g emit neutrinos with intensities that exceed the background fluxes from known astrophysical sources in the low-energy range. In contrast, in the high-energy range, the emission remains below the background level, consistent with observational constraints. These findings open new avenues for the potential detection of PBH radiation and could stimulate advancements in neutrino detection technologies, particularly in the low-energy regime. The observation of neutrinos in this energy range represents one of the few opportunities to confirm the existence of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed for analyzing the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in the detection of CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>The J-PAS survey: The effect of photometric redshift errors on cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of photometric redshift errors in the ongoing Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) on void identification and properties using a watershed-based method, aiming to assess the recovery of individual voids and the overall void environment. We created galaxy mock catalogues for redshift z = 0.1 using the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation, defining two datasets: an $ideal$ sample ($m_r &lt; 21$ mag) and a $perturbed$ sample with the Z-coordinate errors mimicking J-PAS's line-of-sight errors, derived from the precursor miniJPAS survey data. We identified voids using ZOBOV, a watershed algorithm. We found 1065 voids in the $ideal$ sample and 2558 voids in the $perturbed$ sample. The $perturbed$ sample voids have, on average, smaller sizes and denser interiors. We filtered out voids based on density and radius in order to eliminate overdense and small spurious instances. The stacked density profile of filtered voids in the $perturbed$ sample remains close to the average density even at the boundary peak, indicating a strong blurring of structures by the redshift errors. The number of $ideal$ sample voids for which at least $50\%$ of the volume is recovered by a void in the $perturbed$ sample is 53 (29 for the filtered sample). The volume occupied by these voids is less than $10\%$ of the simulation volume. Merging voids in the $perturbed$ sample marginally improves the recovery. The overall volumes defined as voids in the two samples have an overlap of $80\%$, making up $61\%$ of the simulation box volume. While some statistical properties of voids might be recovered sufficiently well, the watershed algorithms may not be optimal for recovering the large-scale structure voids if applied straight to photometric redshift survey data.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the HI 21-cm cosmology maps through Largest Cluster Statistics. Part II. Impact of the realistic foreground and instrumental noise on synthetic SKA1-Low observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Largest Cluster Statistics\,(LCS) analysis of the redshifted 21\,cm maps has been demonstrated to be an efficient and robust method for following the time evolution of the largest ionized regions\,(LIRs) during the Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\,(\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\,cm maps in the presence of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $1500$\,hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.05\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the inflaton potential from scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plateau on the background inflaton potential $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ can lead cosmic inflation into an ultraslow-roll phase, greatly enhancing the primordial power spectrum on small scales, and resulting in significant scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) and abundant primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work, we construct an anti-symmetric perturbation $\delta V(\phi)$ on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ with three model parameters, the position, width, and slope of $\delta V(\phi)$, and constrain these parameters from the potential stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in NANOGrav 15-year data set. The GW spectrum from the merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with two model parameters, the amplitude and spectral index, is also investigated for comparison. We perform Bayesian analysis in three steps with increasing number of model parameters, and obtain the allowed parameter ranges. When the constraints on PBH abundance are taken into account, these ranges become further narrower. We find that the increase of model parameters cannot significantly improve the Bayes factors, and the model with an almost perfect plateau on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ is favored. Moreover, the interpretation of the SGWB via only the GWs generated by SMBHBs is not preferred by the data.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and scalar induced gravitational waves from sound speed resonance in derivatively coupling inflation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amplification of primordial curvature perturbations through a sound speed resonance mechanism within an inflationary model featuring a non-minimal derivative coupling. In this scenario, the coupling function is composed of a constant term and a periodic term. Our analysis demonstrates that the periodic behavior of the squared sound speed transforms the curvature perturbation equation into a Mathieu equation on sub-horizon scales. This resonance effect leads to a substantial enhancement of curvature perturbations, which, upon re-entering the Hubble horizon during the radiation-dominated era, can trigger the formation of primordial black holes, potentially contributing to the dark matter density. Additionally, the amplified perturbations generate scalar-induced gravitational waves with amplitudes that may lie within the detectable range of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a testable observational signature of the model.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Quantifying the impact of beam chromaticity on large-scale B-mode science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) will observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization at six frequency bands. Within these bands, the angular response of the telescope (beam) is convolved with the instrument's spectral response (commonly called bandpass) and the signal from the sky, which leads to the band-averaged telescope beam response, which is sampled and digitized. The spectral properties of the band-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band, referred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the interplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various components that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric power-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower, to which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the beamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We find a small, $0.02\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems to mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \sigma$ bias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian foreground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller than $1\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model. This includes the case where we introduce additional uncertainty on the bandpass shape, which accounts for approximately half of the total allowed gain uncertainty, as estimated in previous work for the SO SATs.</description>

      <title>Gauge-dependence of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review we look into the gauge-dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are second-order tensors produced by first-order scalar-modes. The method includes deriving the background, first- and second-order Einstein field equations without imposing a gauge. We address the gauge-invariant approach and study the source-term of SIGWs in three different gauges, synchronous, Poisson and uniform curvature gauge. We find that numerically computed kernels in all three gauges behave closely with minimal discrepancy. As expected, when going in sub-horizon modes, $x\gg1$, the discrepancy decreases and the behavior matches, pointing to a gauge-invariant observable.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for Dark Energy Including Particle Creation or Destruction Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic analyses of dark energy as a relativistic fluid indicates that this intriguing component of the universe mimics a bulk viscous pressure when the parameter of its barotropic equation of state varies with time. Since in cosmology bulk viscosity and creation or destruction of matter are closely linked processes, we propose in this work a brief thermodynamic study of dark energy considering that particles can be created or destroyed in the fluid. We derive new expressions for quantities such as particle density, entropy density etc. that have been shown to be sensitive to this new ingredient. We also obtain new thermodynamic constraints and compare them with those where the number of particles is conserved. In particular, we found that in the presence of a sink, dark energy tends towards the cosmological constant over time regardless of the sign of its chemical potential and without violating the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Loop-Induced Decays of Leptophilic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptophilic sub-MeV spin-zero dark matter (DM) decays into photons via one-loop processes, a scenario that has been in part overlooked in current literature. In this work, we provide updated and comprehensive upper limits on scalar, pseudo-scalar, and axion-like DM-electron couplings based on the latest NPIPE cosmic microwave background data from Planck. Our bounds on the couplings are not only competitive with astrophysical and terrestrial experiments, but outperform them in certain regions of parameter space. Notably, we present the most stringent limits to date on scalar DM with masses around a few keV and pseudo-scalar DM with masses between 100 eV and a few keV. Additionally, we explore, for the first time, the impact of implementing a cosmology-consistent treatment of energy deposition into the cosmic medium.</description>

      <title>Going deeper into the dark with COSMOS-Web: JWST unveils the total contribution of Radio-Selected NIRfaint galaxies to the cosmic Star Formation Rate Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first follow-up with JWST of radio-selected NIRfaint galaxies as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies ($S_{\rm 3 GHz}&gt;11.5$ $\mu$Jy; i.e. S/N$&gt;5$) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W$&gt;26.1$ mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured ($\langle A_{\rm v} \rangle \sim3.5$ mag), massive ($\langle M_\star \rangle \sim10^{10.8}$ M$_\odot$) and star-forming galaxies ($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle\sim300$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) located at $\langle z \rangle\sim3.6$, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at $z\sim4.5$. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XXI: Triaxiality and projection effects in time-delay cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) is crucial for improving the precision and accuracy of time-delay cosmography. Joint analyses of lensing and stellar kinematics have been widely adopted to break the MSD. A 3D mass and stellar tracer population is required to accurately interpret the kinematics data. We aim at forward-modeling the projection effects in strong lensing and kinematics observables, and finding the best model assumption for the stellar kinematics analysis which leads to unbiased interpretation of the MSD. We numerically simulate the projection and selection effects for both a triaxial ETG sample from the IllustrisTNG simulation and an axisymmetric sample which matches the properties of slow-rotator galaxies representative of the strong lens galaxy population. Using the axisymmetric sample, we generate mock kinematics observables with spherically-aligned axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and assess kinematic recovery under different model assumptions. Using the triaxial sample, we quantify the random uncertainty introduced by modeling triaxial galaxies with axisymmetric JAM. We show that a spherical JAM analysis of spatially unresolved kinematic data introduces a bias of up to 2%-4% (depending on the intrinsic shape of the lens) in the inferred MSD. Our model largely corrects this bias, resulting in a residual random uncertainty in the range of 0-2.1% in the stellar velocity dispersion (0-4.2% in $H_0$) depending on the projected ellipticity and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits. This residual uncertainty can be further mitigated using spatially resolved kinematic data which constrain the intrinsic shape. We also show that the random uncertainty in the velocity dispersion recovery using axisymmetric JAM for axisymmetric galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.17%, and the uncertainty using axisymmetric JAM for triaxial galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.25%.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum cosmology of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in Schutz's formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and quantum dynamics of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of a perfect fluid, employing Schutz's formalism to establish a well-defined notion of time. In the classical regime, we derive and solve the equations of motion, obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions. Through canonical quantisation, we formulate the Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum model. By solving its eigenfunctions, we construct the wave function of the Universe and obtain analytical solutions in scenarios dominated by stiff matter. Our results highlight the impact of rainbow gravity on quantum evolution, particularly in modifying the structure of the wave function and shaping the transition from the quantum to the classical regime.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from vacuum bubbles: ultraviolet dependence on wall thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semi-classical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anti-correlation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Reheating after Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reheating process in an axion inflation model where the inflaton couples to non-Abelian gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling. The Chern-Simons coupling leads to the efficient production of gauge fields via a tachyonic instability during inflation, whose implications have been actively studied in the literatures. Moreover, it has been recently pointed out that the produced gauge fields can be even thermalized during inflation, leading to warm inflation. Apparently, these findings seem to imply that the reheating is completed immediately after inflation because the tachyonic instability or the thermal friction induced by the Chern-Simons coupling cause the inflaton condensate to decay rapidly. Contrary to this naive expectation, however, we show that, in most of the parameter space, either the inflaton condensate, the inflaton particles, or the glueballs once dominate the Universe and their perturbative decay completes the reheating.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations of ProtoClusters in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

Abstract: The study of protoclusters at cosmic noon is essential to understand the impact on galaxies of the environment and of the transformational processes occurring in this epoch. This work tests the predictions of the DIANOGA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster progenitors at z=2.2, comparing them with observations, and investigates the environmental effects on galaxies by comparing protoclusters with an average volume of the Universe. We analyze 14 protoclusters and a cosmological box of 49 cMpc/h per side. We compare predictions and observations of the galaxy properties, including colors of galaxies obtained with radiative transfer, to analyze UVJ diagrams. We showed that the DIANOGA simulations produce a galaxy stellar mass function in broad agreement with observations, with a higher fraction of high-mass galaxies ($M_{\ast}&gt;10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$) in massive halos in protoclusters, compared to the box. The same signal, with lower significance, is also observed in the wide-field protocluster structures, indicating an accelerated evolution of galaxies before their infall into massive halos. Our simulations underestimate SFRs of galaxies both in protoclusters and in the box, compared to observations, due to low gas reservoirs. We find a weak suppression of SFRs in protocluster galaxies (~0.05 dex), compared to the box, increasing up to ~0.25 dex in massive halos. The quenched galaxy fraction varies significantly across different protocluster halos, consistent with observations. The simulations show a strong dependence of quenched fractions on halo mass and an excess of quenched galaxies in the wide-field protocluster region, compared to the cosmological box. UVJ diagram analysis shows qualitative agreement with observed color distributions of star-forming and quenched galaxies, except for few massive galaxies with steeper reddening vectors than typically assumed in observations.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Radio Telescope Dark Matter Search in the L and S Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03439v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic dark matter in its most general form can be detected through its decay or annihilation to a quasimonochromatic radio line. Assuming only that this line is consistent with the most general properties of the expected phase space of our Milky Way halo, we have developed and carried out a novel model-independent search for dark matter in the L and S bands. More specifically, the search selects for a line that exhibits a Doppler shift with position according to the solar motion through a static halo and similarly varies in intensity with position with respect to the galactic center. Over the combined L- and S-band range 1020 - 2700 MHz, radiative annihilation of dark matter is excluded above $\langle\sigma v\rangle \approx 10^{-30} \text{ cm}^3 \text{ s}^{-1}$, and for decay above $\lambda \approx 10^{-32} \text{ s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Exact CMB B-mode power spectrum from anisotropic cosmic birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode power spectrum resulting from anisotropic cosmic birefringence, without relying on the thin approximation of the last scattering surface. Specifically, we consider the influence of anisotropic cosmic birefringence arising from massless axion-like particles. Comparing our results to those obtained using the thin approximation, we observe a suppression in the amplitude of the $B$-mode power spectrum by approximately an order of magnitude at large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 10$) and by a factor of two at small angular scales ($\ell \gtrsim 100$) when not employing the thin approximation. We also constrain the amplitude of the angular power spectrum of the scale-invariant anisotropic cosmic birefringence using the SPTpol $B$-mode power spectrum. We find that the amplitude is constrained as $A_{\rm CB}\times10^4=1.03^{+0.91}_{-0.97}\,(2\,\sigma)$.

      <title>Mapping the Hubble Flow from z$ \sim $0 to z$ \sim$7.5 with HII Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, \( \Lambda \). Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from \( z \approx 0 \) to \( z \approx 7.5 \). Using a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the \(\text{L}-\sigma\) relation that correlates the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach allows the mapping of the Universe expansion history over more than 12 billion years, covering 95\% of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space $\lbrace h, \Omega_m, w_0\rbrace = \lbrace 0.731\pm0.039, 0.302^{+0.12}_{-0.069}, -1.01^{+0.52}_{-0.29}\rbrace $ (statistical) for a flat Universe. Our results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and imply a lack of change in the photo-kinematical properties of the young massive ionizing clusters in HII galaxies across most of the history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological parameters using void statistics from the SDSS survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify voids as maximal non-overlapping spheres within the haloes of the Uchuu simulation and three smaller halo simulation boxes with smaller volume and different $\sigma_{8}$ values, and galaxies with redshift in the range $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.132$ and absolute magnitude in the $r-$band $M_{r}&lt;-20.5$ of 32 Uchuu-SDSS simulated lightcones the seventh release of \textit{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey} (SDSS DR7) survey. We compute the Void Probability Function and the abundance of voids larger than $r$ predicted by the theoretical framework used in this work and we check that it predicts successfully both void functions for the halo simulation boxes. Next, we asses the potential of this theoretical framework to constrain cosmological parameters using Uchuu-SDSS void statistics, and we calculate the confidence levels using Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to infer the values of $\sigma_{8}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and H$_{0}$ from the SDSS sample used. The constraints we obtain from the SDSS survey sample used. The results are: $\sigma_{8}=1.028^{+0.273}_{-0.305}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.296^{+0.110}_{-0.102}$, H$_{0}=83.43\pm^{+29.27}_{-27.70}$, $\Gamma=0.1947^{+0.0578}_{-0.0516}$ and S$_{8}$=1.017$^{+0.363}_{-0.359}$. If we combine these constraints with KiDS-1000+DESY3, we get $\sigma_{8}=0.858^{+0.040}_{-0.040}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.257\pm^{+0.023}_{-0.020}$, H$_{0}=74.17^{+4.66}_{-4.66}$ and S$_{8}$=0.794$^{+0.016}_{-0.016}$. The combined uncertainties are approximately a factor 2-3 smaller than only-Weak-Lensing uncertainties. This is a consequence of the orientation of the confidence level contours of SDSS voids and Weak Lensing in the plane $\sigma_{8}-\Omega_{\rm m}$, which are almost orthogonal (abridged).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Impact of Redshift Space Distortion on Persistent Homology of cosmic matter density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing summary statistics obtained from Persistent Homology (PH), we investigate the influence of Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) on the topology of excursion sets formed through the super-level filtration method applied to three-dimensional matter density fields. The synthetic fields simulated by the Quijote suite in both real and redshift spaces are smoothed by accounting for the Gaussian smoothing function with different scales. The RSD leads a tendency for clusters ($\tilde{\beta}_0$) to shift towards higher thresholds, while filament loops ($\tilde{\beta}_1$) and cosmic voids ($\tilde{\beta}_2$) migrate towards lower thresholds. Notably, $\tilde{\beta}_2$ exhibits greater sensitivity to RSD compared to clusters and independent loops. As the smoothing scales increase, the amplitude of the reduced Betti number curve ($\tilde{\beta}_k$) decreases, and the corresponding peak position shifts towards the mean threshold. Conversely, the amplitude of $\tilde{\beta}_k$ remains almost unchanged with variations in redshift for $z\in[0-3]$. The analysis of persistent entropy and the overall abundance of $k$-holes indicates that the linear Kaiser effect plays a significant role compared to the non-linear effect for $R \gtrsim 30$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$, whereas persistent entropy proves to be a reliable measure against non-linear influences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at reionization using Planck PR4 polarization data for the first time. Several recent analyses of WMAP and Planck polarization data have found a tantalizing hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence. Ongoing and future CMB experiments will test isotropic cosmic birefringence by improving the absolute angle calibration and understanding the intrinsic parity-odd power spectrum of the Galactic foregrounds. Alternatively, measuring anisotropies in cosmic birefringence and its time evolution is also a key observable to confirm the signal of cosmic birefringence and to investigate its origin. We discuss estimators of anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at different redshifts. We then estimate anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at reionization from the PR4 data, showing that the power spectrum is consistent with null. We find that the model proposed by Ferreira et al. (2024) is still consistent with the observation. Future full-sky CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and PICO will help tighten the tomographic constraint to test models of cosmic birefringence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that a sharply peaked curvature spectrum is often considered in the literature, we examine theoretical constraints on the sharpness of such a spectrum. In particular, we show that the sharply peaked curvature power spectrum, originating from the enhancement of subhorizon perturbations during inflation, is significantly constrained by energy conservation. While the constraints do not depend on the exact form of inflaton potential, we also study concrete inflaton potentials that realize a sharply peaked curvature spectrum and how theoretical limits are saturated in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bias due to non-Gaussian Foregrounds in an Optimal Reconstruction of CMB Lensing and Temperature Power Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the magnitude of the bias due to non-Gaussian extragalactic foregrounds on the optimal reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential and temperature power spectra. The reconstruction is performed using a Bayesian inference method known as the marginal unbiased score expansion (MUSE). We apply MUSE to a minimum variance combination of multifrequency maps drawn from the Agora publicly available simulations of the lensed CMB and correlated extragalactic foreground emission. Taking noise levels appropriate to two years of data with the SPT-3G instrument on the South Pole Telescope, we find no statistically significant bias in the MUSE reconstruction when limited to angular multipoles $\ell \leq 3000$. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ bias in the recovered lensing potential power spectrum when smaller scale modes ($\ell \leq 3500$) are included. This work is a first step toward understanding the impact of extragalactic foregrounds on optimal reconstructions of CMB temperature and lensing potential power spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a comprehensive derivation of the energy density in the stochastic gravitational-wave background $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)$, and show how this quantity is measured in ground-based detectors such as Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and Pulsar Timing Arrays. By definition $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f) \propto S_h(f)$ -- the power spectral density (PSD) of the Fourier modes of the gravitational-wave background. However, this is often confused with the PSD of the strain signal, which we call $S_\mathrm{gw}(f)$, and is a detector-dependent quantity. This has led to confusing definitions of $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)$ in the literature which differ by factors of up to 5 when written in a detector-dependent way. In addition to clarifying this confusion, formulas presented in this paper facilitate easy comparison of results from different detector groups, and how to convert from one measure of the strength of the background (or an upper limit) to another.

Abstract: In this brief article, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression, taking into account the appropriate timescales resulting from both physical and instrumental constraints. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a hundredth of an astronomical unit - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, suboptimal, and general trajectories. The main conclusion is that detection seems clearly out of reach.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 314.5$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>
