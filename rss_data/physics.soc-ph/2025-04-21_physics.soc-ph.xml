      <title>Multistability and High Codimension Bifurcations in Synergistic Epidemics on Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of network heterogeneity on synergistic contagion dynamics. By extending a synergistic contagion model to diverse heterogeneous network topologies, we uncover the emergence of novel dynamical regimes characterized by multiple stable states, separated by a rich set of bifurcations reaching up to codimension 4. Additionally, we demonstrate how synergy fundamentally reshapes the influence of nodes based on their degree. Unlike in non-synergistic epidemics, low-degree nodes can play a pivotal role in enabling network invasion at the onset of spread, while high-degree nodes can trigger explosive contagion. These findings challenge conventional control strategies, highlighting the need for new approaches to enhance or suppress synergistic contagion.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Informed by Micro and Mesoscopic Statistical Physics Methods for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the structural organization of complex networks. Previous methods, particularly those from statistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network structures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To address this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates machine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach enhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth labels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results, effectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing misclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring the critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and statistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance network analysis and uncover complex structural patterns.</description>

      <title>On a stochastic epidemic SIR model with non homogenous population: a toy model for HIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we generalise a simple discrete time stochastic SIR type model defined by Tuckwell and Williams. The SIR model by Tuckwell and Williams assumes a homogeneous population, a fixed infectious period, and a strict transition from susceptible to infected to recovered. In contrast, our model introduces two groups, $A$ and $B$, where group $B$ has a higher risk of infection due to increased contact rates. Additionally, the duration in the infected class follows a probability distribution rather than being fixed. Finally, individuals in group $B$ can transition directly to the recovered class R, allowing us to analyze the impact of this preventive measure on disease spread. Finally, we apply this model to the spread of HIV, analyzing how risk behaviors, rapid testing, and PrEP-like therapies influence the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modelling Immunity in Agent-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccination policies play a central role in public health interventions and models are often used to assess the effectiveness of these policies. Many vaccines are leaky, in which case the observed vaccine effectiveness depends on the force of infection. Within models, the immunity parameters required for agent-based models to achieve observed vaccine effectiveness values are further influenced by model features such as its transmission algorithm, contact network structure, and approach to simulating vaccination. We present a method for determining parameters in agent-based models such that a set of target immunity values is achieved. We construct a dataset of desired population-level immunity values against various disease outcomes considering both vaccination and prior infection from COVID-19. This dataset incorporates immunological data, data collection methodologies, immunity models, and biological insights. We then describe how we choose minimal parameters for continuous waning immunity curves that result in those target values being realized in simulations. We use simulations of the household secondary attack rates to establish a relationship between the protection per infection attempt and overall immunity, thus accounting for the dependence of protection from acquisition on model features and the force of infection.</description>

      <title>Exponential rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex networks, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>Website visits can predict angler presence using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting recreational angler effort is important for sustainable fisheries management. However, conventional methods of measuring angler effort, such as surveys, can be costly and limited in both time and spatial extent. Models that predict angler effort based on environmental or economic factors typically rely on historical data, which often limits their spatial and temporal generalizability due to data scarcity. In this study, high-resolution data from an online fishing platform and easily accessible auxiliary data were tested to predict daily boat presence and aerial counts of boats at almost 200 lakes over five years in Ontario, Canada. Lake-information website visits alone enabled predicting daily angler boat presence with 78% accuracy. While incorporating additional environmental, socio-ecological, weather and angler-reported features into machine learning models did not remarkably improve prediction performance of boat presence, they were substantial for the prediction of boat counts. Models achieved an R2 of up to 0.77 at known lakes included in the model training, but they performed poorly for unknown lakes (R2 = 0.21). The results demonstrate the value of integrating data from online fishing platforms into predictive models and highlight the potential of machine learning models to enhance fisheries management.</description>

      <title>Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>Wealth inequality and utility: Effect evaluation of redistribution and consumption morals using the macro-econophysical coupled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and increasing utility are critical issues. This study reveals the effects of redistribution and consumption morals on wealth inequality and utility. To this end, we present a novel approach that couples the dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with the interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics. With this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on consumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and consumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that: under-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely, over-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate moral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These findings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral importance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of redistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a human mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist, instead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The practical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of worker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the market, with moral consensus and its operation.</description>
