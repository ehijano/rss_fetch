      <title>On construction schemes: building the uncountable from finite pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Phd. thesis, a structural analysis of construction schemes is developed. The importance of this study will be justified by constructing several distinct combinatorial objects which have been of great interest in mathematics. We then continue the study of capturing axioms associated to construction schemes. From them, we construct several uncountable structures whose existence is known to be independent from the usual axioms of Set Theory.</description>

      <title>Flows of linear orders on sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the topological dynamics of the automorphism group of a particular sparse graph M_1 resulting from an ab initio Hrushovski construction. We show that minimal subflows of the flow of linear orders on M_1 have all orbits meagre, partially answering a question of Tsankov regarding results of Evans, Hubicka and Nesetril on the topological dynamics of automorphism groups of sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals [0,\infty], showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality -log \dashv 1/exp, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>Gabriel-Ulmer Duality for Topoi, An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04965v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to relate the classical result of Gabriel-Ulmer to the geometry of topoi. The usage of the attribute 'left exact' when dealing with functors involved in this duality is indeed not casual and it is related to the geometrical side of the story, i.e. sheaf theory, as in \cite{SGA}. Thought to be a very basic introduction to the subject, it is mostly self-contained. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the fundamentals of category theory, no further prerequisite knowledge is required. The proof of Gabriel-Ulmer duality follows \cite{MP}.</description>

      <title>Complexity Classification Transfer for CSPs via Algebraic Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of infinite-domain constraint satisfaction problems: our basic setting is that a complexity classification for the CSPs of first-order expansions of a structure $\mathfrak A$ can be transferred to a classification of the CSPs of first-order expansions of another structure $\mathfrak B$. We exploit a product of structures (the algebraic product) that corresponds to the product of the respective polymorphism clones and present a complete complexity classification of the CSPs for first-order expansions of the $n$-fold algebraic power of $(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$. This is proved by various algebraic and logical methods in combination with knowledge of the polymorphisms of the tractable first-order expansions of $(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$ and explicit descriptions of the expressible relations in terms of syntactically restricted first-order formulas. By combining our classification result with general classification transfer techniques, we obtain surprisingly strong new classification results for highly relevant formalisms such as Allen's Interval Algebra, the $n$-dimensional Block Algebra, and the Cardinal Direction Calculus, even if higher-arity relations are allowed. Our results confirm the infinite-domain tractability conjecture for classes of structures that have been difficult to analyse with older methods. For the special case of structures with binary signatures, the results can be substantially strengthened and tightly connected to Ord-Horn formulas; this solves several longstanding open problems from the AI literature.</description>

      <title>The externally definable Ramsey property and fixed points on type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the externally definable Ramsey property, a weakening of the Ramsey property for ultrahomogeneous structures, where the only colourings considered are those that are externally definable: that is, definable with parameters in an elementary extension. We show a number of basic results analogous to the classical Ramsey theory, and show that, for an ultrahomogeneous structure M, the externally definable Ramsey property is equivalent to the dynamical statement that, for each natural number n, every subflow of the space of n-types with parameters in M has a fixed point. We discuss a range of examples, including results regarding the lexicographic product of structures.</description>

      <title>Sparse graphs and the fixed points on type spaces property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the topological dynamics of the automorphism groups of omega-categorical sparse graphs resulting from Hrushovski constructions. Specifically, we consider the fixed points on type spaces property, which a structure M has if, for each positive integer n, every Aut(M)-subflow of the space of n-types has a fixed point. Extending a result of Evans, Hubicka and Nesetril, we show that there exists an omega-categorical structure M, resulting from a Hrushovski construction, such that no omega-categorical expansion of M has the fixed points on type spaces property.</description>

      <title>Base-extension Semantics for S5 Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics -- in particular, a base-extension semantics -- for multi-agent S5 modal logic (and hence also for the usual unindexed S5). Following the inferentialist interpretation of logic, this gives us a semantics in which validity is based on proof rather than truth. In base-extension semantics, the validity of formulae is generated by provability in a `base' of atomic rules and an inductive definition of the validity of the connectives. Base-extension semantics for many interesting logics has been explored by several authors and, in particular, a base-extension semantics for the modal logics K, KT, K4, and S4 has been developed by the present authors. Here, we give a base-extension semantics for multi-agent S5 with $\square_a$, for an agent a, as our primary operators, framed as the knowledge operator K_a. Similarly to Kripke semantics, we make use of relational structure between bases, allowing us to establish a correspondence between certain bases and worlds. We use this to establish the appropriate soundness and completeness results. We conclude by discussing how this semantics can be extended to Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DEL) starting with Public Announcement Logic (PAL).</description>
