      <title>Diffusion Signals Reveal Hidden Connections: A Physics-Inspired Framework for Link Prediction via Personalized PageRank Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction in complex networks--identifying the missing or future connections--remains a cornerstone problem for understanding network evolution and function, yet existing methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with theoretical rigor across heterogeneous topologies. This work introduces a physically principled framework, Diffusion Distance with Personalized PageRank (D-PPR), which unifies static topology with dynamic information flow by modeling nodes as signal sources propagating through the network via Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors. The method quantifies node-pair similarity through the graph Laplacian-governed diffusion distance between their topology-aware signal distributions, thereby bridging microscopic interactions with macroscopic network dynamics. Systematic benchmarking on synthetic (Barab\'asi-Albert, LFR) and seven large-scale real-world networks spanning technology, biology, and social domains demonstrates that D-PPR achieves highly competitive performance, yielding favorable results when compared to representative local and global heuristics, particularly in sparse and modular networks. These findings establish a rigorous foundation for physics-inspired link prediction by revealing that incorporating dynamical processes into structural similarity metrics enables deeper insights into network connectivity patterns, offering both methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives on the interplay between topology and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constructing Political Coordinates: Aggregating Over the Opposition for Diverse News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Core-Periphery and Community Detection Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meso-scale structures, such as core-periphery (CP) and community structure, have attracted significant attention in modern network science. While communities are characterized by dense intra-group and sparse inter-group connections, CP structures consist of a densely interconnected core and a loosely connected periphery, where peripheral nodes are typically linked to the core. Despite growing interest, identifying CP structures remains an ill-posed problem, with no universally accepted definition or standardized detection methodology. This ambiguity has led to conceptual overlaps, inconsistent evaluation metrics and slowed methodological progress. In this review, we provide a structured overview of foundational concepts, recent advances, key challenges and comparative evaluations of CP detection approaches, along with a discussion of their interplay with community structure and applications in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Lossy communication constrains iterated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans' distinctive role in the world can largely be attributed to our capacity for iterated learning, a process by which knowledge is expanded and refined over generations. A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations.</description>

      <title>Perplexity-Homophily Index: Homophily through Diversity in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems are often better modeled as hypergraphs, where edges represent group interactions involving multiple entities. Understanding and quantifying homophily (similarity-driven association) in such networks is essential for analyzing community formation and information flow. We propose a hyperedge-centric framework to quantify homophily in hypergraphs. Each interaction is represented as a hyperedge, and its interaction perplexity measures the effective number of distinct attributes it contains. Comparing this observed perplexity with a degree-preserving random baseline defines the diversity gap, which quantifies how diverse an interaction is than expected by chance. The global homophily score for a network, called Perplexity-Homophily Index, is computed by averaging the normalized diversity gap across all hyperedges. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed index captures the full distribution of homophily and reveals how homophilic and heterophilic tendencies vary with interaction size in hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On Yukawa Potential Centrality for Identification of Influential Spreaders in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental challenge for understanding how information, influence, and contagion propagate through interconnected systems. Conventional centrality measures, particularly gravity-based models, often depend on pairwise interaction forces and a fixed radius of influence, which oversimplify the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of real networks. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel non-interactive, action-based model, termed Yukawa Potential Centrality (YPC), which adapts the physical Yukawa potential to the topology of complex networks. Unlike gravity models, YPC computes a scalar potential for each node rather than pairwise forces, dynamically adjusting its radius of influence according to local structural properties. This formulation establishes a physically interpretable bridge between potential theory and network science, while significantly reducing computational complexity, from quadratic to near-linear time. The model is evaluated across both synthetic and real-world social networks, and its node rankings are compared with classical centrality indices and epidemic spreading models (SI and SIS). Experimental findings reveal that YPC exhibits a strong positive correlation with the SIS model and effectively isolates key spreaders, even within highly irregular topologies. These results demonstrate that YPC provides a scalable, adaptive, and theoretically grounded framework for influence analysis in social, biological, and communication networks.</description>

      <title>Motivational Climate Effects on Communications, Emotional-Social States, and Performance in Collaborative Gaming Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study explores the effects of motivational climate on communication features, emotional states, collective efficacy, and performance in collaborative gaming environments. Forty participants with no prior gaming experience were randomly assigned to 20 gender-matched teams of three (including one confederate) across two motivational climates: positive-supportive (PS) or neutral-unsupported (NU) (10 teams per condition). Team members completed three progressively difficult levels of Overcooked! 2 during which communication contents, emotional responses, collective efficacy, and performance outcomes were observed and coded. Mixed-design MANOVAs and ANOVAs were employed to examine the effects of motivational climate and task difficulty on communication patterns, emotions, collective efficacy, and performance. Chi-square analyses were performed to test communication content differences between conditions. Results revealed that PS team members significantly outperformed NU teams at lower task difficulty level, but this advantage diminished as task complexity increased. Communication analysis revealed that PS team members utilized significantly more action-oriented, factual, and emotional/motivational statements, while NU team members used more statements of uncertainty and non-task-related communication. The percentage of the talk time increased with difficulty across both climate conditions. PS team members maintained more positive emotional profiles throughout, with higher excitement and happiness scores and lower anxiety, dejection, and anger compared to NU team members. Furthermore, PS team members reported consistently higher collective efficacy beliefs across all difficulty levels. These findings reveal that positive motivational climate enhances team communication effectiveness, emotional resilience, and performance outcomes in challenging collaborative environments.</description>

      <title>Community-Aligned Behavior Under Uncertainty: Evidence of Epistemic Stance Transfer in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) are aligned to a specific online community, do they exhibit generalizable behavioral patterns that mirror that community's attitudes and responses to new uncertainty, or are they simply recalling patterns from training data? We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>Privacy Concerns and ChatGPT: Exploring Online Discourse through the Lens of Information Practice on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As millions of people use ChatGPT for tasks such as education, writing assistance, and health advice, concerns have grown about how personal prompts and data are stored and used. This study explores how Reddit users collectively negotiate and respond to these privacy concerns. Posts were collected from three major subreddits -- r/Chatgpt, r/privacy, and r/OpenAI -- between November 2022 and May 2025. An iterative keyword search followed by manual screening resulted in a final dataset of 426 posts and 1,900 comments. Using information practice as the theoretical lens, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis to identify collective practices of risk negotiation, validated with BERTopic topic modeling to ensure thematic saturation. Findings revealed risk signaling, norm-setting, and resignation as dominant discourses, and collective troubleshooting and advocacy for privacy-preserving alternatives as key adaptive practices. Reddit functions as a site of collective sense-making where users surface risks, establish informal norms, and share strategies for mitigating privacy threats, offering insights for AI design and privacy literacy initiatives.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Remote Working on Scientific Collaboration and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic shifted academic collaboration from in-person to remote interactions. This study explores, for the first time, the effects on scientific collaborations and impact of such a shift, comparing research output before, during, and after the pandemic. Using large-scale bibliometric data, we track the evolution of collaboration networks and the resulting impact of research over time. Our findings are twofold: first, the geographic distribution of collaborations significantly shifted, with a notable increase in cross-border partnerships after 2020, indicating a reduction in the constraints of geographic proximity. Second, despite the expansion of collaboration networks, there was a concerning decline in citation impact, suggesting that the absence of spontaneous in-person interactions-which traditionally foster deep discussions and idea exchange-negatively affected research quality. As hybrid work models in academia gain traction, this study highlights the need for universities and research organizations to carefully consider the balance between remote and in-person engagement.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for both Homophilic and Heterophilic Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</description>

      <title>GContextFormer: A global context-aware hybrid multi-head attention approach with scaled additive aggregation for multimodal trajectory prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.</description>

      <title>Trade-Off Between Multiplicity and Specificity in the Inter-layer Connectivity of non-identical Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coupled dynamics of multilayer networks with symmetric (MLs) and asymmetric (MLas) inter-layer connections. The symmetric inter-layer connections arise from a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of different layers. In contrast, asymmetry results from the multiplicity of inter-layer connections, achieved by randomizing the links while preserving their overall density, thereby allowing one-to-many inter-layer connections. We investigate how different types of inter-layer coupling impact the dynamics of non-identical multilayer networks. We find that the specificity of one-to-one inter-layer connections facilitates intra-layer synchronization (ILS). In contrast, for networks with random inter-layer connectivity, ILS depends on how randomness affects intra-layer homomorphism (the set of permutations that preserve the network structure). Furthermore, amplitude death (AD) in MLs is observed at lower connectivity strength and frequency mismatch than the MLas. Moreover, AD in MLs depends on the density and topology, but does not depend on the size of the networks. On the other hand, AD in MLas is influenced by network size in addition to density, topology, and inter-layer mismatches. Moreover, both the MLs and MLas exhibit multi-stability, with the faster layer exhibiting a remanent periodic phase-locked oscillation, irrespective of the topology and inter-layer connectivity. In addition, remnant synchrony between nodes with homomorphic relationships is observed in the slower layer. Overall, we propose that symmetric inter-layer connections should be preferable for achieving intra-layer synchronization-regardless of global synchronization-and for sustaining permanent memory in multilayer networks with mismatched nodes across layers. However, to mitigate AD at low coupling values and layer mismatch, asymmetric inter-layer connectivity is more advantageous.</description>

      <title>When Does Bottom-up Beat Top-down in Hierarchical Community Detection?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive (top-down) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative (bottom-up) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a linkage method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their applications in network analysis.</description>

      <title>A Network-Based Measure of Cosponsorship Influence on Bill Passing in the United States House of Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each year, the United States Congress considers thousands of legislative proposals to select bills to present to the US President to sign into law. Naturally, the decision processes of members of Congress are subject to peer influence. In this paper, we examine the effect on bill passage of accrued influence between US Congress members in the US House of Representatives. We explore how the influence of a bill's cosponsors affects the bill's outcome (specifically, whether or not it passes in the House). We define a notion of influence by analyzing the structure of a network that we construct using cosponsorship dynamics. We award `influence' between a pair of Congress members when they cosponsor a bill that achieves some amount of legislative success. We find that properties of the bill cosponsorship network can be a useful signal to examine influence in Congress; they help explain why some bills pass and others fail. We compare our measure of influence to off-the-shelf centrality measures and conclude that our influence measure is more indicative of bill passage.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics are associated with misinformation sharing activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics-average daily tweet count, and account age-can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects differ depending on the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recruiting passive candidates, i.e., individuals not actively seeking jobs but open to compelling opportunities, remains one of the hardest challenges in digital recruitment. Motivated by a real collaboration with an industry partner, we introduce the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model: a simple but rich agent-based framework that couples network diffusion with the possibility of halting through job applications. Agents can either recommend vacancies to peers or apply themselves, and incentives increase the likelihood of recommendation, mobilizing otherwise passive candidates. The IHC bridges research on social network diffusion, coordinated task completion, and labor economics by modeling heterogeneous skills, job specificities, and network structures, including homophily. We derive analytical boundaries that characterize diffusion and failure regimes, and we show, through simulations, that the IHC reproduces the empirical chain-length distributions of Travers and Milgram, and of Dodds, with only coarse calibration. Across synthetic (ER, BA, homophilic) and real networks (SMS, e-mail, Twitter), the IHC achieves comparable or higher success rates than direct-recommendation baselines, while requiring fewer applicants. Our findings suggest that the IHC captures core mechanisms of coordinated task completion, offering both a theoretical contribution and a practical foundation for recruitment systems designed to reach and engage passive candidates.</description>

      <title>Efficient Community Detection Over Streaming Bipartite Networks (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The streaming bipartite graph is widely used to model the dynamic relationship between two types of entities in various real-world applications, including movie recommendations, location-based services, and online shopping. Since it contains abundant information, discovering the dense subgraph with high structural cohesiveness (i.e., community detection) in the bipartite streaming graph is becoming a valuable problem. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study the structure of the community on the butterfly motif in the bipartite graph. We propose a novel problem, named Community Detection over Streaming Bipartite Network (CD-SBN), which aims to retrieve qualified communities with user-specific query keywords and high structural cohesiveness at snapshot and continuous scenarios. In particular, we formulate the user relationship score in the weighted bipartite network via the butterfly pattern and define a novel $(k,r,\sigma)$-bitruss as the community structure. To efficiently tackle the CD-SBN problem, we design effective pruning strategies to rule out false alarms of $(k,r,\sigma)$-bitruss and propose a hierarchical synopsis to facilitate the CD-SBN processing. We develop efficient algorithms to answer snapshot and continuous CD-SBN queries by traversing the synopsis and applying pruning strategies. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our CD-SBN approach on real/synthetic streaming bipartite networks.</description>

      <title>Properties and Expressivity of Linear Geometric Centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrality indices are used to rank the nodes of a graph by importance: this is a common need in many concrete situations (social networks, citation networks, web graphs, for instance) and it was discussed many times in sociology, psychology, mathematics and computer science, giving rise to a whole zoo of definitions of centrality. Although they differ widely in nature, many centrality measures are based on shortest-path distances: such centralities are often referred to as geometric. Geometric centralities can use the shortest-path-length information in many different ways, but most of the existing geometric centralities can be defined as a linear transformation of the distance-count vector (that is, the vector containing, for every index t, the number of nodes at distance t).
  In this paper we study this class of centralities, that we call linear (geometric) centralities, in their full generality. In particular, we look at them in the light of the axiomatic approach, and we study their expressivity: we show to what extent linear centralities can be used to distinguish between nodes in a graph, and how many different rankings of nodes can be induced by linear centralities on a given graph. The latter problem (which has a number of possible applications, especially in an adversarial setting) is solved by means of a linear programming formulation, which is based on Farkas' lemma, and is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Distance-Count Matrices is Difficult</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axiomatization of centrality measures often involves proving that something cannot hold by providing a counterexample (i.e., a graph for which that specific centrality index fails to have a given property). In the context of geometric centralities, building such counterexamples requires constructing a graph with specific distance counts between nodes, as expressed by its distance-count matrix. We prove that deciding whether a matrix is the distance-count matrix of a graph is strongly NP-complete. This negative result implies that a brute-force approach to building this kind of counterexample is out of question, and cleverer approaches are required.</description>

      <title>Lost in translation: using global fact-checks to measure multilingual misinformation prevalence, spread, and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation and disinformation are growing threats in the digital age, affecting people across languages and borders. However, no research has investigated the prevalence of multilingual misinformation and quantified the extent to which misinformation diffuses across languages. This paper investigates the prevalence and dynamics of multilingual misinformation through an analysis of 264,487 fact-checks spanning 95 languages. To study the evolution of claims over time and mutations across languages, we represent fact-checks with multilingual sentence embeddings and build a graph where semantically similar claims are linked. We provide quantitative evidence of repeated fact-checking efforts and establish that claims diffuse across languages. Specifically, we find that while the majority of misinformation claims are only fact-checked once, 10.26%, corresponding to more than 27,000 claims, are checked multiple times. Using fact-checks as a proxy for the spread of misinformation, we find 32.26% of repeated claims cross linguistic boundaries, suggesting that some misinformation permeates language barriers. However, spreading patterns exhibit strong assortativity, with misinformation more likely to spread within the same language or language family. Next we show that fact-checkers take more time to fact-check claims that have crossed language barriers and model the temporal and cross-lingual evolution of claims. We analyze connected components and shortest paths connecting different versions of a claim finding that claims gradually drift over time and undergo greater alteration when traversing languages. Misinformation changes over time, reducing the effectiveness of static claim matching algorithms. The findings advocate for expanded information sharing between fact-checkers globally while underscoring the importance of localized verification.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Detect Misinformation in Scientific News Reporting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types and is still in its nascence. Most research on the validity of scientific reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge. In doing so, significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims. Our solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such explicit, labeled claims may not be available. The central research question of this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to detect misinformation in scientific reporting. To this end, we first present a new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the CORD-19 database. Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles. Then, we identify dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation. We propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false representations of scientific findings in the popular press. For each of these architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. We also test these architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B.</description>

      <title>Forgetful by Design? A Critical Audit of YouTube's Search API for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3), a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also observe severe temporal decay in video discoverability: the number of retrievable videos for a given period drops dramatically within just 20-60 days of publication, even though these videos remain on the platform. This potentially undermines research designs that rely on systematic data collection. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing 'freshness' over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</description>
