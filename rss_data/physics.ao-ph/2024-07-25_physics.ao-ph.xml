      <title>How optimal control of polar sea-ice depends on its tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Earth system components are at a high risk of undergoing rapid and irreversible qualitative changes or `tipping', due to increasing climate warming. Potential tipping elements include Arctic sea-ice, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and tropical coral reefs. Amidst such immediate concerns, it has become necessary to investigate the feasibility of arresting or even reversing the crossing of tipping thresholds using feedback control. In this paper, we study the control of an idealized diffusive energy balance model (EBM) for the Earth's climate; this model has two tipping points due to strong co-albedo feedback. One of these tipping points is a `small icecap' instability responsible for a rapid transition to an ice-free climate state under increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. We develop an optimal control strategy for the EBM under different climate forcing scenarios with the goal of reversing sea ice loss while minimizing costs. We find that effective control is achievable for such a system, but the cost of reversing sea-ice loss nearly quadruples for an initial state that has just tipped as compared to a state before reaching the tipping point. We also show that thermal inertia may delay tipping leading to an overshoot of the critical GHG forcing threshold. This may offer a short intervention window (overshoot window) during which the control required to reverse sea-ice loss only scales linearly with intervention time. While systems with larger system inertia may have longer overshoot windows, this increased elbow room comes with a steeper rise in the requisite control once the intervention is delayed past this window. Additionally, we find that the requisite control to restore sea-ice is localized in the polar region.</description>

      <title>The QBO, the annual cycle, and their interactions: Isolating periodic modes with Koopman analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is the dominant mode of variability in the equatorial stratosphere. It is characterized by alternating descending easterly and westerly jets over a period of approximately 28 months. It has long been known that the QBO interactions with the annual cycle, e.g., through variation in tropical upwelling, leading to variations in the descent rate of the jets and, resultingly, the QBO period. Understanding these interactions, however, has been hindered by the fact that conventional measures of the QBO convolve these interactions. Koopman formalism, derived from dynamical systems, allows one to decompose spatio-temporal datasets (or nonlinear systems) into spatial modes that evolve coherently with distinct frequencies. We use a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator on zonal-mean zonal-wind to find modes that correspond to the annual cycle, the QBO, and the nonlinear interactions between the two. From these modes, we establish a data-driven index for a "pure" QBO that is independent of the annual cycle and investigate how the annual cycle modulates the QBO. We begin with what is already known, quantifying the Holton-Tan effect, a nonlinear interaction between the QBO and the annual cycle of the polar stratospheric vortex. We then use the pure QBO to do something new, quantifying how the annual cycle changes the descent rate of the QBO, revealing annual variations with amplitudes comparable to the $30 \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{day}^{-1}$ mean descent rate. We compare these results to the annual variation in tropical upwelling and interpret then with a simple model.</description>

      <title>SUIM project: measuring the upper atmosphere from the ISS by observations of the CXB transmitted through the Earth rim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper atmosphere at the altitude of 60-110 km, the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has the least observational data of all atmospheres due to the difficulties of in-situ observations. Previous studies demonstrated that atmospheric occultation of cosmic X-ray sources is an effective technique to investigate the MLT. Aiming to measure the atmospheric density of the MLT continuously, we are developing an X-ray camera, "Soipix for observing Upper atmosphere as Iss experiment Mission (SUIM)", dedicated to atmospheric observations. SUIM will be installed on the exposed area of the International Space Station (ISS) and face the ram direction of the ISS to point toward the Earth rim. Observing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) transmitted through the atmosphere, we will measure the absorption column density via spectroscopy and thus obtain the density of the upper atmosphere. The X-ray camera is composed of a slit collimator and two X-ray SOI-CMOS pixel sensors (SOIPIX), and will stand on its own and make observations, controlled by a CPU-embedded FPGA "Zynq". We plan to install the SUIM payload on the ISS in 2025 during the solar maximum. In this paper, we report the overview and the development status of this project.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>Evapotranspiration trends over the last 300 years reconstructed from historical weather station observations via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating historical evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding the effects of climate change and human activities on the water cycle. This study used historical weather station data to reconstruct ET trends over the past 300 years with machine learning. A Random Forest model, trained on FLUXNET2015 flux stations' monthly data using precipitation, temperature, aridity index, and rooting depth as predictors, achieved an R2 of 0.66 and a KGE of 0.76 through 10-fold cross-validation. Applied to 5267 weather stations, the model produced monthly ET data showing a general increase in global ET from 1700 to the present, with a notable acceleration after 1900 due to warming. Regional differences were observed, with higher ET increases in mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and decreases in some mid-to-low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. In drylands, ET and temperature were weakly correlated, while in humid areas, the correlation was much higher. The correlation between ET and precipitation has remained stable over the centuries. This study extends the ET data time span, providing valuable insights into long-term historical ET trends and their drivers, aiding in reassessing the impact of historical climate change and human activities on the water cycle and supporting future climate adaptation strategies.</description>
