      <title>The LiteBIRD mission to explore cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{LiteBIRD}, the next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, aims for a launch in Japan's fiscal year 2032, marking a major advancement in the exploration of primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. Orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, this JAXA-led strategic L-class mission will conduct a comprehensive mapping of the CMB polarization across the entire sky. During its 3-year mission, \textit{LiteBIRD} will employ three telescopes within 15 unique frequency bands (ranging from 34 through 448 GHz), targeting a sensitivity of 2.2\,$\mu$K-arcmin and a resolution of 0.5$^\circ$ at 100\,GHz. Its primary goal is to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with an uncertainty $\delta r = 0.001$, including systematic errors and margin. If $r \geq 0.01$, \textit{LiteBIRD} expects to achieve a $&gt;5\sigma$ detection in the $\ell=$2-10 and $\ell=$11-200 ranges separately, providing crucial insight into the early Universe. We describe \textit{LiteBIRD}'s scientific objectives, the application of systems engineering to mission requirements, the anticipated scientific impact, and the operations and scanning strategies vital to minimizing systematic effects. We will also highlight \textit{LiteBIRD}'s synergies with concurrent CMB projects.</description>

      <title>Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep Generative Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</description>

      <title>Experimental end-to-end demonstration of intersatellite absolute ranging for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a gravitational wave detector in space. It relies on a post-processing technique named time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress the overwhelming laser frequency noise by several orders of magnitude. This algorithm requires intersatellite-ranging monitors to provide information on spacecraft separations. To fulfill this requirement, we will use on-ground observatories, optical sideband-sideband beatnotes, pseudo-random noise ranging (PRNR), and time-delay interferometric ranging (TDIR). This article reports on the experimental end-to-end demonstration of a hexagonal optical testbed used to extract absolute ranges via the optical sidebands, PRNR, and TDIR. These were applied for clock synchronization of optical beatnote signals sampled at independent phasemeters. We set up two possible PRNR processing schemes: Scheme 1 extracts pseudoranges from PRNR via a calibration relying on TDIR; Scheme 2 synchronizes all beatnote signals without TDIR calibration. The schemes rely on newly implemented monitors of local PRNR biases. After the necessary PRNR treatments (unwrapping, ambiguity resolution, bias correction, in-band jitter reduction, and/or calibration), Scheme 1 and 2 achieved ranging accuracies of 2.0 cm to 8.1 cm and 5.8 cm to 41.1 cm, respectively, below the classical 1 m mark with margins.</description>

      <title>The new Herschel/PACS Point Source Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herschel operated as an observatory, therefore it did not cover the whole sky, but still observed ~8% of it. The first version of an overall Herschel/PACS Point Source Catalogue was released in 2017. The data are still unique and are very important for research, especially because no new far-infrared mission is foreseen for at least the next decade. In the framework of the NEMESIS project, we revisited all the photometric observations obtained by the PACS instrument on-board of the Herschel space observatory.
  We aimed to build the most complete and most accurate Herschel/PACS catalogue to date. Our primary goal was to increase the number of real sources, and decrease the number of spurious sources identified on a strongly variable background. Our goal was to build a blind catalogue, meaning that source extraction is conducted without relying on prior detections at various wavelengths, allowing us to detect sources never catalogued before.
  We define a hybrid strategy that includes classical and ML source identification and characterisation methods, providing catalogues at much higher completeness levels than before. Quality assessment also involves ML techniques. Our source extraction methodology facilitates a systematic and impartial comparison of sensitivity levels across various Herschel fields, a task that was typically beyond the scope of individual programs.
  We created a high-reliability and a rejected source catalogue for each PACS passband, i.e., at 70, 100, and 160 {\mu}m. With the high-reliability catalogue, we managed to significantly increase the completeness in all bands. At the same time, while the number of high-reliability detections decreased, the number of sources matching with existing catalogues increased, suggesting that the purity is also higher than before. The photometric accuracy of our pipeline is ~1% based on comparison with the standard star models.</description>

      <title>Detection of Close Kuiper Belt Binaries with HST WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries in the Kuiper Belt are common. Here we present our analysis of the Solar System Origins Legacy Survey (SSOLS) to show that using a PSF-fitting method can roughly double the number of binaries identified in that dataset. Out of 198 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) observed by SSOLS, we find 23 to be visually separated binaries, while a further 19 are blended-PSF binaries detectable with the method we present here. This is an overall binary fraction of 21% for the SSOLS dataset of cold classical KBOs. In addition, we tested our fitting methods on synthetic data, and while we were able to show it to be very effective at detecting certain blended-PSF binary KBOs, fainter or closer binary KBOs may easily be missed, suggesting that the close binary KBO fraction could be even higher. These results strongly support the idea that most (if not all) KBOs were formed through the Streaming Instability process, and as a consequence, most KBOs were formed as near-equal mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Spying on the quickly variable optical sky with the fast optical photometer SiFAP2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of detectors with a high time resolution has been pivotal to our comprehension of neutron stars and the accurate measurement of their properties. While high-time resolution astronomy has become a standard in the radio and the high-/very-high-energy bands, progress in the visible band has been comparatively much slower. SiFAP2 is a high-speed optical photometer mounted at the INAF Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Its potential emerged with the discovery of the first two optical millisecond pulsars: these are among the most efficient particle accelerators and natural laboratories of fundamental physics. Optical millisecond pulsations challenge the standard pulsar paradigm, requiring innovative solutions. Higher photon counting statistics of optical telescopes, compared to high-energy instruments, attain unprecedented sensitivity for weak pulsed signals from bright accreting neutron stars, which are the best candidates for still undetected continuous gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A case study of gas impacted by black-hole jets with the JWST: outflows, bow shocks, and high excitation of the gas in the galaxy IC5063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ~3x2 kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path, and the stability conditions of clouds were known to vary because of these outflows. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is more than 100K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

      <title>RTModel: a platform for real-time modeling and massive analysis of microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microlensing of stars in our Galaxy has long been used to detect and characterize stellar populations, exoplanets, brown dwarfs, stellar remnants and whatever objects may magnify the source stars with their gravitational fields. The interpretation of microlensing light curves is relatively simple for single lenses and single sources but becomes more and more complicated if we add more objects and take their relative motion into account. RTModel is a modeling platform that has been very active in the real-time investigation of microlensing events, providing preliminary models that have proven very useful for driving follow-up resources towards the most interesting events. The success of RTModel is due to the ability to make a thorough and aimed exploration of the parameter space in a relatively short time. This is obtained by three key ideas: the initial conditions are chosen from a template library including all possible caustic crossing and approaches; the fits are performed by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using a bumper mechanism to explore multiple minima; the basic computations of microlensing magnification are performed by the fast and robust VBBinaryLensing package. In this paper we will illustrate all algorithms in RTModel in detail, with the purpose of fostering new ideas in view of future microlensing pipelines aimed at massive microlensing analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) operate by detecting either the electrons or holes created in an ionization event. We propose a new type of imager, the Dual-Sided CCD, which collects and measures both charge carriers on opposite sides of the device via a novel dual-buried channel architecture. We show that this dual detection strategy provides exceptional dark-count rejection and enhanced timing capabilities. These advancements have wide-ranging implications for dark-matter searches, near-IR/optical spectroscopy, and time-domain X-ray astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Detecting Galaxy Tidal Features Using Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low surface brightness substructures around galaxies, known as tidal features, are a valuable tool in the detection of past or ongoing galaxy mergers, and their properties can answer questions about the progenitor galaxies involved in the interactions. The assembly of current tidal feature samples is primarily achieved using visual classification, making it difficult to construct large samples and draw accurate and statistically robust conclusions about the galaxy evolution process. With upcoming large optical imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), predicted to observe billions of galaxies, it is imperative that we refine our methods of detecting and classifying samples of merging galaxies. This paper presents promising results from a self-supervised machine learning model, trained on data from the Ultradeep layer of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, designed to automate the detection of tidal features. We find that self-supervised models are capable of detecting tidal features, and that our model outperforms previous automated tidal feature detection methods, including a fully supervised model. An earlier method applied to real galaxy images achieved 76% completeness for 22% contamination, while our model achieves considerably higher (96%) completeness for the same level of contamination. We emphasise a number of advantages of self-supervised models over fully supervised models including maintaining excellent performance when using only 50 labelled examples for training, and the ability to perform similarity searches using a single example of a galaxy with tidal features.</description>

      <title>TESLA-X: An effective method to search for sub-threshold lensed gravitational waves with a targeted population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can produce copies of gravitational-wave signals from the same source with the same waveform morphologies but different amplitudes and arrival times. Some of these strongly-lensed gravitational-wave signals can be demagnified and become sub-threshold. We present TESLA-X, an enhanced approach to the original GstLAL-based TargetEd Subthreshold Lensing seArch (TESLA) method, for improving the detection efficiency of these potential sub-threshold lensed signals. TESLA-X utilizes lensed injections to generate a targeted population model and a targeted template bank. We compare the performance of a full template bank search, TESLA, and TESLA-X methods via a simulation campaign, and demonstrate the performance of TESLA-X in recovering lensed injections, particularly targeting a mock event. Our results show that the TESLA-X method achieves a maximum of $\sim 10\%$ higher search sensitivity compared to the TESLA method within the sub-threshold regime, presenting a step towards detecting the first lensed gravitational wave. TESLA-X will be employed for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's collaboration-wide analysis to search for lensing signatures in the fourth observing run.</description>

Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magnetorotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron star birth properties and their dynamical and magnetorotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from lognormal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic field decay with a power law. Each lognormal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and we produce a large database of synthetic $P$--$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magnetorotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the lognormal distributions and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at the $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step toward robust statistical inference for complex population synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multiwavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>FREmu: Power Spectrum Emulator for $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

Abstract: To investigate gravity in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from Stage-IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as non-linear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of non-linear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of non-linear power spectra specifically for the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model across scales $0.0089 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}&lt;k&lt;0.5 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;3$. FREmu leverages Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing 7 dimensions, including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_{\nu}$ and $f_{R_0}$, the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>

Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>
