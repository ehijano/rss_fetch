      <title>Heating in the Solar Atmosphere at a Fin Current Sheet Driven by Magnetic Flux Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection before flux cancellation in the solar photosphere when two opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fragments are approaching one another is usually modelled by assuming that a small so-called "floating current sheet" forms about a null point or separator that is situated in the overlying atmosphere. Here instead we consider the reconnection that is initiated as soon as the fragments become close enough that their magnetic fields interact. The resulting current sheet, which we term a "fin sheet" extends up from the null point or separator that is initially located in the solar surface. We develop here nonlinear analyses for finite-length models of both fin and floating current sheets that extend the previous models that were limited to short floating current sheets. These enable the length of the current sheet to be calculated in both cases as functions of the separation distance of the sources and the reconnection rate, as well as the rate of heating. Usually, the fin current sheet liberates more energy than a floating current sheet.</description>

      <title>Advection-nonlinear-diffusion model of flare accelerated electron transport in Type III solar radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams travelling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax towards a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok's dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. The model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with nonlinear diffusion term that inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast propagating electron beam. The model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.</description>
