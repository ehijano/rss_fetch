      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for incommensurate antiferromagnetism in nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection between nonsymmorphic symmetry and electronic correlations has emerged as a platform for topological Kondo semimetallic states and unconventional spin textures. Here we report the synthesis of nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ single crystals and their structural, electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties. UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) below $T_N\simeq$ 161 K as evidenced by a sharp cusp in magnetic susceptibility, a second-order phase transition in specific heat, and an upturn in electrical resistivity, which suggests an incommensurate AFM structure that deviates from the A-type magnetism typically observed in this class of materials. Across $T_N$, Hall effect measurements reveal a change from electron-dominated to hole-dominated transport, which points to a sharp reconstruction in the electronic structure at $T_N$. Upon further cooling, a first-order transition is observed at $T_1 \simeq 30 $K in magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity but not in electrical resistivity or Hall measurements, which indicates a small change in the AFM structure that does not affect the electronic structure. Our specific heat data reveal a small Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma \simeq$13 mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$), consistent with localized 5$f$ electrons. Our results indicate that UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ hosts weak electronic correlations and is likely away from a Kondo semimetallic state. Low-temperature magnetization measurements show that the AFM structure is remarkably stable to 160 kOe and does not undergo any field-induced transitions. Neutron diffraction and magnetization experiments at higher fields would be valuable to probe the presence of unconventional spin textures.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamic Evolution of Interfaces between Polymer Solutions and Gels and Polymer Interdiffusion: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Letting free polymers diffuse from solution into a crosslinked polymer gel is often a crucial processing step in the synthesis of multiphase polymer-based gels, e.g., core-shell microgels. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to obtain molecular insights into this process. We consider idealized situations where the gel is modeled as a regular polymer network with the topology of a diamond lattice, and all free polymers and strands have the same length and consist of the same type of monomer. After bringing the gel and the polymer solution into contact, two time regimes are observed: An initial compression of the gel caused by the osmotic pressure of the solution, followed by an expansion due to swelling. We characterize the time evolution of density profiles, the penetration of free polymers into the gel and the connection between the gel and solution phase. The interfacial structure locally equilibrates after roughly 100 chain relaxation times. At late times, the free chains inside the gel undergo a percolation transition if the polymer concentration in the gel exceeds a critical value, which is of the same order as the overlap concentration. The fluctuations of the interface can be described by a capillary wave model that accounts for the elasticity of the gel. Based on this, we extract the interfacial tension of the gel-solution interface. Interestingly, both the interfacial tension and the local interfacial width increase with increasing free polymer concentration - in contrast to liquid-liquid interfaces, where these two quantities are typically anticorrelated.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a physically motivated loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure effectively captures the relevant dynamical frequencies in the time evolution and is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics. We showcase the method's effectiveness by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D. By extracting the asymptotic long-time evolution, we uncover signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, the method presented here shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches and highlight the potential to explore previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Uniform response theory of non-Hermitian systems: Non-Hermitian physics beyond the exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display remarkable response effects that reflect a variety of distinct spectral scenarios, such as exceptional points where the eigensystem becomes defective. However, present frameworks treat the different scenarios as separate cases, following the singular mathematical change between the spectral decompositions from one scenario to another. This not only complicates the coherent description near the spectral singularities where the response qualitatively changes, but also impedes the application to practical systems. Here we develop a general response theory of non-Hermitian systems that uniformly applies across all spectral scenarios. We unravel this response by formulating uniform expansions of the spectral quantization condition and Green's function, where both expansions exclusively involve directly calculable data from the Hamiltonian. This data smoothly varies with external parameters as spectral singularities are approached, and nevertheless captures the qualitative differences of the response in these scenarios. We furthermore present two direct applications of this framework. Firstly, we determine the precise conditions for spectral degeneracies of geometric multiplicity greater than unity, as well as the perturbative behavior around these cases. Secondly, we formulate a hierarchy of spectral response strengths that varies continuously across all parameter space, and thereby also reliably determines the response strength of exceptional points. Finally, we demonstrate both generally and in concrete examples that the previously inaccessible scenarios of higher geometric multiplicity result in unique variants of super-Lorentzian response. Our approach widens the scope of non-Hermitian response theory to capture all spectral scenarios on an equal and uniform footing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Long-Range Interactions in Mesoscopic Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>
