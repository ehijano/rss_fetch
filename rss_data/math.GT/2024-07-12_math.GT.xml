      <title>The sphere complex of a locally finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally finite graph $\Gamma$, we consider its mapping class group $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ as defined by Algom-Kfir-Bestvina. For these groups, we prove a generalization of the results of Laudenbach and Brendle-Broaddus-Putman, producing a $3$-manifold $M_{\Gamma}$ whose mapping class group surjects onto $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ with kernel a compact abelian group of sphere twists so that the corresponding short exact sequence splits. Along the way we obtain an induced faithful action of $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ on the sphere complex $\mathcal{S}(M_{\Gamma})$ of $M_{\Gamma}$, which is the simplicial complex whose simplices are isotopy classes of finite collections of spheres in $M_{\Gamma}$ which are pairwise disjoint. When $\Gamma$ has finite rank, we further show that the action of $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ on a certain natural subcomplex has elements with positive translation length, and also consider a candidate for an Outer space of such a graph. As another application, we prove that for many $\Gamma$, $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ is quasi-isometric to a particular subgraph of $\mathcal{S}(M_{\Gamma})$, following Schaffer-Cohen. We also deduce analogs of the results of Domat-Hoganson-Kwak.</description>

      <title>On the degree-two part of the associated graded of the lower central series of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the associated graded $\bigoplus_{k\geq 1} \Gamma_k \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_{k+1} \mathcal{I} $ of the lower central series $\mathcal{I} = \Gamma_1 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I} \supset \cdots$ of the Torelli group $\mathcal{I}$ of a compact oriented surface. Its degree-one part is well-understood by D. Johnson's seminal works on the abelianization of the Torelli group. The knowledge of the degree-two part $(\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I})\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ with rational coefficients arises from works of S. Morita on the Casson invariant and R. Hain on the Malcev completion of $\mathcal{I}$. Here, we prove that the abelian group $\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is torsion-free, and we describe it as a lattice in a rational vector space. As an application, the group $\mathcal{I}/\Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is computed, and it is shown to embed in the group of homology cylinders modulo the surgery relation of $Y_3$-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Generic Properties of Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split real form of a complex simple adjoint group and let $S$ be a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2. We show that for generic $\operatorname{PSL}_{2k-1}(\mathbb{R})$-Hitchin representations $\rho$, the middle eigenvalue of $\rho(x)$ is not equal to 1 for all non-trivial elements $x\in \pi_1(S)$. Using the same technique, we prove that the set of strongly dense $G$-Hitchin representations is generic. This generalizes the result of Long, Reid and Wolff for the $G=\operatorname{PSL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ case.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in Euclidean isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the geometry of conjugation within any split subgroup $H$ of the full isometry group $G$ of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that for any $h \in H$, the conjugacy class $[h]_H$ of $h$ is described geometrically by the move-set of its linearization, while the set of elements conjugating $h$ to a given $h'\in [h]_H$ is described by the the fix-set of its linearization. Examples include all affine Coxeter groups, certain crystallographic groups, and the group $G$ itself.</description>

      <title>The prescribed metric on the boundary of convex subsets of anti-de Sitter space with a quasi-circle as ideal boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ be two complete, conformal metrics on the disc $\mathbb{D}$. Assume moreover that the derivatives of the conformal factors of the metrics $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ are bounded at any order with respect to the hyperbolic metric, and that the metrics have curvatures in the interval $\left(-\frac{1}{\epsilon}, -1 - \epsilon\right)$, for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Let $f$ be a quasi-symmetric map. We show the existence of a globally hyperbolic convex subset $\Omega$ (see Definition 3.1) of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, such that $\Omega$ has $h^{+}$ (respectively $h^{-}$) as the induced metric on its future boundary (respectively on its past boundary) and has a gluing map $\Phi_{\Omega}$ (see Definition 4.5) equal to $f$.</description>

      <title>Convergences of Combinatorial Ricci Flows to Degenerated Circle Packings in Hyperbolic Background Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a kind of degenerated circle packings in hyperbolic background geometry. A main problem is whether a prescribed total geodesic curvature data can be realized by a degenerated circle packing or not. We fully characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions and show the uniqueness. Furthermore, we introduce the combinatoral Ricci flow to find the desired degenerated circle packed surface, analougus to the methods of Chow-Luo and Takatsu.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of the HOMFLY polynomial for bipartite knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

      <title>Atypical values at infinity of real polynomial maps with $2$-dimensional fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial function of three variables by a certain sum of indices of the gradient vector field of the function restricted to a sphere with a sufficiently large radius. This is an analogy of a result of Coste and de la Puente for real polynomial functions with two variables. We also give a characterization of atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial map whose regular fibers are $2$-dimensional surfaces.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
