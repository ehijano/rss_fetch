      <title>A Parameterized Perspective on Uniquely Restricted Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph G, a matching is a subset of edges of G that do not share an endpoint. A matching M is uniquely restricted if the subgraph induced by the endpoints of the edges of M has exactly one perfect matching. Given a graph G and a positive integer \ell, Uniquely Restricted Matching asks whether G has a uniquely restricted matching of size at least \ell. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of Uniquely Restricted Matching under various parameters. Specifically, we show that Uniquely Restricted Matching admits a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm on line graphs when parameterized by the solution size. We also establish that the problem is FPT when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. Furthermore, we show that Uniquely Restricted Matching does not admit a polynomial kernel with respect to the vertex cover number plus the size of the matching unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>A Polylogarithmic Algorithm for Stochastic Online Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the \emph{Online Sorting Problem}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At each time step $t$, a real number $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed immediately and irrevocably into an empty cell. The objective is to minimize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive entries. The problem was introduced by Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist (SODA 2023) as a technical tool for proving lower bounds in online geometric packing problems. In follow-up work, Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen, and Kozma (ESA 2024) studied the \emph{Stochastic Online Sorting Problem}, where each $x_t$ is drawn i.i.d.\ from $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, and presented a $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$-competitive algorithm, showing that stochastic input enables much stronger guarantees than in the adversarial setting. They also introduced the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)} as a multidimensional generalization. More recently, Hu, independently and in parallel, obtained a $\log n \cdot 2^{O(\log^* n)}$-competitive algorithm together with a logarithmic lower bound for the \emph{Stochastic Online Sorting Problem}.
  We give an $O(\log^{2} n)$-competitive algorithm for the \emph{Stochastic Online Sorting Problem} that succeeds w.h.p., achieving an exponential improvement over the $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ bound of Abrahamsen et al.(ESA 2024). Our approach further extends to the \emph{Stochastic Online TSP} in fixed dimension $d$, where it achieves an $O(\log^2 n)$-competitive ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T [1..n]$ be a text over an alphabet of size $\sigma \in \mathrm{polylog} (n)$, let $r^*$ be the sum of the numbers of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler Transforms of $T$ and its reverse, and let $z$ be the number of phrases in the LZ77 parse of $T$. We show how to store $T$ in $O (r^* \log (n / r^*) + z \log n)$ bits such that, given a pattern $P [1..m]$, we can report the locations of the $\mathrm{occ}$ occurrences of $P$ in $T$ in $O (m \log n + \mathrm{occ} \log^\epsilon n)$ time. We can also report the position of the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of $P$ in $T$ in the same space and $O (m \log^\epsilon n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Weighted Partition Vertex and Edge Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalizations of the classical Vertex Cover and Edge Cover problems that incorporate group-wise coverage constraints. Our first focus is the \emph{Weighted Prize-Collecting Partition Vertex Cover} (WP-PVC) problem: given a graph with weights on both vertices and edges, and a partition of the edge set into $\omega$ groups, the goal is to select a minimum-weight subset of vertices such that, in each group, the total weight (profit) of covered edges meets a specified threshold. This formulation generalizes classical vertex cover, partial vertex cover and partition vertex cover.
  We present two algorithms for WP-PVC. The first is a simple 2-approximation that solves \( n^{\omega} \) LP's, improving over prior work by Bandyapadhyay et al.\ by removing an enumerative step and the extra \( \epsilon \)-factor in approximation, while also extending to the weighted setting. The second is a bi-criteria algorithm that applies when \( \omega \) is large, approximately meeting profit targets with a bounded LP-relative cost.
  We also study a natural generalization of the edge cover problem, the \emph{Weighted Partition Edge Cover} (W-PEC) problem, where each edge has an associated weights, and the vertex set is partitioned into groups. For each group, the goal is to cover at least a specified number of vertices using incident edges, while minimizing the total weight of the selected edges. We present the first exact polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted case, improving runtime from \( O(\omega n^3) \) to \( O(mn+n^2 \log n) \) and simplifying the algorithmic structure over prior unweighted approaches. We also show that the prize-collecting variant of the W-PEC problem is NP-Complete via a reduction from the knapsack problem.</description>

      <title>A simple analysis of a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving low-rank linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a simple algorithm for sampling from the solution $\mathbf{x}^* := \mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{b}$ to a linear system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. We assume access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared row/column-norms of $\mathbf{A}$. Our algorithm produces a compressed representation of some vector $\mathbf{x}$ for which $\|\mathbf{x}^* - \mathbf{x}\| &lt; \varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}^* \|$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ time, where $\kappa_{\mathsf{F}} := \|\mathbf{A}\|_{\mathsf{F}}\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$ and $\kappa := \|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$. The representation of $\mathbf{x}$ allows us to query entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^2)$ time and sample proportional to the square entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^6)$ time, assuming access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared entries of any given row of $\mathbf{A}$. Our analysis, which is elementary, non-asymptotic, and fully self-contained, simplifies and clarifies several past analyses from literature including [Gily\'en, Song, and Tang; 2022, 2023] and [Shao and Montanaro; 2022].</description>

      <title>Discovering Expert-Level Nash Equilibrium Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm design and analysis is a cornerstone of computer science, but it confronts a major challenge. Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria. LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could alone.</description>

      <title>Computing Approximately Proportional Allocations of Indivisible Goods: Beyond Additive and Monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although approximate notions of envy-freeness-such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1)-have been extensively studied for indivisible goods, the seemingly simpler fairness concept of proportionality up to one good (PROP1) has received far less attention. For additive valuations, every EF1 allocation is PROP1, and well-known algorithms such as Round-Robin and Envy-Cycle Elimination compute such allocations in polynomial time. PROP1 is also compatible with Pareto efficiency, as maximum Nash welfare allocations are EF1 and hence PROP1.
  We ask whether these favorable properties extend to non-additive valuations. We study a broad class of allocation instances with {\em satiating goods}, where agents have non-negative valuation functions that need not be monotone, allowing for negative marginal values. We present the following results:
  - EF1 implies PROP1 for submodular valuations over satiating goods, ensuring existence and efficient computation via Envy-Cycle Elimination for monotone submodular valuations;
  - Round-robin computes a partial PROP1 allocation after the second-to-last round for satiating submodular goods and a complete PROP1 for monotone submodular valuations;
  - PROP1 allocations for satiating subadditive goods can be computed in polynomial-time;
  - Maximum Nash welfare allocations are PROP1 for monotone submodular goods, revealing yet another facet of their ``unreasonable fairness.''</description>

      <title>jXBW: Fast Substructure Search in Large-Scale JSONL Datasets for Foundation Model Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substructure search in JSON Lines (JSONL) datasets is essential for modern applications such as prompt engineering in foundation models, but existing methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to exhaustive tree traversal and subtree matching. We present jXBW, a fast method for substructure search on large-scale JSONL datasets. Our method makes three key technical contributions: (i) a merged tree representation built by merging trees of multiple JSON objects while preserving individual identities, (ii) a succinct data structure based on the eXtended Burrows-Wheeler Transform that enables efficient tree navigation and subpath search, and (iii) an efficient three-step substructure search algorithm that combines path decomposition, ancestor computation, and adaptive tree identifier collection to ensure correctness while avoiding exhaustive tree traversal. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that jXBW consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving speedups of 16$\times$ for smaller datasets and up to 4,700$\times$ for larger datasets over tree-based approaches, and more than 6$\times$10$^6$ over XML-based processing while maintaining competitive memory usage.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Improvements to List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes are a well-studied family of codes, known for achieving list decoding capacity. In this work, we give improved deterministic and randomized algorithms for list decoding FRS codes of rate $R$ up to radius $1-R-\varepsilon$.
  We present a deterministic decoder that runs in near-linear time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$, improving upon the best-known runtime $n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$ for decoding FRS codes. Prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose deterministic decoding could be done in time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$.
  We also present a randomized decoder that runs in fully polynomial time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$, improving the best-known runtime $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)\cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$ for decoding FRS codes. Again, prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose decoding time depended polynomially on $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Group Fair Matchings using Convex Cost Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning items to platforms where each item has a utility associated with each of the platforms to which it can be assigned. Each platform has a soft constraint over the total number of items it serves, modeled via a convex cost function. Additionally, items are partitioned into groups, and each platform also incurs group-specific convex cost over the number of items from each group that can be assigned to the platform. These costs promote group fairness by penalizing imbalances, yielding a soft variation of fairness notions introduced in prior work, such as Restricted Dominance and Minority protection. Restricted Dominance enforces upper bounds on group representation, while Minority protection enforces lower bounds. Our approach replaces such hard constraints with cost-based penalties, allowing more flexible trade-offs. Our model also captures Nash Social Welfare kind of objective.
  The cost of an assignment is the sum of the values of all the cost functions across all the groups and platforms. The objective is to find an assignment that minimizes the cost while achieving a total utility that is at least a user-specified threshold. The main challenge lies in balancing the overall platform cost with group-specific costs, both governed by convex functions, while meeting the utility constraint. We present an efficient polynomial-time approximation algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation. Our algorithm is based on techniques involving linear programming and network flows. We also provide an exact algorithm for a special case with uniform utilities and establish the hardness of the general problem when the groups can intersect arbitrarily.</description>

      <title>On computing and the complexity of computing higher-order $U$-statistics, exactly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order $U$-statistics abound in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and computer science, but are known to be highly time-consuming to compute in practice. Despite their widespread appearance, a comprehensive study of their computational complexity is surprisingly lacking. This paper aims to fill that gap by presenting several results related to the computational aspect of $U$-statistics. First, we derive a useful decomposition from an $m$-th order $U$-statistic to a linear combination of $V$-statistics with orders not exceeding $m$, which are generally more feasible to compute. Second, we explore the connection between exactly computing $V$-statistics and Einstein summation, a tool often used in computational mathematics, quantum computing, and quantum information sciences for accelerating tensor computations. Third, we provide an optimistic estimate of the time complexity for exactly computing $U$-statistics, based on the treewidth of a particular graph associated with the $U$-statistic kernel. The above ingredients lead to a new, much more runtime-efficient algorithm of exactly computing general higher-order $U$-statistics. We also wrap our new algorithm into an open-source Python package called $\texttt{u-stats}$. We demonstrate via three statistical applications that $\texttt{u-stats}$ achieves impressive runtime performance compared to existing benchmarks. This paper aspires to achieve two goals: (1) to capture the interest of researchers in both statistics and other related areas further to advance the algorithmic development of $U$-statistics, and (2) to offer the package $\texttt{u-stats}$ as a valuable tool for practitioners, making the implementation of methods based on higher-order $U$-statistics a more delightful experience.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Congested Clique Counting for Local Gibbs Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are well established reductions between combinatorial sampling and counting problems (Jerrum, Valiant, Vazirani TCS 1986). Building off of a very recent parallel algorithm utilizing this connection (Liu, Yin, Zhang arxiv 2024), we demonstrate the first approximate counting algorithm in the CongestedClique for a wide range of problems. Most interestingly, we present an algorithm for approximating the number of $q$-colorings of a graph within $\epsilon$-multiplicative error, when $q&gt;\alpha\Delta$ for any constant $\alpha&gt;2$, in $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{n^{1/3}}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ rounds. More generally, we achieve a runtime of $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{n^{1/3}}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ rounds for approximating the partition function of Gibbs distributions defined over graphs when simple locality and fast mixing conditions hold. Gibbs distributions are widely used in fields such as machine learning and statistical physics. We obtain our result by providing an algorithm to draw $n$ random samples from a distributed Markov chain in parallel, using similar ideas to triangle counting (Dolev, Lenzen, Peled DISC 2012) and semiring matrix multiplication (Censor-Hillel, Kaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela PODC 2015). Aside from counting problems, this result may be interesting for other applications requiring a large number of samples. In the special case of estimating the partition function of the hardcore model, also known as counting weighted independent sets, we can do even better and achieve an $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ round algorithm, when the fugacity $\lambda \leq \frac{\alpha}{\Delta-1}$, where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant less than $1$.</description>

      <title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower) distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal, achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of recovering the latent vertex correspondence between two correlated random graphs with vastly inhomogeneous and unknown edge probabilities between different pairs of vertices. Inspired by and extending the matching algorithm via degree profiles by Ding, Ma, Wu and Xu (2021), we obtain an efficient matching algorithm as long as the minimal average degree is at least $\Omega(\log^{2} n)$ and the minimal correlation is at least $1 - O(\log^{-2} n)$.</description>

      <title>Rapid Exploration of Assembly Chemical Space of Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying how hard it is to build a molecular graph matters for biosignature detection, chemical complexity, and cheminformatics. We present an exact, scalable algorithm to compute the molecular assembly index (MA) which prioritizes the largest duplicate subgraphs, represents fragmentation with an 'assembly state' array of edge-lists, reuses states via hashing/DAGs, and prunes the search using a dynamic-programming branch-and-bound guided by a conditional-addition-chain lower bound. For organic molecules in the greater than 500 Da range our approach is up to six orders of magnitude faster than prior methods and yields exact MAs where previous algorithms would have timed out. We compute MAs to convergence for ~300k COCONUT natural products with &lt;50 bonds, profiling time and memory scaling. Finally, we exploit the speed of our algorithm to calculate joint assembly spaces and introduce the Joint Assembly Overlap (JAO), a Jaccard-like metric that emphasizes global scaffold reuse and show that the JAO yields substantially different rankings from Tanimoto similarity with ECFP fingerprints and MCS (e.g. in steroids 270-380/Da and short peptides), accounting for substructural similarity beyond local environments. Together, these advances turn the molecular assembly index into a practical tool for large-scale exploration of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Matrix-by-matrix multiplication algorithm with $O(N^2log_2N)$ computational complexity for variable precision arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that assuming the availability of the processor with variable precision arithmetic, we can compute matrix-by-matrix multiplications in $O(N^2log_2N)$ computational complexity. We replace the standard matrix-by-matrix multiplications $\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} &amp; B_{12} \\ B_{21} &amp; B_{22}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} A_{11}B_{11}+A_{12}B_{21} &amp; A_{11}B_{12}+A_{12}B_{22} \\ A_{21}B_{11}+A_{22}B_{21} &amp; A_{21}B_{12}+A_{22}B_{22}\end{bmatrix}$ by $\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} &amp; B_{12} \\ B_{21} &amp; B_{22}\end{bmatrix}=\Bigl\lfloor\begin{bmatrix} (A_{11}+\epsilon A_{12})(B_{11}+1/{\epsilon}B_{21}) &amp; (A_{11}+\epsilon A_{12})(B_{12}+1/{\epsilon}B_{22}) \\ (A_{21}+\epsilon A_{22})(B_{11}+1/{\epsilon}B_{21}) &amp;(A_{21}+\epsilon A_{22})(B_{12}+1/{\epsilon}B_{22})\end{bmatrix} \Bigr\rfloor \% \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ where $\lfloor \rfloor$ denotes the floor, and $\%$ denotes the modulo operators. We reduce the number of block matrix-by-matrix multiplications from 8 to 4, keeping the number of additions equal to 4, and additionally introducing 4 multiplications of a block matrices by $\epsilon$ or $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, and 4 floor and 4 modulo operations. The resulting computational complexity for two matrices of size $N\times N$ can be estimated from recursive equation $T(N)=4(N/2)^2$ (multiplication of a matrix by $\epsilon$ and $1/\epsilon$) plus $4(N/2)^2$ (additions of two matrices) plus $2N^2$ (floor and modulo) plus $4T(N/2)$ (four recursive calls) as $O(N^2log_2N)$. These multiplications of blocks of a matrix by number scales like $O((N/2)^2)$. We also present a MATLAB code using \emph{vpa} variable precision arithmetic emulator that can multiply matrices of size $N\times N$ using $(4log_2N+1)N^2$ vpa operations. This emulator uses $O(N)$ digits to run our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Gossip Algorithms for Approximate Quantile and Mean Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents gossip algorithms for aggregation tasks that demonstrate both robustness to adversarial corruptions of any order of magnitude and optimality across a substantial range of these corruption levels. Gossip algorithms distribute information in a scalable and efficient way by having random pairs of nodes exchange small messages. Value aggregation problems are of particular interest in this setting, as they occur frequently in practice, and many elegant algorithms have been proposed for computing aggregates and statistics such as averages and quantiles. An important and well-studied advantage of gossip algorithms is their robustness to message delays, network churn, and unreliable message transmissions. However, these crucial robustness guarantees only hold if all nodes follow the protocol and no messages are corrupted. In this paper, we remedy this by providing a framework to model both adversarial participants and message corruptions in gossip-style communications by allowing an adversary to control a small fraction of the nodes or corrupt messages arbitrarily. Despite this very powerful and general corruption model, we show that robust gossip algorithms can be designed for many important aggregation problems. Our algorithms guarantee that almost all nodes converge to an approximately correct answer with optimal efficiency and essentially as fast as without corruptions. The design of adversarially-robust gossip algorithms poses completely new challenges. Despite this, our algorithms remain very simple variations of known non-robust algorithms with often only subtle changes to avoid non-compliant nodes gaining too much influence over outcomes. While our algorithms remain simple, their analysis is much more complex and often requires a completely different approach than the non-adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>A framework for boosting matching approximation: parallel, distributed, and dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work designs a framework for boosting the approximation guarantee of maximum matching algorithms. As input, the framework receives a parameter $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and an oracle access to a $\Theta(1)$-approximate maximum matching algorithm $\mathcal{A}$. Then, by invoking $\mathcal{A}$ for $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ many times, the framework outputs a $1+\epsilon$ approximation of a maximum matching. Our approach yields several improvements in terms of the number of invocations to $\mathcal{A}$:
  (1) In MPC and CONGEST, our framework invokes $\mathcal{A}$ for $O(1/\epsilon^7 \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$ times, substantially improving on $O(1/\epsilon^{39})$ invocations following from [Fischer et al., STOC'22] and [Mitrovic et al., arXiv:2412.19057].
  (2) In both online and offline fully dynamic settings, our framework yields an improvement in the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ from exponential [Assadi et al., SODA25 and Liu, FOCS24] to polynomial.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized polymatroids. This implies $\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form $\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight (2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and upper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular ASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Online Learning with Probing for Sequential User-Centric Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.</description>

      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard in the standard protocol-tree model, answering, independently and concurrently with Hirahara-Llango-Loff (arXiv:2507.10426), a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2411.19003); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols for self-similar constructions with strong structural properties, giving a flexible framework for the design of reductions showing NP-hardness of deciding the communication complexity of a Boolean matrix. This complements the work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff, which establishes NP-hardness in the same model via a different route; our analysis additionally yields reusable structural guarantees and underpins further consequences concerning inapproximability.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound. Furthermore we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>
