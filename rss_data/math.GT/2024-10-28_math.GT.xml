      <title>Simplicial volume and isolated, closed totally geodesic submanifolds of codimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any closed Riemannian manifold with dimension at least two and with nonpositive curvature, if it admits an isolated, closed totally geodesic submanifold of codimension one, then its simplicial volume is positive. As a direct corollary of this, for any nonpositively curved analytic manifold with dimension at least three, if its universal cover admits a codimension one flat, then either it has non-trivial Euclidean de Rham factors, or it has positive simplicial volume.</description>

      <title>The knot meridians of (1,1)-knot complements are CTF-detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any (1,1)-knot in a lens space, we construct a co-oriented taut foliation in its complement that intersects the boundary torus transversely in a suspension foliation of the knot meridian, or the infinity slope. This provides new evidence for a conjecture made by Boyer, Gordon and Hu using slope detections, related to the L-space conjecture.</description>

      <title>An Excision Theorem in Heegaard Floer Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y_1$ be a closed, oriented 3-manifold and $\Sigma$ denote a non-separating closed, orientable surface in $Y_1$ which consists of two connected components of the same genus. By cutting $Y_1$ along $\Sigma$ and re-gluing it using an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of $\Sigma$ we obtain another closed, oriented 3-manifold $Y_2$. When the excision surface $\Sigma$ is of genus one, we show that twisted Heegaard Floer homology groups of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ (twisted with coefficients in the universal Novikov ring) are isomorphic. We use this excision theorem to demonstrate that certain manifolds are not related by the excision construction on a genus one surface. Additionally, we apply the excision formula to compute twisted Heegaard Floer homology groups of 0-surgery on certain two-component links, including some families of 2-bridge links.</description>

      <title>On the n-loop Kontsevich invariant of knots having the same Alexander polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-loop Kontsevich invariant of knots takes its value in the completion of the space of $n$-loop open Jacobi diagrams, which is an infinite dimensional vector space. Since the 1-loop part is presented by the Alexander polynomial, we are interested in the image of the $\geq 2$-loop Kontsevich invariant of knots having the same Alexander polynomial. In this paper, we show that for $n\geq 2$ the subspace generated by the image of the $n$-loop Kontsevich invariant of genus $\leq g$ knots having the same Alexander polynomial is finite dimensional. Further, we give some concrete calculations about those subspaces and dimensions in several simple cases.</description>

      <title>On the Volume Conjecture for hyperbolic Dehn-filled 3-manifolds along the twist knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a twist knot $\mathcal{K}_{p'}$, let $M$ be the closed $3$-manifold obtained by doing $(p, q)$ Dehn-filling along $\mathcal{K}_{p'}$. In this article, we prove that Chen-Yang's volume conjecture holds for sufficiently large $|p| + |q|$ and $|p'|$ for $M$. In the proof, we construct a new ideal triangulation of the Whitehead link complement which is different from Thurston's triangulation. Our triangulation has led to some new discoveries regarding symmetry, including insights into ``sister manifolds'' as introduced by Hodgson, Meyerhoff, and Weeks.</description>

      <title>Surfaces proper homotopy equivalent to graphs and their Dehn-Nielsen-Baer maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Algom-Kfir and Bestinva introducing the mapping class group of an infinite graph via proper homotopy equivalences, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface to be properly homotopy equivalent to a graph. We consider second-countable orientable surfaces that are possibly infinite-type and have noncompact boundary. For surfaces proper homotopy equivalent to graphs, we explore the basic properties of the induced map between the mapping class groups of the surface and the graph. We view this induced map as the basis of a Dehn-Nielsen-Baer analog in the setting of infinite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Summability for State Integrals of hyperbolic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove conjectures of Garoufalidis-Gu-Mari\~no that perturbative series associated with the hyperbolic knots $4_1$ and $5_2$ are resurgent and Borel summable. In the process, we give an algorithm that can be used to explicitly compute the Borel-Laplace resummation as a combination of state integrals of Andersen-Kashaev. This gives a complete description of the resurgent structure in these examples and allows for explicit computations of Stokes constants.</description>

      <title>Filtered instanton homology and cosmetic surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmetic surgery conjecture predicts that for a non-trivial knot in the three-sphere, performing two different Dehn surgeries results in distinct oriented three-manifolds. Hanselman reduced the problem to $\pm 2$ or $\pm 1/n$-surgeries being the only possible cosmetic surgeries. We remove the case of $\pm 1/n$-surgeries using the Chern-Simons filtration on Floer's original irreducible-only instanton homology, reducing the conjecture to the case of $\pm 2$-surgery on genus $2$ knots with trivial Alexander polynomial. Along the way, we establish a new surgery relationship for Floer's instanton homology and prove some similar results for surgeries on knots in $S^2 \times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Singularities of helicoidal surfaces of frontals in the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate helicoidal (screw) surfaces generated not only by regular curves but also by curves with singular points. For curves with singular points, it is useful to use frontals in the Euclidean plane. The helicoidal surface of a frontal can naturally be considered as a generalised framed base surface. Moreover, we show that it is also a framed base surface under a mild condition. We give basic invariants and curvatures for helicoidal surfaces of frontals by using the curvatures of Legendre curves. Moreover, we also give criteria for singularities of helicoidal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Finite quotients of Fuchsian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an effective algorithm for distinguishing finite quotients between two non-isomorphic finitely generated Fuchsian groups $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$. It will suffice to take a finite quotient which is abelian, dihedral, a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbf{F}_q)$, or an abelian extension of one of these 3. We will develop an approach for creating group extensions upon a shared finite quotient of $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ which between them have differing degrees of smoothness. Regarding the order of a finite quotient that distinguishes between $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$, we establish an upperbound as a function of the genera, the number of punctures, and the cone orders arising in $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>$A_\infty$ Sabloff Duality via the LSFT Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Ng's LSFT algebra to upgrade Sabloff duality of Legendrian knots to a quasi-isomorphism of $A_\infty$ bimodules over the positive augmentation category $\mathcal{A}ug_+$. We also extend the Ekholm-Etnyre-Sabloff exact sequence to an exact sequence of $\mathcal{A}ug_+$-bimodules, using a quotient category $\mathcal{C}$ of short Reeb chords. In addition, we define curved augmentations of the LSFT algebra and show that they can be used to construct a homotopy inverse of the $A_\infty$ Sabloff map, together with all higher homotopies. The above results suggest a conjectural recipe for an explicit weak relative Calabi-Yau structure on the quotient $A_\infty$ functor $\pi:\mathcal{A}ug_+\to \mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between regular and decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms in $4$-dimensional symplectizations. First, we show that regular sliceness implies once-stably decomposable sliceness, and offer a stabilization-free strategy. On the other hand, we show that satelliting preserves regularity of concordance, suggesting that regularity and decomposability are distinct in general. Among other results, we compare the symplectic and smooth slice-ribbon conjectures and construct decomposably slice knots that may not be strongly decomposably slice.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a finite balanced presentation $P$. We associate a Heegaard Floer homology group $\widehat{HF}_P(G)$ with the pair $(G,P)$ based on some extra choices and technical assumptions. We show that $\widehat{HF}_P(G)$ is independent from these choices and also is invariant under stable Andrews-Curtis transformations on $P$, based on two claims which are not settled in this paper.</description>

The abstract characterization also gives a relationship between our algebra and the wrapped Fukaya category of the torus. These algebras underpin the (unspecialized) bordered Heegaard Floer homology for three-manifolds with torus boundary, which will be constructed in forthcoming work.</description>

Abstract: In 2015, Borodzik, N\'emethi and Ranicki proved that an interior critical point can be pushed to the boundary, where it splits into two boundary critical points.

That is, we reverse the original construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new homotopy invariant of metric spaces, called the distributional LS-category, was defined, which provides a lower bound to the classical LS-category. In this paper, we obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of a closed manifold to be maximum, i.e., equal to its classical LS-category (cat). These give us many new computations of dcat, especially for some essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the cat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Whitehead Doubles and Non-Orientable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whitehead doubles provide a plethora of examples of knots that are topologically slice but not smoothly slice. We discuss the problem of the Whitehead double of the Figure 8 knot and survey commonly used techniques to obstructing sliceness. Additionally, we improve bounds in general for the non-orientable 4 genus of $t$-twisted Whitehead doubles and provide genus 1 non-orientable cobordisms to cable knots.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Forms, Price Inequalities, and Benjamini-Schramm Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.05634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Betti numbers of sequences of Riemannian manifolds which Benjamini-Schramm converge to their universal covers. Using the Price inequalities we developed elsewhere, we derive two distinct convergence results. First, under a negative Ricci curvature assumption and no assumption on sign of the sectional curvature, we have a convergence result for weakly uniform discrete sequences of closed Riemannian manifolds. In the negative sectional curvature case, we are able to remove the weakly uniform discreteness assumption. This is achieved by combining a refined Thick-Thin decomposition together with a Moser iteration argument for harmonic forms on manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of the profinite completion of good groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a residually finite, good group of finite virtual cohomological dimension. We prove that the natural monomorphism $G\hookrightarrow\hat{G}$ induces a bijective correspondence between conjugacy classes of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ and those of its profinite completion $\hat{G}$. Moreover, we prove that the centralizers and normalizers in $\hat{G}$ of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ are the closures of the respective centralizers and normalizers in $G$. With somewhat more restrictive hypotheses, we prove the same results for finite solvable subgroups of $G$. In the last section, we give a few applications of this theorem to hyperelliptic mapping class groups and virtually compact special toral relatively hyperbolic groups (these include fundamental groups of $3$-orbifolds and of uniform standard arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds).</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-isotopic unit conormal bundles in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any compact connected submanifold $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\Lambda_K$ denote its unit conormal bundle, which is a Legendrian submanifold of the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we give examples of pairs $(K_0,K_1)$ of compact connected submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\Lambda_{K_0}$ is not Legendrian isotopic to $\Lambda_{K_1}$, although they cannot be distinguished by classical invariants. Here, $K_1$ is the image of an embedding $\iota_f \colon K_0 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is regular homotopic to the inclusion map of $K_0$ and the codimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is greater than or equal to $4$. As non-classical invariants, we define the strip Legendrian contact homology and a coproduct on it under certain conditions on Legendrian submanifolds. Then, we give a purely topological description of these invariants for $\Lambda_K$ when the codimension of $K$ is greater than or equal to $4$. The main examples $\Lambda_{K_0}$ and $\Lambda_{K_1}$ are distinguished by the coproduct, which is computed by using an idea of string topology.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants of locally compact groups: the homotopical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical theory of homotopical $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma^n$ developed by Bieri, Neumann, Renz and Strebel for abstract groups, to $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n$ for locally compact Hausdorff groups. Given such a group $G$, our $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ are sets of continuous homomorphisms $G \to \mathbb{R}$ ("characters"). They match the classical $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma^n(G)$ if $G$ is discrete, and refine the homotopical compactness properties $\mathrm C_n$ of Abels and Tiemeyer. Moreover, our theory recovers the definition of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^1$ and $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^2$ proposed by Kochloukova.
  Besides presenting various characterizations of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n$ (particularly for $n\in \{1,2\}$), we show that characters in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ are also in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(H)$ if $H\le G$ is a closed cocompact subgroup, and we generalize several classical results. Namely, we prove that the set of nonzero elements of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ is open, we prove that characters in a group of type $\mathrm C_n$ that do not vanish on the center always lie in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$, and we relate the $\Sigma$-sets of a group with those of its quotients by closed subgroups of type $\mathrm C_n$. Lastly, we describe how $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ governs whether a closed normal subgroup with abelian quotient is of type $\mathrm C_n$, generalizing one of the highlights of the classical theory.</description>
