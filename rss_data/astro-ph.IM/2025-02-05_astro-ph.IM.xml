      <title>$Lux$: A generative, multi-output, latent-variable model for astronomical data with noisy labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large volume of spectroscopic data available now and from near-future surveys will enable high-dimensional measurements of stellar parameters and properties. Current methods for determining stellar labels from spectra use physics-driven models, which are computationally expensive and have limitations in their accuracy due to simplifications. While machine learning methods provide efficient paths toward emulating physics-based pipelines, they often do not properly account for uncertainties and have complex model structure, both of which can lead to biases and inaccurate label inference. Here we present $Lux$: a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra and labels that addresses prior limitations. $Lux$ is a generative, multi-output, latent variable model framework built on JAX for computational efficiency and flexibility. As a generative model, $Lux$ properly accounts for uncertainties and missing data in the input stellar labels and spectral data and can either be used in probabilistic or discriminative settings. Here, we present several examples of how $Lux$ can successfully emulate methods for precise stellar label determinations for stars ranging in stellar type and signal-to-noise from the $APOGEE$ surveys. We also show how a simple $Lux$ model is successful at performing label transfer between the $APOGEE$ and $GALAH$ surveys. $Lux$ is a powerful new framework for the analysis of large-scale spectroscopic survey data. Its ability to handle uncertainties while maintaining high precision makes it particularly valuable for stellar survey label inference and cross-survey analysis, and the flexible model structure allows for easy extension to other data types.</description>

      <title>Impact of phase signal formulations on tilt-to-length coupling noise in the LISA test mass interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can generate spurious displacement noise that potentially affects the measurement of gravitational wave signals. In each test mass interferometer, the coupling of misalignments with spacecraft angular jitter produces noise in the longitudinal pathlength signal. This signal comes from the phase readout combinations of an interfering measurement beam and a local reference beam at a quadrant photodetector, but various formulations exist for its calculation. Selection of this pathlength signal formulation affects the TTL coupling noise. We therefore simulated two pathlength signal candidates, the complex sum and the averaged phase, and evaluated their performance in the LISA test mass interferometer under the assumption of static alignment imperfections. All simulations were performed using three different methods with cross-checked results. We find with all three methods that the averaged phase is the choice with equal or less TTL coupling noise in four out of the five test cases. Finally, we show that the non-linear TTL contributions in the test mass interferometer to be negligible in all our test-cases, no matter which formulation of pathlength signal is chosen.</description>

      <title>Technical description and performance of the phase II version of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) is a series of upgrades for the Keck II Adaptive Optics (AO) system and the NIRSPEC spectrograph to enable diffraction limited, high resolution (R&gt;30000) spectroscopy of exoplanets and low mass companions in the K and L bands. Phase I consisted of single mode fiber injection/extraction units (FIU/FEU) used in conjunction with a H band pyramid wavefront sensor. The use of single mode fibers provides a gain in stellar rejection, a substantial reduction in sky background, and an extremely stable line spread function in the spectrograph. Phase II, deployed and commissioned in 2022, brought a 1000 actuator deformable mirror, beam shaping optics, a vortex mask, and other upgrades to the FIU/FEU. An additional service mission in 2024 extended operations down to y band, delivered an atmospheric dispersion corrector, and provided access to two laser frequency combs. KPIC phase II brings higher planet throughput, lower stellar leakage and many new observing modes which extend its ability to characterize exoplanets at high spectral resolution, building on the success of phase I. In this paper we present a description of the final phase II version of KPIC, along with results of system level laboratory testing and characterization showing the instrument's phase II throughput, stability, repeatability, and other key performance metrics prior to delivery and during installation at Keck. We outlined the capabilities of the various observing modes enabled by the new modules as well as efforts to compensate for static aberrations and non common path errors at Keck, which were issues that plagued phase I. Finally, we show results from commissioning.</description>

      <title>Development and Quality Control of PMT Modules for the Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The camera of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) consists of 1855 pixels that are grouped into 265 high-performance photomultiplier tube (PMT) modules. Each module comprises a seven-light-guide plate, seven PMT units, a slow control board, and a readout board with a trigger board. %In this paper we describe The requirements for the PMT modules include various aspects, such as photon detection efficiency, dynamic range, buffer depth, and test pulse functionality. We have developed a high-performance PMT module that fulfills all these requirements. Mass-production and quality control (QC) of modules for all four LSTs of the northern CTAO have been completed. Here we report on the technical details of each element of the module and its performance, together with the methods and results of QC measurements.</description>

      <title>Competition between Increasing and Decreasing Effects of the Afterpulsing Rate of PMTs during Night-Sky Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been widely used in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the latest-generation IACTs, are optimized for challenging observations of low-energy gamma rays, specifically in the 20 to 150 GeV range. To this end, PMTs with an exceptionally low afterpulsing probability have been developed and installed. However, the afterpulsing rate increases over time due to the infiltration of atmospheric molecules, particularly helium, into the tube. Interestingly, we found that the afterpulsing rate decreases when PMTs are operated at high voltage and exposed to light -- a condition naturally met during IACT observations. To evaluate the latest instrument response, after five years of operation, we removed several PMTs from the first LST, which is currently the only operational telescope among the CTAO instruments. Our laboratory measurements showed no increase in afterpulsing compared to pre-installation values. This suggests that the decrease in afterpulsing during operation offsets the increase, thereby maintaining the long-term performance of the PMTs.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Bench-v1: A Benchmark on Gravitational Physics Discovery for Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern science emerged from reasoning over repeatedly-observed planetary motions. We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. PhD-level solutions for each task are provided, to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.</description>

      <title>JWST sighting of decameter main-belt asteroids and view on meteorite sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth, including the more frequent megaton explosions from decameter impactors. While large asteroids ($\geq$100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution--which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth--varies significantly among models. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids ($\gtrapprox $10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST's infrared capabilities covering the asteroids' emission peaks and synthetic tracking techniques. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects' distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ${\sim}100$ m (debiased cumulative slopes of $q = -2.66\pm0.60$ and $-0.97\pm0.14$ for diameters smaller and larger than $\sim $100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families--most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia--according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families and the source regions of meteorites "in-situ".</description>

      <title>Resolved Stellar Mass Estimation of Nearby Late-type Galaxies for the SPHEREx Era: Dependence on Stellar Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming all-sky infrared spectrophotometric SPHEREx mission is set to provide spatially resolved stellar mass maps of nearby galaxies, offering more detailed insights than integrated light observations. In this study, we develop a strategy for estimating stellar mass using SPHEREx by examining the dependence on different stellar population synthesis (SPS) models and proposing new scaling relations based on simulated SPHEREx data. We estimate the resolved stellar masses of 19 nearby late-type galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, treating these as fiducial masses. By testing four SPS models covering infrared wavelengths, i.e., E-MILES, Bruzual \&amp; Charlot 2003 (BC03), Charlot \&amp; Bruzual 2019 (CB19), and FSPS, we find systematic differences in mass-to-light ratios at $3.6~{\rm \mu m}$ ($M_{\ast}/L_{\rm 3.6\mu m}$) among the SPS models. In particular, BC03 and CB19 yield mass-to-light ratios on average $\sim0.2-0.3~{\rm dex}$ lower than those from E-MILES and FSPS. These mass-to-light ratios strongly correlate with stellar age, indicating a significant impact of young stellar populations on stellar mass measurements. Our analysis, incorporating fiducial masses and simulated SPHEREx data, identifies the $1.6~{\rm \mu m}$ band as the optimal wavelength for stellar mass estimation, with the lowest scatter ($0.15-0.20~{\rm dex}$) of the stellar mass. This scatter can be further reduced to $0.10-0.12~{\rm dex}$ across all SPS models by incorporating optical and SPHEREx colors. These results can provide guidance for measuring the stellar masses of the numerous nearby galaxies that SPHEREx will survey.</description>

      <title>MAISTEP -- a new grid-based machine learning tool for inferring stellar parameters I. Ages of giant-planet host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of exoplanet demographics partly depends on their corresponding host star parameters. With the majority of exoplanet-host stars having only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their parameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to develop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar radius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age distribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach involves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of stellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and luminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the inferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and LEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars hosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our machine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias (and a scatter) of -0.5\% (5\%) and -0.2\% (2\%) in radius, 6\% (5\%) per cent and -2\% (3\%) in mass, and -9\% (16\%) and 7\% (23\%) in age, respectively. Therefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic inferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass planets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm Jupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These statistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on stellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the average age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are statistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cosmological Hydrodynamics for Field-Level Inference and High Dimensional Parameter Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations are the most accurate way to model structure formation in the universe, but they often involve a large number of astrophysical parameters modeling subgrid physics, in addition to cosmological parameters. This results in a high-dimensional space that is difficult to jointly constrain using traditional statistical methods due to prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we present a fully differentiable approach for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and a proof-of-concept implementation, diffhydro. By back-propagating through an upwind finite volume scheme for solving the Euler Equations jointly with a dark matter particle-mesh method for Poisson equation, we are able to efficiently evaluate derivatives of the output baryonic fields with respect to input density and model parameters. Importantly, we demonstrate how to differentiate through stochastically sampled discrete random variables, which frequently appear in subgrid models. We use this framework to rapidly sample sub-grid physics and cosmological parameters as well as perform field level inference of initial conditions using high dimensional optimization techniques. Our code is implemented in JAX (python), allowing easy code development and GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>The SAP-1 Payload: A Technology Demonstration for Space-Based Microbiology Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>

Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in the Measurement of Neutron lifetime Using Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18831</link>

Abstract: The lifetime of free neutrons measured in the lab has a long standing disparity of $\sim$9~s. A space-based technique has recently been proposed to independently measure the neutron lifetime using interactions between the galactic cosmic rays and a low atmosphere planetary body. This technique has not produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data that contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer on-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and quantify the effects of lunar sub-surface temperature and the composition on the measurement of neutron lifetime. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data when the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion period. We report the neutron lifetime using lunar composition maps at different resolutions: 5$^{\circ}$ Prettyman+2006 and 2$^{\circ}$ re-binned Wilson+2021 maps to be 777.59$\pm$11.71~s and 739.64$\pm$10.83~s respectively. Further, for the 20$^{\circ}$ map, we apply both a constant equatorial and a latitude-dependent temperature model and report 738.63$\pm$10.75~s and 767.33$\pm$11.17~s respectively. We report the weighted average of the four measurements to be $\tau_n = 754.72 ^{+34.58}_{-25.91}$~s.</description>
