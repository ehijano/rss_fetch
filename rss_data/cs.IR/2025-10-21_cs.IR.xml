      <title>Investigating the Association Between Text-Based Indications of Foodborne Illness from Yelp Reviews and New York City Health Inspection Outcomes (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foodborne illnesses are gastrointestinal conditions caused by consuming contaminated food. Restaurants are critical venues to investigate outbreaks because they share sourcing, preparation, and distribution of foods. Public reporting of illness via formal channels is limited, whereas social media platforms host abundant user-generated content that can provide timely public health signals. This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants. We discuss implications and outline next steps toward address-level analyses.</description>

      <title>Blending Learning to Rank and Dense Representations for Efficient and Effective Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exploitation of both lexical and neural relevance signals for ad-hoc passage retrieval. Our exploration involves a large-scale training dataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages are complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features extracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two different groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ a pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first stage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of the documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the set of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The results of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense retrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution significantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively minimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of up to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms the advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that mutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.</description>

      <title>FRONTIER-RevRec: A Large-scale Dataset for Reviewer Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reviewer recommendation is a critical task for enhancing the efficiency of academic publishing workflows. However, research in this area has been persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025) from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems. The FRONTIER-RevRec dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FRONTIER-RevRec-5D05.</description>

      <title>Right Answer at the Right Time - Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Graph Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering in temporal knowledge graphs requires retrieval that is both time-consistent and efficient. Existing RAG methods are largely semantic and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence. This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG baselines.</description>

      <title>Exact Nearest-Neighbor Search on Energy-Efficient FPGA Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the usage of FPGA devices for energy-efficient exact kNN search in high-dimension latent spaces. This work intercepts a relevant trend that tries to support the increasing popularity of learned representations based on neural encoder models by making their large-scale adoption greener and more inclusive. The paper proposes two different energy-efficient solutions adopting the same FPGA low-level configuration. The first solution maximizes system throughput by processing the queries of a batch in parallel over a streamed dataset not fitting into the FPGA memory. The second minimizes latency by processing each kNN incoming query in parallel over an in-memory dataset. Reproducible experiments on publicly available image and text datasets show that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based competitors regarding throughput, latency, and energy consumption. Specifically, experiments show that the proposed FPGA solutions achieve the best throughput in terms of queries per second and the best-observed latency with scale-up factors of up to 16.6X. Similar considerations can be made regarding energy efficiency, where results show that our solutions can achieve up to 11.9X energy saving w.r.t. strong CPU-based competitors.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Framework for Whole-Page Reranking via Single-Modal Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The whole-page reranking plays a critical role in shaping the user experience of search engines, which integrates retrieval results from multiple modalities, such as documents, images, videos, and LLM outputs. Existing methods mainly rely on large-scale human-annotated data, which is costly to obtain and time-consuming. This is because whole-page annotation is far more complex than single-modal: it requires assessing the entire result page while accounting for cross-modal relevance differences. Thus, how to improve whole-page reranking performance while reducing annotation costs is still a key challenge in optimizing search engine result pages(SERP). In this paper, we propose SMAR, a novel whole-page reranking framework that leverages strong Single-modal rankers to guide Modal-wise relevance Alignment for effective Reranking, using only limited whole-page annotation to outperform fully-annotated reranking models. Specifically, high-quality single-modal rankers are first trained on data specific to their respective modalities. Then, for each query, we select a subset of their outputs to construct candidate pages and perform human annotation at the page level. Finally, we train the whole-page reranker using these limited annotations and enforcing consistency with single-modal preferences to maintain ranking quality within each modality. Experiments on the Qilin and Baidu datasets demonstrate that SMAR reduces annotation costs by about 70-90\% while achieving significant ranking improvements compared to baselines. Further offline and online A/B testing on Baidu APPs also shows notable gains in standard ranking metrics as well as user experience indicators, fully validating the effectiveness and practical value of our approach in real-world search scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Layout Is the Model: On Action-Item Coupling in Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g., watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action given item" and (P3) no information leakage.
  While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens) naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving. Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both accurate and efficient.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.</description>

      <title>DSEBench: A Test Collection for Explainable Dataset Search with Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset search has been an established information retrieval task. Current paradigms either retrieve datasets that are relevant to a keyword query or find datasets that are similar to an input target dataset. To allow for their combined specification of information needs, in this article, we investigate the more generalized task of Dataset Search with Examples (DSE) and further extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of sparse, dense, and LLM-based retrieval, reranking, and explanation methods.</description>

      <title>On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17245v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</description>

      <title>How role-play shapes relevance judgment in zero-shot LLM rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular, role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity, often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while receiving limited interaction with query or document representations. Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.</description>

      <title>BPL: Bias-adaptive Preference Distillation Learning for Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via: https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL.</description>

      <title>DTKG: Dual-Track Knowledge Graph-Verified Reasoning Framework for Multi-Hop QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs). The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question, i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation in RIS-aided Systems via Observation Matrix Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communications through dense antenna arrays. Accurate channel estimation is critical to unlocking their full performance potential. To enhance RIS channel estimators, this paper proposes a novel observation matrix design scheme. Bayesian optimization framework is adopted to generate observation matrices that maximize the mutual information between received pilot signals and RIS channels. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop an alternating Riemannian manifold optimization (ARMO) algorithm to alternately update the receiver combiners and RIS phase-shift matrices. An adaptive kernel training strategy is further introduced to iteratively refine the channel covariance matrix without requiring additional pilot resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARMO-enhanced estimator achieves substantial gains in estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Prompt Optimization via Retrieved Reasoning Assets and Multi-Agent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Safire: Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective visualization retrieval necessitates a clear definition of similarity. Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Aware Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.</description>

      <title>Rethinking On-policy Optimization for Query Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made available to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.</description>

      <title>OG-Rank: Learning to Rank Fast and Slow with Uncertainty and Reward-Trend Guided Adaptive Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker, we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45, nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56, nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond clinical order selection.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly OVD Adaptation with FLAME: Few-shot Localization via Active Marginal-Samples Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.</description>

      <title>From Relevance to Utility: Evidence Retrieval with Feedback for Fact Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-enhanced methods have become a primary approach in fact verification (FV); it requires reasoning over multiple retrieved pieces of evidence to verify the integrity of a claim. To retrieve evidence, existing work often employs off-the-shelf retrieval models whose design is based on the probability ranking principle. We argue that, rather than relevance, for FV we need to focus on the utility that a claim verifier derives from the retrieved evidence. We introduce the feedback-based evidence retriever(FER) that optimizes the evidence retrieval process by incorporating feedback from the claim verifier. As a feedback signal we use the divergence in utility between how effectively the verifier utilizes the retrieved evidence and the ground-truth evidence to produce the final claim label. Empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of FER over prevailing baselines.</description>

      <title>Learnable Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, a crucial challenge is transforming recommendation data into the language space of LLMs through effective item tokenization. Current approaches, such as ID, textual, and codebook-based identifiers, exhibit shortcomings in encoding semantic information, incorporating collaborative signals, or handling code assignment bias. To address these limitations, we propose LETTER (a LEarnable Tokenizer for generaTivE Recommendation), which integrates hierarchical semantics, collaborative signals, and code assignment diversity to satisfy the essential requirements of identifiers. LETTER incorporates Residual Quantized VAE for semantic regularization, a contrastive alignment loss for collaborative regularization, and a diversity loss to mitigate code assignment bias. We instantiate LETTER on two models and propose a ranking-guided generation loss to augment their ranking ability theoretically. Experiments on three datasets validate the superiority of LETTER, advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of LLM-based generative recommendation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have emerged as a powerful technique for learning representations from user-item interaction data in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences. Implementation codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Responsible Adaptation of Large Language Models for Robust and Equitable Top-k Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional recommendation systems (RSs) are typically optimized to enhance performance metrics uniformly across all training samples, inadvertently overlooking the needs of diverse user populations. The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness to sub-populations due to the varying user properties. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in enhancing RS performance, their practical applicability is hindered by high costs, inference latency, and degraded performance on long user queries. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework designed to promote social good by equitably serving all user groups. By adopting a two-phase approach, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task. We evaluate our hybrid framework by incorporating eight different recommendation algorithms and three different LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness to subpopulations without disproportionately escalating costs.</description>

      <title>GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</description>

      <title>SRA-CL: Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has shown effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation models. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training.

      <title>Adaptive Data-Resilient Multi-Modal Hierarchical Multi-Label Book Genre Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying fine-grained book genres is essential for enhancing user experience through efficient discovery, personalized recommendations, and improved reader engagement. At the same time, it provides publishers and marketers with valuable insights into consumer preferences and emerging market trends. While traditional genre classification methods predominantly rely on textual reviews or content analysis, the integration of additional modalities, such as book covers, blurbs, and metadata, offers richer contextual cues. However, the effectiveness of such multi-modal systems is often hindered by incomplete, noisy, or missing data across modalities. To address this, we propose IMAGINE (Intelligent Multi-modal Adaptive Genre Identification NEtwork), a framework designed to leverage multi-modal data while remaining robust to missing or unreliable information. IMAGINE learns modality-specific feature representations and adaptively prioritizes the most informative sources available at inference time. It further employs a hierarchical classification strategy, grounded in a curated taxonomy of book genres, to capture inter-genre relationships and support multi-label assignments reflective of real-world literary diversity. A key strength of IMAGINE is its adaptability: it maintains high predictive performance even when one modality, such as text or image, is unavailable. We also curated a large-scale hierarchical dataset that structures book genres into multiple levels of granularity, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that IMAGINE outperformed strong baselines in various settings, with significant gains in scenarios involving incomplete modality-specific data.</description>

      <title>MiLQ: Benchmarking IR Models for Bilingual Web Search with Mixed Language Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite bilingual speakers frequently using mixed-language queries in web searches, Information Retrieval (IR) research on them remains scarce. To address this, we introduce MiLQ, Mixed-Language Query test set, the first public benchmark of mixed-language queries, qualified as realistic and relatively preferred. Experiments show that multilingual IR models perform moderately on MiLQ and inconsistently across native, English, and mixed-language queries, also suggesting code-switched training data's potential for robust IR models handling such queries. Meanwhile, intentional English mixing in queries proves an effective strategy for bilinguals searching English documents, which our analysis attributes to enhanced token matching compared to native queries.</description>

      <title>Hard Negatives, Hard Lessons: Revisiting Training Data Quality for Robust Information Retrieval with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of 15 datasets from the BGE collection, reduces the training set size by 2.35$\times$, surprisingly increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We utilize LLMs as a simple, cost-effective approach to identify and relabel false negatives in training datasets. Experimental results show that relabeling false negatives as true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B retrieval models by 0.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.4 points on BEIR and by 1.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.8 points at nDCG@10 on zero-shot AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of LLMs to identify false negatives is supported by human annotation results. Our training dataset and code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>RewardRank: Optimizing True Learning-to-Rank Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional ranking systems optimize offline proxy objectives that rely on oversimplified assumptions about user behavior, often neglecting factors such as position bias and item diversity. Consequently, these models fail to improve true counterfactual utilities such as such as click-through rate or purchase probability, when evaluated in online A/B tests. We introduce RewardRank, a data-driven learning-to-rank (LTR) framework for counterfactual utility maximization. RewardRank first learns a reward model that predicts the utility of any ranking directly from logged user interactions, and then trains a ranker to maximize this reward using a differentiable soft permutation operator. To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further propose two benchmark suites: (i) Parametric Oracle Evaluation (PO-Eval), which employs an open-source click model as a counterfactual oracle on the Baidu-ULTR dataset, and (ii) LLM-as-User Evaluation (LAU-Eval), which simulates realistic user behavior via large language models on the Amazon-KDD-Cup dataset. RewardRank achieves the highest counterfactual utility across both benchmarks and demonstrates that optimizing classical metrics such as NDCG is sub-optimal for maximizing true user utility. Finally, using real user feedback from the Baidu-ULTR dataset, RewardRank establishes a new state of the art in offline relevance performance. Overall, our results show that learning-to-rank can be reformulated as direct optimization of counterfactual utility, achieved in a purely data-driven manner without relying on explicit modeling assumptions such as position bias.

      <title>Familiarity-Aware Evidence Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates. Additionally, we demonstrate the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge during evidence compression.</description>

      <title>Traceback of Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, recent research has revealed RAG's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database, leading to attacker-desired responses. Existing defenses, which predominantly focus on inference-time mitigation, have proven insufficient against sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce RAGForensics, the first traceback system for RAG, designed to identify poisoned texts within the knowledge database that are responsible for the attacks. RAGForensics operates iteratively, first retrieving a subset of texts from the database and then utilizing a specially crafted prompt to guide an LLM in detecting potential poisoning texts. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGForensics against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks. This work pioneers the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems, providing a practical and promising defense mechanism to enhance their security.

      <title>MatPROV: A Provenance Graph Dataset of Material Synthesis Extracted from Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However, existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations, we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Who Taught the Lie? Responsibility Attribution for Poisoned Knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge into large language models to improve response quality. However, recent work has shown that RAG systems are highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious texts are inserted into the knowledge database to influence model outputs. While several defenses have been proposed, they are often circumvented by more adaptive or sophisticated attacks.
  This paper presents RAGOrigin, a black-box responsibility attribution framework designed to identify which texts in the knowledge database are responsible for misleading or incorrect generations. Our method constructs a focused attribution scope tailored to each misgeneration event and assigns a responsibility score to each candidate text by evaluating its retrieval ranking, semantic relevance, and influence on the generated response. The system then isolates poisoned texts using an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate RAGOrigin across seven datasets and fifteen poisoning attacks, including newly developed adaptive poisoning strategies and multi-attacker scenarios. Our approach outperforms existing baselines in identifying poisoned content and remains robust under dynamic and noisy conditions. These results suggest that RAGOrigin provides a practical and effective solution for tracing the origins of corrupted knowledge in RAG systems.

      <title>DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this, existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable, and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs), adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive development of more capable RAG systems.</description>

      <title>MedTrust-RAG: Evidence Verification and Trust Alignment for Biomedical Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However, RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence, undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM) that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response patterns.</description>
