      <title>Controlled Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Porous Media Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</description>

      <title>Learning earthquake sources using symmetric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02404v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines deep-focus earthquakes, aiming to accurately determine the P and pP source-time functions (STFs) and their azimuthal dependence. We use the variational symmetric autoencoder (VSymAE), a neural network architecture designed to automatically isolate earthquake information from far-field seismic waves. Our findings demonstrate that the STFs produced by the network uncover weak secondary episodes in numerous earthquakes, providing evidence that the majority deep-focus earthquakes release bursts of seismic moment. This groundbreaking study is the first to generate high resolution STFs without requiring traditional path-effect deconvolution, a process that usually introduces substantial uncertainties and hinders achieving high temporal resolution. Our unsupervised learning method for obtaining STFs does not require labeled seismograms and is based on the principle of scale separation, which allows the accumulation of earthquake information from nearby receivers. This principle states that the variations in far-field band-limited seismic measurements resulting from finite faulting occur across two spatial scales: a slower scale associated with the source processes and a faster scale corresponding to path effects. This research compares the STFs obtained from VSymAE with those gathered by stacking envelopes. We show that the principal features of VSymAE-derived STFs align with those of envelope stacking, especially in dense seismic networks that record large-magnitude earthquakes with high signal-to-noise ratios. However, VSymAE can effectively extract source details from fewer stations or in situations with low signal-to-noise ratios, where envelope stacking may not work; this capability is vital for directivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Learned frequency-domain scattered wavefield solutions using neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the wave equation is essential to seismic imaging and inversion. The numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation, fundamental to this process, often encounters significant computational and memory challenges. We propose an innovative frequency-domain scattered wavefield modeling method employing neural operators adaptable to diverse seismic velocities. The source location and frequency information are embedded within the input background wavefield, enhancing the neural operator's ability to process source configurations effectively. In addition, we utilize a single reference frequency, which enables scaling from larger-domain forward modeling to higher-frequency scenarios, thereby improving our method's accuracy and generalization capabilities for larger-domain applications. Several tests on the OpenFWI datasets and realistic velocity models validate the accuracy and efficacy of our method as a surrogate model, demonstrating its potential to address the computational and memory limitations of numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based subsurface CO$_2$ multiphysics monitoring and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from industrial outputs. Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Multiple reflections on Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to Huygens' principle, all points on a wave front act as secondary sources emitting spherical waves, and the envelope of these spherical waves forms a new wave front. In the mathematical formulation of Huygens' principle, the waves emitted by the secondary sources are represented by Green's functions. In many present-day applications of Huygens' principle, these Green's functions are replaced by their time-reversed versions, thus forming a basis for backpropagation, imaging, inversion, seismic interferometry, etc. However, when the input wave field is available only on a single open boundary, this approach has its limitations. In particular, it does not properly account for multiply reflected waves. This is remedied by a modified form of Huygens' principle, in which the Green's functions are replaced by focusing functions. The modified Huygens' principle forms a basis for imaging, inverse scattering, monitoring of induced sources, etc., thereby properly taking multiply reflected waves into account.</description>
