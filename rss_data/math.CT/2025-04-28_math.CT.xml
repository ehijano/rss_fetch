      <title>Monoidal Quantaloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to add a symmetric monoidal structure to quantaloids in a compatible way. In particular, dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. Examples of such quantaloids are the category qRel of quantum sets and binary relations, and the category V-Rel of sets and binary relations with values in a commutative unital quantale V. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. Discrete quantization, a process of generalization mathematical structures to the noncommutative setting can be regarded as the process of internalizing these structures in qRel, whereas fuzzification, the process of introducing degrees of truth or membership to concepts that are traditionally considered either true or false, can be regarded as the process of internalizing structures in V-Rel. Hence, we investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quantaloids.</description>

      <title>On Artin algebras whose indecomposable modules are determined by composition factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured at the end of the book "Representation theory of Artin algebras" by M. Auslander, I. Reiten and S. Smalo that an Artin algebra with the property that its finitely generated indecomposable modules are up to isomorphism completely determined by theirs composition factors is of finite representation type. Examples of rings with this property are the semisimple artinian rings and the rings of the form $\mathbb{Z}_n$. An affirmative answer is obtained for some special cases, namely, the commutative, the hereditary and the radical square zero case.</description>

      <title>Mackey functors from the viewpoint of double category theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. In this paper, we first introduce a new notion, so-called the Mackey double category of $G$. Then we prove that the category of Mackey double categories and the category of Mackey functors of $G$ are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Naive co-contra correspondence for $\mathcal D$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a triangulated equivalence between the derived categories of quasi-coherent and contraherent $\mathcal A$-modules for a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra $\mathcal A$ over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$. The sheaf of rings of differential operators $\mathcal D$ (or fiberwise differential operators for a smooth morphism of schemes) is the thematic example of a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra.</description>

      <title>Categories by Kan extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories can be identified -- up to isomorphism -- with polynomial comonads on Set. The left Kan extension of a functor along itself is always a comonad -- called the density comonad -- so it defines a category when its carrier is polynomial. We provide a number of generalizations of this to produce new categories from old, as well as from distributive laws of monads over comonads. For example, all Lawvere theories, all product completions of small categories, and the simplicial indexing category $\Delta^{op}$ arise in this way. Another, seemingly much less well-known, example constructs a so-called selection category from a polynomial comonad in a way that's somehow dual to the construction of a Lawvere theory category from a monad; we'll discuss this in more detail. Along the way, we will see various constructions of non-polynomial comonads as well.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of tensor products of irreducible categorifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1336</link>
      <description>arXiv:1303.1336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an axiomatic definition for a tensor product categorification. A tensor product categorification is an abelian category with a categorical action of a Kac-Moody algebra g in the sense of Rouquier or Khovanov-Lauda whose Grothendieck group is isomorphic to a tensor product of simple modules. However, we require a much stronger structure than a mere isomorphism of representations; most importantly, each such categorical representation must have standardly stratified structure compatible with the categorification functors, and with combinatorics matching those of the tensor product. With these stronger conditions, we recover a uniqueness theorem similar in flavor to that of Rouquier for categorifications of simple modules. Furthermore, we already know of an example of such a categorification: the representations of algebras T^\lambda previously defined by the second author using generators and relations. Next, we show that tensor product categorifications give a categorical realization of tensor product crystals analogous to that for simple crystals given by cyclotomic quotients of KLR algebras. Examples of such categories are also readily found in more classical representation theory; for finite and affine type A, tensor product categorifications can be realized as quotients of the representation categories of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.</description>

      <title>(Co)module algebras and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09810v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the "official" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions.

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>Globular subdivisions are dihomotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any globular subdivision of multipointed $d$-spaces gives rise to a dihomotopy equivalence between the associated flows. As a straightforward application, the flows associated to two multipointed $d$-spaces related by a finite zigzag of globular subdivisions have isomorphic branching and merging homology theories and isomorphic underlying homotopy types.</description>
