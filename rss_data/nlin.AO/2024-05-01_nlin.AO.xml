      <title>U.S. Election Hardens Hate Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local or national politics can trigger potentially dangerous hate in someone. But with a third of the world's population eligible to vote in elections in 2024 alone, we lack understanding of how individual-level hate multiplies up to hate behavior at the collective global scale. Here we show, based on the most recent U.S. election, that offline events are associated with a rapid adaptation of the global online hate universe that hardens (strengthens) both its network-of-networks structure and the 'flavors' of hate content that it collectively produces. Approximately 50 million potential voters in hate communities are drawn closer to each other and to the broad mainstream of approximately 2 billion others. It triggers new hate content at scale around immigration, ethnicity, and antisemitism that aligns with conspiracy theories about Jewish-led replacement before blending in hate around gender identity/sexual orientation, and religion. Telegram acts as a key hardening agent - yet is overlooked by U.S. Congressional hearings and new E.U. legislation. Because the hate universe has remained robust since 2020, anti-hate messaging surrounding not only upcoming elections but also other events like the war in Gaza, should pivot to blending multiple hate 'flavors' while targeting previously untouched social media structures.</description>

      <title>New Trends on the Systems Approach to Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Pandemics in a Globally Connected Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>
