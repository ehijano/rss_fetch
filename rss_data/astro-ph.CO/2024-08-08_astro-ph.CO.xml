      <title>Constraints on Primordial Magnetic Fields from High Redshift Stellar Mass Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, Stellar Mass Density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts $z &gt; 6$ and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of $\lambda=1\,{\rm Mpc}$, denoted as $B_0$, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, $n_{\rm B}$. At 95\% confidence level, we establish upper limits of $B_0 &lt; 4.44$ nG and $n_{\rm B} &lt; -2.24$, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately $f_*^0 \sim 0.1$. If we fix $n_{\rm B}$ at specific values, such as $-2.85$, $-2.9$, and $-2.95$, the 95\% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33 nG, 2.21 nG, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using the theory of PMFs, and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>An improved Tully-Fisher estimate of $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an improved comprehensive method for determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the Tully-Fisher relation. By fitting a peculiar velocity model in conjunction with the Tully-Fisher relation, all available data can be used to derive self-consistent Tully-Fisher parameters. In comparison to previous approaches, our method offers several improvements: it can be readily generalised to different forms of the Tully-Fisher relation and its intrinsic scatter; it uses a peculiar velocity model to predict distances more accurately; it can account for all selection effects; it uses the entire dataset to fit the Tully-Fisher relation; and it is fully self-consistent. The Tully-Fisher relation zero-point is calibrated using the subset of galaxies with distances from absolute distance indicators. We demonstrate this method on the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue $i$-band and $W1$-band Tully-Fisher samples and show that the uncertainties from fitting the Tully-Fisher relation amount to only 0.2 km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. Using all available absolute distance calibrators, we obtain $H_0=73.3$ $\pm$ 2.1 (stat) $\pm$ 3.5 (sys) km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, where the statistical uncertainty is dominated by the small number of galaxies with absolute distance estimates. The substantial systematic uncertainty reflects inconsistencies between various zero-point calibrations of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation, the tip of the red giant branch standard candle, and the Type Ia supernova standard candle. However, given a reliable set of absolute distance calibrators, our method promises enhanced precision in $H_0$ measurements from large new Tully-Fisher samples such as the WALLABY survey.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the type Ia supernova host galaxy step in the outer regions of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 1533 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the five-year sample of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we investigate the effects of projected galactocentric separation between the SNe and their host galaxies on their light curves and standardization. We show, for the first time, that the difference in SN Ia post-standardization brightnesses between high and low-mass hosts reduces from $0.078\pm0.011$ mag in the full sample to $0.036 \pm 0.018$ mag for SNe Ia located in the outer regions of their host galaxies, while increasing to $0.100 \pm 0.014$ mag for SNe in the inner regions. In these inner regions, the step can be reduced (but not removed) using a model where the $R_V$ of dust along the line-of-sight to the SN changes as a function of galaxy properties. To explain the remaining difference, we use the distributions of the SN Ia stretch parameter to test whether the inferred age of SN progenitors are more varied in the inner regions of galaxies. We find that the proportion of high-stretch SNe Ia in red (older) environments is more prominent in outer regions and that the outer regions stretch distributions are overall more homogeneous compared to inner regions, but conclude that this effect cannot explain the reduction in significance of any Hubble residual step in outer regions. We conclude that the standardized distances of SNe Ia located in the outer regions of galaxies are less affected by their global host galaxy properties than those in the inner regions.</description>

      <title>Invariance transformations in wave-optics lensing: implications for gravitational-wave astrophysics and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers unique opportunities to learn about the astrophysical origin of distant sources, the abundance of intervening objects acting as lenses, and gravity and cosmology in general. However, all this information can only be retrieved as long as one can disentangle each effect from the finite number of observables. In the geometric optics regime, typical of electromagnetic radiation, when the wavelength of the lensed signal is small compared to the size of the lens, there are invariance transformations that change the mass of the lens and the source-lens configuration but leave the observables unchanged. Neglecting this ``mass-sheet degeneracy'' can lead to biased lens parameters or unrealistic low uncertainties, which could then transfer to an incorrect cosmography study. This might be different for gravitational waves as their long wavelengths can be comparable to the lens size and lensing enters into the wave-optics limit. We explore the existence of invariance transformations in the wave-optics regime of gravitational-wave lensing, extending previous work and examining the implications for astrophysical and cosmological studies. We study these invariance transformations using three different methods of increasing level of complexity: template mismatch, Fisher Matrix, and Bayesian parameter estimation. We find that, for a sufficiently loud signal, the degeneracy is partially broken and the lens and cosmological parameters, e.g. $H_0$, can be retrieved independently and unbiased. In current ground-based detectors, though, considering also population studies, a strong constraint on these parameters seems quite remote and the prevailing degeneracy implies a larger uncertainty in the lens model reconstruction. However, with better sensitivity of the third-generation ground-based detectors, a meaningful constraint on $H_0$ is possible to obtain.</description>

      <title>Effects of a local physics change on the SH0ES determination of $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, a significant discrepancy between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) values derived from early-time (Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) and late-time (Cepheid-calibrated Type Ia Supernovae) measurements, remains a major challenge in cosmology. Traditional attempts to resolve this tension have struggled to maintain consistency with dynamical and geometrical probes at redshifts $0.01 &lt; z \lesssim 2.5$. We explore a novel model introducing new degrees of freedom in local physical laws affecting calibrators like Cepheids and Type Ia Supernovae within a distance of $d \lesssim 50$ Mpc ($z \lesssim 0.01$). Specifically, we incorporate a gravitational transition causing a change in the gravitational constant ($G$) at a specific distance, affecting the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation (PLR) and the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia. We verify the inverse scaling of SN luminosity $L$ with Chandrasekhar Mass $M_C$ in a changed $G$ scenario as predicted using a semi-analytical model in a recent theoretical study \cite{Wright2018}. Fixing $\Delta G/G \approx 0.04$, our model naturally resolves the Hubble tension, yielding a best-fit $H_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, even without using Planck data. This approach suggests a potential resolution to the Hubble tension by aligning $H_0$ with high-redshift CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES -- XIV. Time-delay and differential dust extinction determination with lensed type II supernova color curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is one of the most relevant unsolved problems in cosmology today. Strongly gravitationally lensed transient objects, such as strongly lensed supernovae, are an independent and competitive probe that can be used to determine the Hubble constant. In this context, the time delay between different images of lensed supernovae is a key ingredient. We present a method, to retrieve time delays and the amount of differential dust extinction between multiple images of lensed type IIP supernovae through their color curves, which display a kink in the time evolution. With multiple realistic mock color curves based on an observed unlensed supernova from the Carnegie Supernova Project, we demonstrate that we can retrieve the time delay with uncertainties of $\pm$1.0 days for light curves with 2-day cadence and 35% missing data due to weather losses. The differential dust extinction is more susceptible to uncertainties, because it depends on imposing the correct extinction law. Further we also investigate the kink structure in the color curves for different rest-frame wavelength bands, particularly rest-frame UV light curves from SWIFT, finding sufficiently strong kinks for our method to work for typical lensed SN redshifts that would redshift the kink feature to optical wavelengths. With the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, hundreds of strongly lensed supernovae will be detected and our new method for lensed SN IIP is readily applicable to provide delays.</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (L21 DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <title>The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program: The JWST J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) Extragalactic Distance Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle based on the constant luminosities of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the J band. The JAGB method is independent of the Cepheid and TRGB distance indicators. Therefore, we can leverage it to both cross-check Cepheid and TRGB distances for systematic errors and use it to measure an independent local Hubble constant. The JAGB method also boasts a number of advantages in measuring distances relative to the TRGB and Cepheids, several of which are especially amplified when combined with JWST's revolutionary resolving power. First, JAGB stars are 1 mag brighter in the NIR than the TRGB, and can be discovered from single-epoch NIR photometry unlike Cepheids which require congruent optical imaging in at least 12 epochs. Thus, JAGB stars can be used to measure significantly farther distances than both the TRGB stars and Cepheids using the same amount of observing time. Further advantages include: JAGB stars are easily identified solely via their colors and magnitudes, dust extinction is reduced in near-infrared observations, and JAGB stars are ubiquitous in all galaxies with intermediate-age populations. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that identifies the optimal location in a galaxy for applying the JAGB method, so as to minimize effects from crowding. We then deploy this algorithm in JWST NIRCam imaging of seven SN Ia host galaxies to measure their JAGB distances, undertaking a completely blind analysis. The zero-point of this JAGB distance scale is set in the water mega-maser galaxy NGC 4258. In our CCHP overview paper Freedman et al. (2024), we apply the JAGB distances measured in this paper to the Carnegie Supernova Program (CSP) SNe Ia sample, measuring a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.96 +/- 1.85 (stat) km/s/Mpc.</description>

      <title>AstroSat UV Deep Field South -- I. Far and Near-ultraviolet Source Catalog of the GOODS South region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the AstroSat UV Deep Field South (AUDFs), an imaging survey using the wide-field Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board AstroSat. AUDFs covers $\sim 236$ arcmin$^{2}$ of the sky area, including the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) South field in F154W and N242W filters. The deep and shallow parts of AUDFs have exposure time $\sim 62000$ and $\sim31000$ sec respectively, in the F154W filter, while in the N242W filter, they are $\sim 64000$ and $\sim34000$ sec. These observations reached a $3\sigma$ depth of 27.2 and 27.7 AB mag with a $50\%$ completeness limit of 27 and 27.6 AB mag in the F154W and N242W filters, respectively. With the acquired depth, AUDFs is the deepest far and near-UV imaging data covering the largest area known to date at 1.2" - 1.6" spatial resolution. Two primary catalogs were constructed for the F154W and N242W filters, each containing 13495 and 19374 sources brighter than the 3$\sigma$ detection limit, respectively. Our galaxy counts power-law slope $\sim0.43$~dex~mag$^{-1}$ in the N242W filter matches well with HST/WFC3/UVIS observations.
  A wide range of extra-galactic science can be achieved with this unique data, such as providing a sample of galaxies emitting ionizing photons in the redshift range $z \sim 1 - 3$ and beyond; constraining the UV luminosity function, investigating the extended-UV (XUV) emission around star-forming galaxies and UV morphologies for $z &lt; 1$. The UV catalog will enhance the legacy value of the existing optical/IR imaging and spectroscopic observations from ground and space-based telescopes on the GOODS South field.</description>

      <title>Probing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with colliders and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Two novel $f(Q)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel models in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity to explain our accelerated universe, namely the exponential $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model and the hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)_{HT}$ model. The current cosmological electromagnetic observations including the cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB), the baryon acoustic oscillations(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SN) and the direct measurements of H(z), combined with the simulated gravitational-wave data are used to constrain the $f(Q)$ models. We find that the Hubble tension can be significantly alleviated to $1.40\sigma$ level in the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model. The fitting $\chi^2$ of the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model is $9.75\sigma$ poorer than that of the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model, implying the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model would be excluded by future gravitational-wave observation.</description>

      <title>Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Capture of Dark Matter by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the dense environment, neutron stars (NSs) can serve as an ideal laboratory for studying the interactions between dark matter (DM) and ordinary matter. In the process of DM capture, deep inelastic scattering may dominate over elastic scattering, especially for the DM with a large momentum transfer. In this work, we calculate DM-nucleon deep inelastic scattering via a vector mediator and estimate its contribution to the capture rate. Using the surface temperature of the NSs, we derive the exclusion limits for the DM-nucleon scattering cross section in the mass range, $1~{\rm GeV}&lt;m_{\chi}&lt; 10^{5}~{\rm GeV}$. We find the bounds for DM with the mass $\gtrsim$ 1 GeV can be changed several times after including the deep inelastic scattering contribution.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to perform the exact convolution of the model prediction for bispectrum multipoles in redshift space with the survey window function. We extend a widely applied method for the power spectrum convolution to the bispectrum, taking advantage of a 2D-FFTlog algorithm. As a preliminary test of its accuracy, we consider the toy model of a spherical window function in real space. This setup provides an analytical evaluation of the 3-point function of the window, and therefore it allows to isolate and quantify possible systematic errors of the method. We find that our implementation of the convolution in terms of a mixing matrix shows differences at the percent level in comparison to the measurements from a very large set of mock halo catalogs. It is also able to recover unbiased constraints on halo bias parameters in a likelihood analysis of a set of numerical simulations with a total volume of $100\, h^{-3} \, {\rm Gpc}^3$. For the level of accuracy required by these tests, the multiplication with the mixing matrix is performed in the time of one second or less.</description>

Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) leave unique signatures in the bispectrum of the large-scale structure. With upcoming galaxy surveys set to improve PNG constraints by at least one order of magnitude, it is important to account for any potential contamination. In our work we show how to include wide-angle effects into the 3-dimensional observed galaxy bispectrum. We compute the leading wide-angle corrections to the monopole, finding that they could mimic local PNG with an amplitude of $f_{\rm NL} = \mathcal{O}\left( 0.1 \right)$. We also compute the dipole induced by wide-angle effects, whose amplitude is a few-percent of the flat-sky monopole. We estimate that wide-angle effects in the monopole can be safely neglected for survey volumes of the order of $8~\mathrm{Gpc}^3 h^{-3}$, while the dipole can start being detected from surveys probing volumes larger than $50~\mathrm{Gpc}^3 h^{-3}$. Our formalism can be readily adapted to realistic survey geometries and to include relativistic effects, which may become relevant at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic non-Gaussianity with generic vacua and detection prospects in CMB spectral distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a slow-roll inflationary model where conformal invariance of the Maxwell action is broken via a non-minimal kinetic coupling term, we investigate the non-Gaussian three-point cross-correlation function between the primordial curvature perturbation and the primordial magnetic field, under a fairly general choice of initial vacua for both the scalar and the gauge field sectors. Among the possible triangular configurations of the resulting cross-bispectrum, we find that the squeezed limit leads to local-type non-Gaussianity allowing a product form decomposition in terms of the scalar and magnetic power spectra, which is a generic result independent of any specific choice of the initial states. We subsequently explore its detection prospects in the CMB via correlations between pre-recombination $\mu$-type spectral distortions and temperature anisotropies, sourced by such a primordial cross-correlation. Our analysis with several proposed next-generation CMB missions forecasts a low value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the $\mu T$ spectrum if both the vacua are assumed to be pure Bunch-Davies. On the contrary, the SNR may be enhanced significantly for non-Bunch-Davies initial states for the magnetic sector within allowed bounds from current CMB data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the first-order phase transition catalyzed by primordial black holes~(PBHs) in the early Universe. We find that super-horizon curvature perturbations generated in this scenario lead to the production of gravitational waves when the scalar modes re-enter the horizon. If PBHs with masses about $10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ constitute all dark matter, the first-order electroweak phase transition catalyzed by PBHs can explain the gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing array collaborations without the overproduction of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Correlated scalar perturbations and gravitational waves from axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar and tensor fluctuations generated during inflation can be correlated, if arising from the same underlying mechanism. In this paper we investigate such correlation in the model of axion inflation, where the rolling inflaton produces quanta of a $U(1)$ gauge field which, in turn, source scalar and tensor fluctuations. We compute the primordial correlator of the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, with the gravitational energy density, $\Omega_{GW}$, at frequencies probed by gravitational wave detectors. This two-point function receives two contributions: one arising from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations generated by the standard mechanism of amplification of vacuum fluctuations, and the other coming from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations sourced by the gauge field. Our analysis shows that the former effect is generally dominant. For typical values of the parameters, the correlator, normalized by the amplitude of $\zeta$ and by the fractional energy in gravitational waves at interferometer frequencies, turns out to be of the order of $ 10^{-4}\div 10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.</description>

      <title>Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from DM self-interactions can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a dark matter deficit galaxy resembling DF2. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of DM self-interactions. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mock halo catalogues are indispensable data products for developing and validating cosmological inference pipelines. A major challenge in generating mock catalogues is modelling the halo or galaxy bias, which is the mapping from matter density to dark matter halos or observable galaxies. To this end, N-body codes produce state-of-the-art catalogues. However, generating large numbers of these N-body simulations for big volumes, requires significant computational time. We introduce and benchmark a differentiable and physics-informed neural network that can generate mock halo catalogues of comparable quality to those obtained from full N-body codes. The model design is computationally efficient for the training procedure and the production of large mock suites. We present a neural network, relying only on 18 to 34 trainable parameters, that produces halo catalogues from dark matter overdensity fields. The reduction of network weights is realised through incorporating symmetries motivated by first principles into our model architecture. We train our model using dark matter only N-body simulations across different resolutions, redshifts, and mass bins. We validate the final mock catalogues by comparing them to N-body halo catalogues using different N-point correlation functions. Our model produces mock halo catalogues consistent with the reference simulations, showing that this novel network is a promising way to generate mock data for upcoming wide-field surveys due to its computational efficiency. Moreover, we find that the network can be trained on approximate overdensity fields to reduce the computational cost further. We also present how the trained network parameters can be interpreted to give insights into the physics of structure formation. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of our model as well as more general requirements and pitfalls for approximate halo mock generation.</description>

      <title>A bound on thermal y-distortion of the cosmic neutrino background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the cosmic neutrino background might have a nonthermal spectrum, and investigate its effect on cosmological parameters relative to standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. As a specific model, we consider a thermal $y$-distortion, which alters the distribution function of the neutrino background by depleting the population of low-energy neutrinos and enhancing the high-energy tail. We constrain the thermal $y$-parameter of the cosmic neutrino background using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and place a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $y \leq 0.043$. The $y$-parameter increases the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, reducing the sound horizon radius and increasing the best-fit value for the Hubble constant $H_0$. We obtain an upper bound on the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 71.12\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ at $95\%$ confidence, substantially reducing the tension between CMB/BAO constraints and direct measurement of the expansion rate from Type-Ia supernovae. Including a spectral distortion also allows for a higher value of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, with a best-fit of $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 0.9720 \pm 0.0063$, and a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $n_{\mathrm{S}} \leq 0.9842$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thermal interpretation of the stochastic formalism of a slow-rolling scalar field in de Sitter (dS) is given. We construct a correspondence between Hubble patches of dS and particles living in another space called an abstract space. By assuming a dual description of scalar fields and classical mechanics in the abstract space, we show that the stochastic evolution of the infrared part of the field is equivalent to the Brownian motion in the abstract space filled with a heat bath of massless particles. The 1st slow-roll condition and the Hubble expansion are also reinterpreted in the abstract space as the speed of light and a transfer of conserved energy, respectively. Inspired by this, we sketch quantum emergent particles, which may realize the Hubble expansion by an exponential particle production. This gives another meaning of dS entropy as entropy per Hubble volume.</description>

      <title>Power spectra and circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves with parity and Lorentz violations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violations of parity and Lorentz symmetries in gravity can change the propagating properties of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmological background, which can arise from a large number of parity- and Lorentz-violating theories. In this paper, through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from the standard GW propagation in general relativity, we study both the parity- and Lorentz-violating effects on the power spectra and the polarization of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) during the slow-roll inflation. To this end, we calculate explicitly the power spectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically by using the uniform asymptotic approximation. It is shown that the new contributions to power spectra contain two parts, one from the parity-violating terms and the other from the Lorentz-violating terms. While the Lorentz-violating terms can only affect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce nonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand polarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes.</description>

      <title>21 Balmer Jump Street: The Nebular Continuum at High Redshift and Implications for the Bright Galaxy Problem, UV Continuum Slopes, and Early Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, from both a theoretical and observational perspective, the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, IMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta\lesssim-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.</description>
