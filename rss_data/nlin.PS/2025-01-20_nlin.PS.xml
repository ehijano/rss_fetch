      <title>Spatial localization in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo model, originally introduced to study neural dynamics, has since found applications across diverse fields, including cardiology and biology. However, the formation and bifurcation structure of spatially localized states in this model remain underexplored. In this work, we present a detailed bifurcation analysis of such localized structures in one spatial dimension in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We demonstrate that these localized states undergo a smooth transition between standard and collapsed homoclinic snaking as the system shifts from pattern-uniform to uniform-uniform bistability. Additionally, we explore the oscillatory dynamics exhibited by these states when varying the time-scale separation and diffusion coefficient. Our study leverages a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to uncover the stability and dynamic regimes of spatially localized structures, offering new insights into the mechanisms governing spatial localization in this widely used model system.</description>

      <title>Excitable dynamics and coral reef formation: A simple model of macro-scale structure development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that key aspects of the dynamical behavior of coral reefs at the macro scale, which evolve over time scales of centuries, can be accurately described using a model that integrates a few fundamental ecological and physical mechanisms. The model displays excitable behavior generating, among other dynamical regimes, traveling pulses and waves, which result in the formation of spatial structures resembling those observed in real reefs, without involving a classical pattern formation mechanism, like the Turing scenario. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the bifurcations exhibited by the model as a function of the two most ecologically significant parameters. This establishes the groundwork for using the presented model as a tool to explain coral reef formation.</description>

      <title>Beyond-all-order asymptotics for homoclinic snaking of localised patterns in reaction-transport systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially localised stationary patterns of arbitrary wide spatial extent emerge from subcritical Turing bifurcations in one-dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. They lie on characteristic bifurcation curves that oscillate around a Maxwell point in a homoclinic snaking phenomenon. Here, a generalisation of the exponential asymptotics method by Chapman \&amp; Kozyreff is developed to provide leading-order expressions for the width of the snaking region close to a Turing bifurcation's super/sub-critical transition in arbitrary $n$-component reaction-diffusion systems. First, general expressions are provided for the regular asymptotic approximation of the Maxwell point, which depends algebraically on the parametric distance from the codimension-two super/sub-critical Turing bifurcation. Then, expressions are derived for the width of the snaking, which is exponentially small in the same distance. The general theory is developed using a vectorised form of regular and exponential asymptotic expansions for localised patterns, which are matched at a Stokes line. Detailed calculations for a particular example are algebraically cumbersome, depend sensitively on the form of the reaction kinetics, and rely on the summation of a weakly convergent series obtained via optimal truncation. Nevertheless, the process can be automated, and code is provided that carries out the calculations automatically, only requiring the user to input the model, and the values of parameters at a codimension-two bifurcation. The general theory also applies to higher-order equations, including those that can be recast as a reaction-diffusion system. The theory is illustrated by comparing numerical computations of localised patterns in two versions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation with different nonlinearities, and versions of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>
