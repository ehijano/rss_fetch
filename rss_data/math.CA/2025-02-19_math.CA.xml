      <title>Analytic Versus Algebraic Density of Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under very mild conditions on a measure $\mu$ on the interval $[0,\infty)$, the span of $\{x^k\}_{k=n}^{\infty}$ is dense in $L^2(\mu)$ for any $n=0,1,\ldots$. We present two different proofs of this result, one based on the density index of Berg and Thill and one based on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)\oplus \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. Using the index of determinacy of Berg and Dur\'an we prove that if the measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ has infinite index of determinacy then the polynomial ideal $R(x)\mathbb{C}[x]$ is dense in $L^2(\mu)$ for any polynomial $R$ with zeros having no mass under $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Connections between $\mathcal{S}$-operators and restriction estimates for spheres over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new operator, $\mathcal{S}$, which is closely related to the restriction problem for spheres in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. The $\mathcal{S}$ operator is considered as a specific operator that maps functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ to functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^{d+1}$. We explore a relationship between the boundedness of the $\mathcal{S}$ operator and the restriction estimate for spheres in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. Consequently, using this relationship, we prove that the $L^2$ restriction conjectures for spheres hold in all dimensions when the test functions are restricted to homogeneous functions of degree zero.</description>

      <title>The Change of Variable Formula Integrals, do they have equal value?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that the two integrals in the Change of Variable Formula for the unidimensional Riemann integral are finite, one can ask if they have equal value. We give an answer to this question. The proof is very easy to follow and to keep in mind. Two examples are given.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Oscillation Estimates Arising in Pointwise Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish essentially optimal $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-estimates for variational variants of the maximal Fourier multiplier operators considered by Bourgain in his work on pointwise convergence of polynomial ergodic averages. We do so by addressing a simpler operator and then applying cheap interpolation methods. While elementary, these methods are strong enough to address the issue of pointwise convergence along fractional parts of real-variable polynomials in the regime $2 &lt; p \leq \infty$, namely the pointwise convergence of \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor P(n) \rfloor} f, \; \; \; f \in L^p(X,\mu), \ P \in \mathbb{R}[\cdot] \] for any $\sigma$-finite measure space equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T:X \to X$.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-estimates for singular integral operators along codimension one subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study maximal directional singular integral operators in $ \mathbb{R}^n $ given by a H\"ormander--Mihlin multiplier on an $ (n-1)$-dimensional subspace and acting trivially in the perpendicular direction. The subspace is allowed to depend measurably on the first $ n-1 $ variables of $ \mathbb{R}^n $. Assuming the subspace to be non degenerate in the sense that it is away from a cone around $e_n$ and the function $ f $ to be frequency supported in a cone away from $ \mathbb{R}^{n-1} $, we prove $ L^p $-bounds for these operators for $ p &gt; 3/2 $. If we assume, additionally, that $ \widehat{f} $ is supported in a single frequency band, we are able to extend the boundedness range to $ p &gt;1 $. The non-degeneracy assumption cannot in general be removed, even in the band-limited case.</description>

      <title>On Preserving or Reversing Higher-Order Unimodality and Convexity by Sign-Regular Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates preserving and reversing unimodality and convexity properties for sequences under transformations defined by sign-regular kernels. It is shown that these transformations only preserve these properties if the kernels are totally positive of order three or their additive inverse is totally negative of order three. In contrast, these transformations reverse these properties if the underlying kernel is totally negative or if its additive inverse is a totally positive kernel, both of order three. Furthermore, these results are extended to higher-order convex and multimodal sequences. These findings, which expand upon Karlin's earlier results on convexity, form the basis for deriving sufficient conditions for the preservation or reversal of higher-order convexity or generalised unimodality of a quotient of sequences, where both the numerator and denominator are transformations by the same sign-regular kernel.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the rod cross section shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct method for solving the inverse problem of determining the shape of the cross section of a rod is proposed. The method is based on Neumann series of Bessel functions representations for solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations. The first coefficient of the representation is sufficient for the recovery of the unknown function. A system of linear algebraic equations for finding this coefficient is obtained. The proposed method leads to an efficient numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Topological Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture and strong measure zero sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the topological version of the Erd\H{o}s Similarity conjecture introduced previously by Gallagher, Lai and Weber. We show that a set is topologically universal on ${\mathbb R}$ if and only if it is of strong measure zero. As a result of the fact that the Borel conjecture is independent of the \textsf{ZFC} axiomatic set theory, the existence of an uncountable topologically universal set is independent of the \textsf{ZFC}. Moreover, our results can also be generalized to locally compact Polish groups ${\mathbb G}$. Returning to the measure side, we pose Full-Measure universal Erd\H{o}s Similarity Conjecture with strongly meager sets via the duality of measure and category.</description>

      <title>Middle Laplace transform and middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a transformation of linear Pfaffian systems, which we call the middle Laplace transform, as a formulation of the Laplace transform from the perspective of Katz theory. While the definition of the middle Laplace transform is purely algebraic, its categorical interpretation is also provided. We then show the fundamental properties (invertibility, irreducibility) of the middle Laplace transform. As an application of the middle Laplace transform, we define the middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities. This gives a generalization of Haraoka's middle convolution, which was defined for linear Pfaffian systems with logarithmic singularities. The fundamental properties (additivity, irreducibility) of the middle convolution follow from the properties of the middle Laplace transform.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of symmetric Kubo-Ando operator means satisfying Moln\'ar's weak associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of weakly associative means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means. This class, which includes the geometric mean, was first introduced and studied in L. Moln\'ar, ``Characterizations of certain means of positive operators," Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166, where he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the Moln\'ar class of means) in terms of the properties of their representing operator monotone functions. Moln\'ar's paper leaves open the problem of determining if the geometric mean is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give a negative answer to this question by constructing an order-preserving bijection between this class and a class of real measurable odd periodic functions bounded in absolute value by $1/2$. Each member of the latter class defines a Molnar mean by an explicit exponential-integral representation. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Moln\'ar class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Moln\'ar means that are not the geometric mean. Our analysis also shows how to modify Moln\'ar's original characterization so that the geometric mean is the only one satisfying the requisite set of properties.</description>

      <title>A positivity conjecture for a quotient of $q$-binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. Moreover, we move ahead to extend our conjecture to D. Stanton's fake Gaussian sequences. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.</description>
