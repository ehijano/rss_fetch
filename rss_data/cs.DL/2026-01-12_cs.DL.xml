      <title>A Stock-Flow Framework for Editorial Board Dynamics: The Case of Economics Journals, 1866-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the editorial boards of scholarly journals has predominantly relied on static, cross-sectional data, focusing on their composition or interlocking editorships at single points in time. To address this gap, a formal stock-flow framework is developed for analyzing the longitudinal dynamics of editorial boards. The model integrates three interconnected layers: journal demographics, the dynamics of editorial positions, and the dynamics of board members. This framework is applied to the Gatekeepers of Economics Longitudinal Database (GOELD), which contains annual snapshots of editorial boards for approximately 1,700 economics journals from 1866 to 2006 (by decade), plus the years 2012 and 2019. The period until 1946 was characterized by small-scale: few journals and compact editorial communities. The decade from 1946 to 1956 marked the shift toward a ''big science'' model, initiating an era of expansionary growth fueled primarily by the founding of new journals. The contemporary period (2006-2019) appears to represent a structural break, characterized by low flux and more stable and more closed editorial communities. The results shows that the proposed framework enables a dynamic, long-term analysis of how journals and their gatekeeping systems evolve, grow, and structure themselves.</description>
