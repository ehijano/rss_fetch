      <title>Imprints of asymptotic freedom on confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Polyakov loop correlator in the confining phase of large $N$ Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions. It can be computed by summing over the exchange of closed flux tubes winding around the thermal cycle. At short separations, the leading divergence is controlled by perturbation theory. Combining these two facts allows us to determine the asymptotic spectral density of string states contributing to the correlator. This sharply relates the weakly-coupled UV of the gauge theory to the dynamics of highly energetic flux tubes. Then, in a toy integrable setting, we explore how this can bound the scattering data of the Goldstone modes on top of a long string. We derive a bound on the asymptotic behavior of the reflection amplitude of Goldstones against the flux tube boundary sourced by the Polyakov line, and rule out an asymptotically linear phase shift for the S-matrix. Along the way, we discuss how causality can impose bounds on thermodynamic quantities, and show how the positivity of time delays follows from unitarity and analyticity of $2d$ massless elastic S-matrices. We include a review on reflection amplitudes, and their computation in the theory of long effective strings.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to Matrix Models and String Theories: The Local Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.</description>

      <title>A Surface Integrand for the Inverse KLT Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a loop-level generalization of the inverse string theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) kernel: the planar inverse KLT integrand. The integrand is defined constructively via a novel Berends-Giele-like recursion that exposes the inverse KLT kernel as the simplest toy model of a ``stringy amplitude''. We show that, to all loop orders, the inverse KLT integrand is structurally equivalent to integrands in the cubic scalar tr$\phi^3$ theory. This simplicity is obscured in the conventional Feynman diagram approach, where the inverse KLT integrand receives contributions from an infinity of infinite towers of contact interactions. The inverse KLT integrand is a rational function of stringified kinematic variables and is naturally defined on the kinematic surface proposed by Arkani-Hamed et al.. It provides an elementary analogue of the surfacehedron integrand for the tr$\phi^3$ theory involving only scalar resonances and unifies the scattering of cubic scalars and pions in the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) to all loop orders via kinematic $\alpha'$-shifts.</description>

      <title>Toward a mathematically consistent theory of semiclassical gravity or, How to have your wormholes and factorize, too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review three well known inconsistencies in the standard mathematical formulation of semiclassical gravity: the factorization problem, the information problem, and the closed universe problem. Building upon recent work, we explore how modifying the holographic dictionary may provide the necessary freedom to resolve these three problems in a unified manner while maintaining more well established aspects of the standard correspondence. Using the modified holographic dictionary as a scaffolding, we propose a program for constructing an `extended' semiclassical gravitational path integral which (i) is manifestly factorizing, (ii) computes a von Neumann entropy which satisfies the Page curve, and (iii) incorporates new operators that create closed baby universe states. Our construction may be interpreted as imposing a semiclassical version of background independence/a no global symmetry condition, defining a modified large N limit, preparing an ensemble of dual theories, or enforcing observer rules using gravitational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Learning the S-matrix from data: Rediscovering gravity from gauge theory via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modern machine-learning methods can autonomously reconstruct several flagship analytic structures in scattering amplitudes directly from numerical on-shell data. In particular, we show that the Kawai--Lewellen--Tye (KLT) relations can be rediscovered using symbolic regression applied to colour-ordered Yang--Mills amplitudes with Mandelstam invariants as input features. Using standard feature-selection techniques, specifically column-pivoted QR factorisation, we simultaneously recover the Kleiss--Kuijf and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson (BCJ) relations, identifying a minimal basis of partial amplitudes without any group-theoretic input. We obtain the tree-level KLT relations with high numerical accuracy up to five external legs, using only minimal theoretical priors, and we comment on the obstacles to generalising the method to higher multiplicity. Our results establish symbolic regression as a practical tool for exploring the analytic structure of the scattering-amplitude landscape, and suggests a general data-driven strategy for uncovering hidden relations in general theories. For comparison, we benchmark this general approach with a recently introduced neural-network based method.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Quantized Angular Momentum of Rotating Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-topological solitons, such as Q-balls, may contribute to the cosmological dark matter. The formation and evolution of Q-balls in the early universe requires an understanding of solitons with nonzero angular momentum. We derive (rather than assume) the schematic form of the scalar field configurations that produce rotating Q-balls, which produce their well known quantized angular momentum. This analysis leads to additional insight into the properties of these rotating solitons, including a method for computing their characteristic angular velocity. By considering rotating solitons in two spatial dimensions, we investigate these attributes concretely. We develop analytical approximations for the solitons and their defining quantities. We show that they agree with numerical results and exhibit the general properties of rotating solitons.</description>

      <title>To boost or not to boost, that's the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Or should we talk about dS/CFT correspondence or dS/SFT correspondence in cosmological correlators? In non-unitary field theories -- which are conjectured to be dual to cosmological correlators -- scale invariance does not necessarily imply full conformal invariance. While general relativity predicts the emergence of conformal invariance (or boost symmetry in the bulk), various modified theories of gravity suggest only scale invariance, characterized by the absence of bulk boost symmetry. We demonstrate this distinction using Einstein-Aether theory as a canonical example.</description>

      <title>Compact Q-balls and Q-shells within a $CP^N$ Skyrme-Faddeev type model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While $CP^N$ models with analytic potentials are known to support finite-energy compact Q-ball and Q-shell solutions, their behavior in more complex Lagrangian frameworks remains a subject of active research. This work explores these non-topological structures within an extended Skyrme-Faddeev-type model that incorporates quartic derivative terms. In this context, harmonic time dependence and the presence of quartic terms constitute two independent stabilization mechanisms that allow the configurations to circumvent Derrick's scaling argument. We investigate the necessary conditions for the existence of these solutions and analyze the influence of quartic terms on the properties of the resulting compactons, specifically examining the $E(Q)$ relationship between energy and Noether charge. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stability and characteristics of compact boson stars within $CP^N$ models featuring higher-order derivative terms.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Schwinger effect from Hawking radiation in Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m black holes via entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charged black hole can emit charged particles via two independent mechanisms: the Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, which are intertwined in the radiation spectrum. In this paper, we will show that the two effects can be distinguished by analyzing the entanglement entropy carried by the produced particle pairs. Explicitly, we apply the island formula to the near extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m (RN) black hole to calculate the total entanglement entropy of the radiation. Meanwhile we use the heat kernel method to calculate the entanglement entropy of charged particle pairs produced solely from the Schwinger effect. By comparing with the total entanglement entropy, we obtain the entanglement entropy produced purely from the Hawking radiation. Consequently, the two effects are distinguishable in near extremal RN black holes after the Page time. Furthermore, we also employ the brick wall model and the Pauli-Villars regularization to derive the entanglement entropy from the Schwinger effect, which gives a slightly different result with that obtained from the heat kernel method.</description>

      <title>Generalized GMP Algebra for Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Fluids of Extended Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for three-dimensional quantum Hall fluids of extended objects (quasi-strings) in the presence of a strong three-form background field associated with a bundle gerbe. In the strong-field regime, fast internal dynamics is frozen and the low-energy kinematics is governed by generalized guiding-center variables consisting of vectorial and tensorial coordinates. We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The required absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity has been used to imply that all non-compact gauge theories are in the swampland. This argument stems from the idea that non-compact gauge symmetries always seem to be accompanied by global symmetries that cannot be broken with a finite number of fields. In this work, we investigate whether these symmetries can be broken by an uncountable infinity of fields. We find that the symmetries can be broken, but as soon as we add these fields the EFT breaks down and in some cases decompactifies to a higher-dimensional theory without the non-compact gauge symmetry, akin to undoing a Kaluza-Klein reduction on a non-compact space. We make various comments on the species scale, free parameters, and the Weak Gravity Conjecture along the way.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic phase transitions of a four-dimensional charged anti-de Sitter black hole endowed with a non-minimal coupling of the form $F^{\alpha\beta}F^{\gamma\lambda}R_{\alpha\gamma\beta\lambda}$. Using perturbative methods, we derive a consistent black hole solution and analyze its thermodynamics through both conventional equilibrium techniques and a topological defect classification approach. The system displays van der Waals-like critical behavior, with a swallow-tail structure in the free energy and distinct phase branches. The topological analysis independently confirms the existence of critical points and classifies the system within the universal topological scheme for black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>May Negative Mass Objects exist in the sky?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture the possibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) existing in the sky. It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties.</description>

      <title>Horizon-Brightened Acceleration Radiation and Optical Signatures of Generic Regular Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.</description>

      <title>Thermal Bhabha scattering under the influence of non-hermiticity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bhabha scattering process within the framework of non-Hermitian QED at finite temperature. In this theory, the hermiticity condition, typically required in quantum field theory to ensure the reality of physical observables, is replaced by the condition of unbroken $PT$-symmetry which favors the introduction of an axial mass and a vector-axial gauge coupling. Using the Thermofield Dynamics formalism, we derive and comprehensively analyze the thermal differential cross section for the Bhabha scattering. Furthermore, we explore the high-energy limit of the scattering amplitude and establish constraints upon the axial coupling constant, offering valuable insights into the system's behavior under extreme conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the gluon transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) operator structure of back-to-back quark-antiquark dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at arbitrary Bjorken-x to twist-3 accuracy. Working at leading order in the strong coupling and in the kinematic regime where the transverse momentum imbalance of the jets is much smaller than their individual transverse momenta, we perform a systematic gradient expansion of the quark propagator in a background gluon field. This expansion organizes multiple interactions with the target in terms of longitudinal Wilson lines and gauge-invariant field-strength insertions, yielding a TMD description valid beyond the strict high-energy eikonal (x -&gt; 0) approximation. We obtain explicit cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons, identifying all contributing gluon TMD operators up to twist-3, including structures involving F_+-, F_ij, and three-gluon correlators. The full longitudinal phase associated with Bjorken-x is retained throughout. In the small-x limit, our results reproduce the known sub-eikonal expressions obtained in the Color Glass Condensate framework, establishing a direct connection between the general-x TMD expansion and high-energy factorization. We further reduce the operator basis using equations of motion, minimizing the number of independent nonperturbative matrix elements entering the cross section. This work provides a systematic foundation for extending TMD analyses of dijet production beyond leading twist, establishing a unified operator framework valid at arbitrary Bjorken x that smoothly interpolates between moderate- and small-x descriptions of gluon TMDs.</description>

      <title>Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames.
  We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.
  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \begin{equation} T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}{f(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}\,,\qquad T_0=\frac{\kappa_0}{2\pi}\,, \end{equation} where $\kappa_0$ is the classical surface gravity.
  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\propto E p^2/E_{\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\star)\simeq T_0(1-\frac{\eta}{2}E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})$ for $\eta&gt;0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\star)=T_0$).
  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the gravitational dust collapse of the LQG-inspired effective asymmetric bounce model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational dust collapse within an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG)-inspired model exhibiting an asymmetric bounce in the marginally bound case. This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at boundary terms in Einstein-Hilbert gravity via an initial value variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key tenet of general relativity is the dynamical nature of space-time, ideally represented as an initial value problem. Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.</description>

      <title>Displacement memory in regular black hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Displacement memory, induced by a wave pulse in a regular black hole spacetime, is studied using geodesic (timelike) separation and geodesic deviation. The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIc. Detectability with non-standard primordial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.</description>

      <title>Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate in detail the thermodynamic properties of a spherically symmetric ModMax-AdS black hole sourced by a global monopole within the Kalb-Ramond gravity. We derive the key thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and analyze how the geometric parameters influence these physical quantities. The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters. We also obtain the inversion temperature and demonstrate that the minimum inversion temperature is modified by the space-time parameters. In addition, the sparsity of Hawking radiation and thermal fluctuations of the system are investigated, highlighting the effects of the parameters on the entropy corrections. Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate critical restricted solid-on-solid models associated to Dynkin diagrams of type $A$, $D$ and $E$, with fixed, periodic and twisted periodic boundary conditions. These models are endowed with an action of the diagrams of the Temperley-Lieb category. For each model, we obtain the decomposition of the state space as a direct sum of irreducible modules over the Temperley-Lieb algebra $\mathsf{TL}_N(\beta)$ or its periodic incarnation $\mathsf{\mathcal EPTL}_N(\beta)$. This allows us to recover the known conformal partition functions for these models in the continuum scaling limit.
  For each irreducible factor arising in the decompositions, we define an associated local operator on the lattice, which behaves like a connectivity operator. Using knowledge from the Temperley-Lieb representation theory at roots of unity, we show that these operators satisfy certain linear difference relations, which are lattice counterparts of the singular-vector relations in conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deformation of Heisenberg algebra induces among other consequences a loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Therefore, these operators are not Hermitian, nor is the Hamiltonian operator built from them. In the present paper, we propose a position deformation of Heisenberg algebra with both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties. By using a pseudo-similarity transformation to the non-Hermitian operators, we prove their Hermiticity with a suitable positive-definite pseudo-metric operator. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these pseudo-Hermitian operators. Finally, we study the eigenvalue problem of a free particle in this deformed space and we show that this deformation curved the quantum levels allowing particles to jump from one state to another with low energy transitions.</description>

Abstract: We uncover a striking connection between conformal blocks and fractional calculus. By employing a modified form of half-derivates, we derived explicitly the exact form of the three-dimensional conformal block, expressed as the product of two hypergeometric 4F3 functions. This result provides a rigorous proof of Hogervorst's formula, conjectured nearly a decade ago. Furthermore, we demonstrate its implications for the conformal bootstrap, potentially leading to new analytical techniques and numerical tools that deepen our understanding of conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Veneziano amplitude describing the tree-level scattering of four open superstrings is expected to be consistent with unitarity in ten spacetime dimensions. While this follows indirectly from the no-ghost theorem, a direct proof at the level of the amplitude has only been found for $D\leq 6$. In this article, we close this gap by providing a complete proof for the partial-wave positivity of the Veneziano amplitude in $D\leq 10$, derived directly from its definition in terms of the Euler beta function. We also demonstrate that this proof can be modified to show positivity of a wider family of amplitudes relevant to the $S$-matrix bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we first heuristically construct the charges corresponding to the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. We refer to these as the large chiral charges, and to the chiral transformation they generate as the large chiral transformations. Then, showing that these large chiral charges can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we obtain the anomaly equation associated with these large chiral transformations. Subsequently, considering the one-loop diagrams of the fermionic field coupled to multiple classical gauge fields (which constitute the effective action of the model in this study with regard to the gauge field), we perform an axialization. Then, defining the BRS transformations for the large U(1) gauge symmetry (we refer to these as the large BRS transformations), we perform these transformations to these axialized one-loop diagrams, and demonstrate that the anomaly equations mentioned above can be derived by evaluating these diagrams. We further confirm that these anomaly equations can be derived using the Fujikawa method. Finally, we discuss the breaking of unitarity and the low-energy effective model associated with the large chiral anomaly in this study, and comment on potential future developments arising from them.</description>

Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <title>Finite Cut-Off Holography and the DBI Counter-Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate some very special features of the Dirac-Born-Infeld--like (DBI) gravitational counter-term in AdS$_4$ spacetime, in the context of holography with a sharp radial cut-off. We show that the three-sphere partition function is not only independent of a constant radial cut-off, but also remains unchanged under deformations of the cut-off surface. We also consider the renormalized holographic entanglement entropy for an equatorial Ryu-Takayanagi surface with a cut-off with an arbitrary shape and show that it can also be independent of the cut-off under a special condition. We also numerically study the behavior of the renormalized entropy with different counter-terms and relate the results to monotonicity properties under holographic renormalization group flow. The DBI counter-term is always seen to be associated with integrating out fewer degrees of freedom compared to other counter-terms.</description>

Abstract: Low-energy effective theories provide the natural description of four-dimensional physics in higher-dimensional geometries, where the imprint of the bulk appears as parameters of the lower dimensional theory. Motivated by the recent progress in the first-order thermodynamic formulation of modified gravity theories, we investigate the thermodynamics of effective theories in braneworld scenarios and thereby the attractor mechanism towards general relativity in such theories. We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model where the low-energy theory on either brane is of scalar-tensor nature with the extra-dimensional radion playing the role of the scalar. We study the thermodynamic implications of a non-vanishing gravitational contribution to the radion potential, and further explore the dynamics in the presence of a bulk stabilizing field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe tree-level soft theorems for Chern-Simons QED and QCD in 4+1 dimensions. Soft theorems have been studied in various context in the past. The universal behavior of the leading and subleading soft theorems is understood as a consequence of the local on-shell gauge invariance of the scattering amplitudes. Chern-Simons terms are gauge-invariant only up to a boundary term. Hence, they make for an interesting case to study the relationship between gauge invariance and soft theorems. In this paper, we show that the subleading soft theorems in QED and QCD get corrected when Chern-Simons terms are introduced and also derive those corrections. We start with a discussion on soft theorems as a consequence of gauge invariance. Then we move on to derive the Chern-Simons vertices. Finally, we calculate the correction to soft theorems due to the addition of Chern-Simons terms for both QED and QCD.</description>

Abstract: The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. The entanglement entropy grows inside the causal cone, and it saturates due to screening/dephasing in the finite inhomogeneous chain. In dipole-dipole collision, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of boundaries subject to conformal boundary conditions, in which the conformal class of the boundary metric is kept fixed. In Einstein gravity, the trace of the extrinsic curvature is also fixed at the boundary. Here we generalize this boundary condition with the appropriate higher curvature correction. We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Saha et al. (2025) [1], we utilize the deformed light-cone formalism to investigate the Carrollian version of a complex vector field theory. We find that after applying the null-reduction procedure and the Carrollian limit c $\to$ 0, the "-" null-direction and spatial components of the parent vector field decouple completely into independent scalar fields, while the "+" null-direction component vanishes. We carefully derive and demonstrate the process by which the energy-momentum tensor degrades from the Lorentzian symmetry case to the non-relativistic scenario, and point out that the secondary constraint of the original parent theory will play a crucial role in the derivation of the Carrollian generators. As expected, the resulting generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations. Furthermore, we derived Weinberg's famous leading Soft Photon Theorem roughly and schematically via celestial holography and discussed the holographic indications for conformal Carrollian field theories in the infrared limit.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description>

Abstract: There is growing interest in viable quantum theories with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, but a formulation of transition matrix elements consistent with positivity and perturbative unitarity has so far proved elusive. This Letter provides such a formulation, which relies crucially on the ability to span the state space in such a way that the interaction and energy eigenstates are orthonormal with respect to the same positive-definite inner product. We apply this non-Hermitian approach to two-neutrino flavour oscillations, and show how it can accommodate the seesaw mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Spin-1 particles, is a fundamental bound state for the two quarks, and play a crucial role in elucidating the electromagnetic properties within the realm of hadronic physics. Their intrinsic relativistic nature mandates a quantum field theory (QFT) framework for a comprehensive analysis. In this investigation, we employ both the instant form of QFT and light-front quantum field theory (LFQFT) as our theoretical tools. While conventional LFQFT approaches predominantly focus on the plus component of the electromagnetic current to extract the properties of spin-1 vector particles, our study extends this analysis by systematically incorporating the minus component as well. Our findings demonstrate that achieving a rigorous equivalence between these distinct current components necessitates the inclusion of nonvalence terms within the electromagnetic current operator. This crucial inclusion serves to restore manifest covariance and ensures a robust consistency with the results independently

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, Majorana strong zero modes and SPT phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: A perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\L$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving higher $R^2$ values, lower mean squared error, and lower AIC/BIC scores than those of the $\L$CDM model. Despite identified methodological limitations, these findings establish an exploratory framework for incorporating finite-temperature quantum corrections into precision cosmology and open new avenues for data-driven parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data. Although further work is required, our results suggest that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects may play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Secluded Dark Composites and Remnant Binding Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may freeze-out and undergo composite assembly while decoupled from the Standard Model. In this secluded composite scenario, while individual dark matter particles may be too weakly-coupled to detect, the assembled composite can potentially be detected since its effective coupling scales with number of constituents. We examine models and observables for secluded composites, and in particular we investigate the cosmological abundance of the composite binding field, which is generated during freeze-out annihilation and secluded composite assembly. This binding field could be discovered as a new relativistic species in the early universe or through later interactions as a subdominant dark component.</description>

      <title>Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an explicit correspondence between continuum topological field theory and microscopic lattice constructions of three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders. While Wilson operators defined by gauge-field holonomies represent topological excitations at long distances, we explicitly construct microscopic lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, derive their fusion and shrinking rules microscopically, and show how non-Abelian shrinking channels are selectively controlled through the internal degrees of freedom of loop creation operators. Crucially, we demonstrate that the lattice shrinking rules satisfy the \textit{fusion-shrinking consistency} relations previously identified at long distances, thereby establishing these relations as a general, microscopically verifiable principle. Moreover, by computing the complete excitation spectrum alongside all fusion and shrinking data microscopically, we establish a correspondence between the $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and gauge group $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. Through the precise microscopic construction of the $BF+AAB$ field theory, this work definitively addresses the long-standing skepticism regarding its microscopic realizability, which has persisted over the past years. Finally, our work bridges the gap between theories at long and short distances, taking a crucial step toward a more complete microscopic construction of topological data previously identified at long distances, including braiding, pentagon relations, and fusion-shrinking hexagon relations. This progress holds the potential to deepen our understanding of quantum matter across all length scales and foster collaboration between researchers from diverse fields and approaches.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of the renormalisation group running of quark and fermion mixing matrices in the Standard Model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalisation group running of fermion mixing matrices in the Standard model and beyond is studied. For the massless 1-loop running with three generations six fixed points are found. Their associated anomalous dimension matrices are calculated and the nature of each fixed point, whether attractive, repulsive or mixed, is determined. An argument is given that the fixed points found at 1-loop must remain fixed points to all orders in perturbation theory and even non-perturbatively, as they are associated with certain differential geometric properties of vector fields on the space of mixing matrices. With $N_g$ dark or sterile neutrinos there is a multiple of $N_g!$ fixed points of the fermion mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Positive Genus Pairs from Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra, which are certain semi-algebraic sets in the Grassmannian, are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. Beyond a small number of special cases, this conjecture is still open. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology via genus zero pairs. We give short proofs that the amplituhedron gives rise to a genus zero pair in the cases when it is known to be a positive geometry. However, in the general case we show that amplituhedra inside the Grassmannian give rise to pairs of strictly positive genus. We provide an explicit example of a genus one pair arising from a positive geometry in projective space, showing that having genus zero is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry. Finally, we show that this positive geometry still gives rise to a genus zero pair in a different ambient variety.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>
