      <title>Exploring single-photon recoil on free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in time-resolved electron and photon detection enable novel correlative measurements of electrons and their associated cathodoluminescence (CL) photons within a transmission electron microscope. These studies are pivotal for understanding the underlying physics in coherent CL processes. We present experimental investigations of energy-momentum conservation and the corresponding dispersion relation on the single particle level, achieved through coincidence detection of electron-photon pairs. This not only enables unprecedented clarity in detecting weak signals otherwise obscured by non-radiative processes but also provides a new experimental pathway to investigate momentum-position correlations to explore entanglement within electron-photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics is a promising candidate for obtaining a quantum computational advantage. However, linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some computations require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. We obtain the invariants by projecting the density operator of the state onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. The conservation of the invariants gives necessary conditions for exact and approximate state preparation with passive linear optics: if input and output states have different invariants, it will be impossible to design a linear optical experiment that evolves one into the other or a sufficiently close one. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare entangled states useful for quantum information, like Bell or NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to take into account the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <title>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain characterized by a chaotic yet nonthermal phase. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the R\'enyi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</description>

      <title>Quantum integration of decay rates at second order in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first quantum computation of a total decay rate in high-energy physics at second order in perturbative quantum field theory. This work underscores the confluence of two recent cutting-edge advances. On the one hand, the quantum integration algorithm Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which efficiently decomposes the target function into its Fourier series through a quantum neural network before quantumly integrating the corresponding Fourier components. On the other hand, causal unitary in the loop-tree duality (LTD), which exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in LTD to coherently generate all contributions with different numbers of final-state particles to a scattering or decay process, leading to singularity-free integrands that are well suited for Fourier decomposition. We test the performance of the quantum algorithm with benchmark decay rates in a quantum simulator and in quantum hardware, and find accurate theoretical predictions in both settings.</description>

      <title>Ground states of strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers using ab initio downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving accurate many-body Hamiltonians including strong correlations, representing a subspace of interest of a material, using density functional theory calculations as a starting point. However, the solution of these material-specific models can scale exponentially on classical computers, constituting a challenge. Here we propose that utilizing quantum computers for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians yields an accurate description of the ground state properties of strongly-correlated systems, while circumventing the exponential scaling problem. We demonstrate this for diverse strongly-correlated materials by combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, correctly predicting the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. By utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers we are able to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum annealing simulation with tensor networks and belief propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing and quantum approximate optimization algorithms hold a great potential to speed-up optimization problems. This could be game-changing for a plethora of applications. Yet, in order to hope to beat classical solvers, quantum circuits must scale up to sizes and performances much beyond current hardware. In that quest, intense experimental effort has been recently devoted to optimizations on 3-regular graphs, which are computationally hard but experimentally relatively amenable. However, even there, the amount and quality of quantum resources required for quantum solvers to outperform classical ones is unclear. Here, we show that quantum annealing for 3-regular graphs can be classically simulated even at scales of 1000 qubits and 5000000 two-qubit gates with all-to-all connectivity. To this end, we develop a graph tensor-network quantum annealer (GTQA) able of high-precision simulations of Trotterized circuits of near-adiabatic evolutions. Based on a recently proposed belief-propagation technique for tensor canonicalization, GTQA is equipped with re-gauging and truncation primitives that keep approximation errors small in spite of the circuits generating significant amounts of entanglement. As a result, even with a maximal bond dimension as low as 4, GTQA produces solutions competitive with those of state-of-the-art classical solvers. For non-degenerate instances, the unique solution can be read out from the final reduced single-qubit states. In contrast, for degenerate problems, such as MaxCut, we introduce an approximate measurement simulation algorithm for graph tensor-network states. On one hand, our findings showcase the potential of GTQA as a powerful quantum-inspired optimizer. On the other hand, they considerably raise the bar required for experimental demonstrations of quantum speed-ups in combinatorial optimizations.</description>

      <title>Constructing Noise-Robust Quantum Gates via Pontryagin's Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable quantum information technologies depend on precise actuation and techniques to mitigate the effects of undesired disturbances such as environmental noise and imperfect calibration. In this work, we present a general framework based in geometric optimal control theory to synthesize smooth control pulses for implementing arbitrary noise-robust quantum gates. The methodology applies to generic unitary quantum dynamics with any number of qubits or energy levels, any number of control fields, and any number of disturbances, extending existing dynamical decoupling approaches that are only applicable for limited gate sets or small systems affected by one or two disturbances. The noise-suppressing controls are computed via indirect trajectory optimization based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, eliminating the need to make heuristic structural assumptions on parameterized pulse envelopes.</description>

      <title>Topological argument for robustness of coherent states in quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent states, being the closest analog to classical states of wave systems, are well known to possess special properties that set them apart from most other quantum optical states. For example, they are robust against photon loss and do not easily get entangled upon interaction with a beamsplitter, and hence are called ``pointer states'', which is often attributed to them being eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Here we provide insights into a topological argument for their robustness using two separate but exact mappings of a prototypical quantum optics model - the driven Jaynes-Cummings model. The first mapping is based on bosonization and refermionization of the Jaynes-Cummings model into the fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting zero-energy topologically protected edge states. The second mapping is based on the algebra of deformed f-oscillators. We choose these mappings to explicitly preserve the translational symmetry of the model along a Fock-state ladder basis, which is important for maintaining the symmetry-protected topology of such 1D lattices. In addition, we show that the edge state form is preserved even when certain chiral symmetry is broken, corresponding to a single-photon drive for the quantum optics model that preserves the coherent state; however, the addition of two-photon drive immediately disturbs the edge state form, as confirmed by numerical simulations of the mapped SSH model; this is expected since two-photon drive strongly perturbs the coherent state into a squeezed state. Our theory sheds light on a fundamental reason for the robustness of coherent states, both in existence and entanglement -- an underlying connection to topology.</description>

      <title>Qubit-State Purity Oscillations from Anisotropic Transverse Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of qubit-state purity in the presence of transverse noise that is anisotropically distributed in the Bloch-sphere XY plane. We perform Ramsey experiments with noise injected along a fixed laboratory-frame axis and observe oscillations in the purity at twice the qubit frequency arising from the intrinsic qubit Larmor precession. We probe the oscillation dependence on the noise anisotropy, orientation, and power spectral density, using a low-frequency fluxonium qubit. Our results elucidate the impact of transverse noise anisotropy on qubit decoherence and may be useful to disentangle charge and flux noise in superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we approach the structure of the quantum measuring system in the Euclidean regime of the classicalized holographic tensor network from the perspective of integrated information theory. As a result, we obtain the following picture of the Euclidean regime. First, there are complexes, which are independently accompanied by the level and structure of experiences, determined from the full transition probability matrix of the whole particle system. Second, the cause-effect structures of independent complexes would be directly entangled by the physical information propagation in the whole particle system. Finally, distinct full transition probability matrices of the whole particle system that exhibit the maximum cause-effect power may coexist.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Broadcast Structures from von Neumann type interaction Hamiltonians with continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS and asymptotic convergence to SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We will be focusing on the case where the system is modeled by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the operators associated with the system in the Hamiltonian have purely continuous spectrum. Such a setup yields mathematical complications that have hitherto not been addressed in the theory of SBS.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous tunneling time within the theory of time-of-arrival operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown in \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402}{\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, \textbf{108} 170402 (2012)}, that quantum tunneling is instantaneous using a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator constructed by Weyl quantization of the classical TOA. However, there are infinitely many possible quantum images of the classical TOA, leaving it unclear if one is uniquely preferred over the others. This raises the question on whether instantaneous tunneling time is simply an artifact of the chosen ordering rule. Here, we demonstrate that tunneling time vanishes for all possible quantum images of the classical arrival time, irrespective of the ordering rule between the position and momentum observables. The result still holds for TOA-operators that are constructed independent of canonical quantization, while still imposing the correct algebra defined by the time-energy canonical commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Qoncord: A Multi-Device Job Scheduling Framework for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers face challenges due to limited resources, particularly in cloud environments. Despite these obstacles, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are considered promising applications for present-day Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. VQAs require multiple optimization iterations to converge on a globally optimal solution. Moreover, these optimizations, known as restarts, need to be repeated from different points to mitigate the impact of noise. Unfortunately, the job scheduling policies for each VQA task in the cloud are heavily unoptimized. Notably, each VQA execution instance is typically scheduled on a single NISQ device. Given the variety of devices in the cloud, users often prefer higher-fidelity devices to ensure higher-quality solutions. However, this preference leads to increased queueing delays and unbalanced resource utilization.
  We propose Qoncord, an automated job scheduling framework to address these cloud-centric challenges for VQAs. Qoncordleverages the insight that not all training iterations and restarts are equal, Qoncord strategically divides the training process into exploratory and fine-tuning phases. Early exploratory iterations, more resilient to noise, are executed on less busy machines, while fine-tuning occurs on high-fidelity machines. This adaptive approach mitigates the impact of noise and optimizes resource usage and queuing delays in cloud environments. Qoncord also significantly reduces execution time and minimizes restart overheads by eliminating low-performance iterations. Thus, Qoncord offers similar solutions 17.4x faster. Similarly, it can offer 13.3% better solutions for the same time budget as the baseline.</description>

Abstract: Quantum memories could benefit many devices in quantum information processing. For a quantum to be useful in real-world applications, the quantum memory must have a high recall efficiency. Here we demonstrate an efficient (up to 80%) spin-storage quantum memory in Er:YSO, using the 4-level rephased amplified spontaneous emission protocol. We show non-classical correlations between the ASE and RASE fields produced by the quantum memory. Also, we demonstrate the storage of 70 temporal modes, with a write time of 150 us, and a storage time of 25 us. Finally, a clear pathway is presented to improve the efficiency, storage time, and mode capacity. Such a device would have applications in quantum networking and measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Controlled Counterdiabatic Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm integrating counterdiabatic (CD) protocols with quantum Lyapunov control (QLC) to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. This approach offers versatility, allowing implementation as either a digital-analog or purely digital algorithm based on selected control strategies. By examining spin-glass Hamiltonians, we illustrate how the algorithm can explore alternative paths to enhance solution outcomes compared to conventional CD techniques. This method reduces the dependence on extensive higher-order CD terms and classical optimization techniques, rendering it more suitable for existing quantum computing platforms. The combination of digital compression via CD protocols and the adaptable nature of QLC methods positions this approach as a promising candidate for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Channel Testing in Average-Case Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of testing properties of quantum channels. First, we show that testing identity to any channel $\mathcal N: \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{in}} \times d_{\mathrm{in}}} \to \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{out}} \times d_{\mathrm{out}}}$ in diamond norm distance requires $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{in}} / \varepsilon})$ queries, even in the strongest algorithmic model that admits ancillae, coherence, and adaptivity. This is due to the worst-case nature of the distance induced by the diamond norm.
  Motivated by this limitation and other theoretical and practical applications, we introduce an average-case analogue of the diamond norm, which we call the average-case imitation diamond (ACID) norm. In the weakest algorithmic model without ancillae, coherence, or adaptivity, we prove that testing identity to certain types of channels in ACID distance can be done with complexity independent of the dimensions of the channel, while for other types of channels the complexity depends on both the input and output dimensions. Building on previous work, we also show that identity to any fixed channel can be tested with $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in ACID distance and $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}}^2 d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in diamond distance in this model. Finally, we prove tight bounds on the complexity of channel tomography in ACID distance.</description>

      <title>Emergence of coupling induced transparency by tuning purely dissipative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled transitions between coupling induced transparency (CIT) and coupling induced absorption (CIA) are effects of both fundamental importance as well as potential applications in various devices. We have explored these peculiar phenomena in multi-mode coupled hybrid quantum systems by considering a tunable mode (TM) and several static modes (SMs). The individual SMs and TM are designed such that they show CIA, but upon coupling different SMs we observe a transition from CIA to CIT. Quite remarkably we are able to achieve CIT using only purely dissipative couplings, whereas it is well known that CIT appears with coherent coupling. We have developed a robust quantum theory based formalism which is able to capture the transition between CIA to CIT and have the capability to explain the inter-transition (CIT to CIA) as well as intra-transitions (CIA to CIA, CIT to CIT etc.) in a multimode hybrid quantum system all with just linear approach. A general model is developed for hybrid quantum systems having N modes. We have then explicitly described two sets of hybrid systems, the first set is of three modes, 1TM coupled with 2SMs, and the second set is of four modes, 1TM coupled with 3SMs. Later we have generalised it for hybrid quantum systems having N number of modes. The results provide a pathway for designing hybrid systems that can control the group velocity of light, offering potential applications in the fields of optical switching and quantum information technology. Our finding and formulation that in a single hybrid quantum system we can achieve controllable inter-transitions and intra-transitions of CIT/ CIA may open a tool and guidance for its application in quantum technology and quantum materials as the TMs/SMs may be well extended to other real/ quasi-particles also.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization in one-dimensional topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of synchronization, where entities exhibit stable oscillations with aligned frequencies and phases, has been detected in diverse areas of natural science. It plays a crucial role in achieving frequency locking in multiple applications such as microwave communication and signal processing. The study of synchronization in quantum systems has gained significant interest, particularly in developing robust methods for synchronizing distant objects. Here, we demonstrate that synchronization between the boundary sites of one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models can be induced through applying dissipation on the central sites. Two types of synchronization, stemming from the topological edge states, are characterized by the off-diagonal or diagonal correlations between the boundary sites. We analyze the relaxation rate to realize the synchronization and its acceleration with bulk dissipation. Remarkably, the synchronous oscillations maintain steady amplitude and frequency in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that the synchronization is robust against the perturbations in the Hamiltonian and initial states, highlighting its potential for practical implementation in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental sample-efficient quantum state tomography via parallel measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) via local measurements on reduced density matrices (LQST) is a promising approach but becomes impractical for large systems. To tackle this challenge, we developed an efficient quantum state tomography method inspired by quantum overlapping tomography [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 100401(2020)], which utilizes parallel measurements (PQST). In contrast to LQST, PQST significantly reduces the number of measurements and offers more robustness against shot noise. Experimentally, we demonstrate the feasibility of PQST in a tree-like superconducting qubit chip by designing high-efficiency circuits, preparing W states, ground states of Hamiltonians and random states, and then reconstructing these density matrices using full quantum state tomography (FQST), LQST, and PQST. Our results show that PQST reduces measurement cost, achieving fidelities of 98.68\% and 95.07\% after measuring 75 and 99 observables for 6-qubit and 9-qubit W states, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the largest density matrix of the 12-qubit W state is achieved with the similarity of 89.23\% after just measuring $243$ parallel observables, while $3^{12}=531441$ complete observables are needed for FQST. Consequently, PQST will be a useful tool for future tasks such as the reconstruction, characterization, benchmarking, and properties learning of states.</description>

      <title>Any Quantum Many-Body State under Local Dissipation will be Disentangled in Finite Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any quantum many-spin state under genetic local dissipation will be fully separable after a finite time independent of the system size. Such a sudden death of many-body entanglement occurs universally provided that there is a finite damping gap and the unique steady-state density matrix is of full rank. This result is rigorously derived by combining a state-reconstruction identity based on random measurements and the convergence bound for quantum channels. Related works and possible generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high strained diamond spin register with coherent optical link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state spin defects, such as color centers in diamond, are among the most promising candidates for scalable and integrated quantum technologies. In particular, the good optical properties of silicon-vacancy centers in diamond combined with naturally occurring and exceptionally coherent nuclear spins serve as a building block for quantum networking applications. Here, we show that leveraging an ultra-high strained silicon-vacancy center inside a nanodiamond allows us to coherently and efficiently control its electron spin, while mitigating phonon-induced dephasing at liquid helium temperature. Moreover, we indirectly control and characterize a 13C nuclear spin and establish a quantum register. We overcome limited nuclear spin initialization by implementing single-shot nuclear spin readout. Lastly, we demonstrate coherent optical control with GHz rates, thus connecting the register to the optical domain. Our work paves the way for future integration of quantum network registers into conventional, well-established photonics and hybrid quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Dunkl-Schrodinger Equation in Higher Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical solutions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions, incorporating the Dunkl operator. Two fundamental quantum mechanical problems are examined in their exact forms: the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. In order to obtain analytical solutions to these problems, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems were employed. Firstly, the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation is derived in d-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, and then for the isotropic harmonic potential interaction, its solutions are given. Subsequently, using polar coordinates the angular and radial parts of the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation are obtained. It is demonstrated that the system permits the separation of variables in both coordinate systems, with the resulting separated solutions expressed through Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Then, the radial Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation is solved using the isotropic harmonic, pseudoharmonic, and Coulomb potentials. The eigenstates and eigenvalues are obtained for each case and the behavior of the energy eigenvalue functions are illustrated graphically with the reduced probability densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we replace the standard partial derivatives in the Klein-Gordon equation with Dunkl derivatives and obtain exact analytical solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation in higher dimensions. We apply this formalism to two key quantum mechanical systems: the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. First, we introduce Dunkl quantum mechanics in d-dimensional polar coordinates, followed by an analysis of the d-dimensional Dunkl-Klein-Gordon oscillator. Subsequently, we derive the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions, which are expressed using confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the Dunkl formalism on both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the second case, we explore both the bound-state solutions and scattering scenarios of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation with the Coulomb potential. The bound-state solutions are represented in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, while the scattering states enable us to compute the particle creation density and probability using the Bogoliubov transformation method.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Distributed Quantum Computing Interconnect Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computing capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource allocation. This involves efficiently distributing quantum circuits across the network by assigning each circuit to an optimal subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary topologies and non-identical QPUs, resource allocation becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in such networks, focusing on computing resource management in a quantum farm setting. We propose a multi-objective optimisation algorithm for optimal QPU allocation that aims to minimise the degradation caused by inter-QPU communication latencies due to qubit decoherence, while maximising the number of concurrently assignable quantum circuits. The algorithm takes into account several key factors, including the network topology, QPU characteristics, and quantum circuit structure, to make efficient allocation decisions. We formulate the optimisation problem as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it using standard optimisation tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in minimising communication costs and improving resource utilisation compared to a benchmark greedy allocation approach. To complement our proposed QPU allocation method, we also present a compatible quantum circuit scheduling model. Our work provides valuable insights into resource allocation strategies for DQC systems and contributes to the development of efficient execution management frameworks for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Coherence influx is indispensable for quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo state property (ESP) is a fundamental property that allows an input-driven dynamical system to perform information processing tasks. Recently, extensions of ESP to potentially nonstationary systems and subsystems, that is, nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace ESP, have been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically analyze the sufficient and necessary conditions for a quantum system to satisfy nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace nonstationary ESP. Based on extensive usage of the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) form, we find that (1) the interaction with a quantum-coherent environment, termed \textit{coherence influx}, is indispensable in realizing nonstationary ESP, and (2) the spectral radius of PTM can characterize the fading memory property of quantum reservoir computing (QRC). Our numerical experiment, involving a system with a Hamiltonian that entails a spin-glass/many-body localization phase, reveals that the spectral radius of PTM can describe the dynamical phase transition intrinsic to such a system. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms under ESP of QRC, we propose a simplified model, multiplicative reservoir computing (mRC), which is a reservoir computing (RC) system with a one-dimensional multiplicative input. Theoretically and numerically, we show that the parameters corresponding to the spectral radius and coherence influx in mRC directly correlates with its linear memory capacity (MC). Our findings about QRC and mRC will provide a theoretical aspect of PTM and the input multiplicativity of QRC. The results will lead to a better understanding of QRC and information processing in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Qubit coupled with an effective negative-absolute-temperature bath in off-resonant collision model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum collision model provides a promising tool for investigating system-bath dynamics. Most of the studies on quantum collision models work in the resonant regime. In quantum dynamics, the off-resonant interaction often brings in exciting ffects. It is thereby attractive to investigate quantum collision models in the off-resonant regime. On the other hand, a bath with a negative absolute temperature is anticipated to be instrumental in developing thermal devices. The design of an effective bath with negative absolute temperature coupled to a qubit is significant for developing such thermal devices. We establish an effective negative-absolute-temperature bath coupled to a qubit with a quantum collision model in a far-off-resonant regime. We conduct a detailed and systematic investigation on the off-resonant collision model. There is an additional constraint on the collision duration resulting from the far-off resonant collision. The dynamics of the collision model in the far-off-resonant regime are different from the one beyond the far-off-resonant regime. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of coherence dynamics in open quantum systems, specifically addressing various physical realizations of quantum systems and environments, is a long-standing and central pillar of quantum science and technology. As such, a large body of work establishes a firm theoretical understanding of these processes. Nevertheless, a fundamental aspect of decoherence dynamics, namely the central limit theorem of qubit dephasing in the central spin model, which leads to a Gaussian approximation, lacks formal proof in realistically relevant scenarios. Here we prove this approximation for a bath depicted by an Ising spin system, in the presence of disorder and several (most relevant) functional forms of qubit-bath coupling. Importantly, we show that in certain cases, namely for short-range (exponentially decaying) coupling, this approximation breaks. These results provide a theoretical framework for studying decoherence dynamics in various systems and lead to insights into dephasing behavior with implications for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a weak measurement and measurement reversal-based scheme to ameliorate the effects of decoherence due to amplitude damping, on an NMR quantum processor. The weak measurement and measurement reversal processes require the implementation of non-unitary operations, which are typically infeasible on conventional quantum processors, where only unitary quantum operations are allowed. The duality quantum algorithm is used to efficiently implement the required non-unitary quantum operations corresponding to weak measurement and measurement reversal. We experimentally validate the efficacy of the weak measurement-based decoherence mitigation scheme by showing state protection on a four-qubit system, with one qubit being designated as the 'system qubit', while the remaining three qubits serve as 'ancilla qubits'. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the success of the weak measurement-based decoherence mitigation scheme in protecting the desired state. Since the measurement process involved has trace less than unity, the scheme can be thought of as a filtration scheme, where a subset of the spins is protected while the rest of the spins can be discarded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informational contributions to thermodynamics can be studied in isolation by considering systems with fully-degenerate Hamiltonians. In this regime, being in non-equilibrium -- termed informational non-equilibrium -- provides thermodynamic resources, such as extractable work, solely from the information content. The usefulness of informational non-equilibrium creates an incentive to obtain more of it, motivating the question of how to concentrate it: can we increase the local informational non-equilibrium of a product state $\rho\otimes\rho$ under a global closed system (unitary) evolution? We fully solve this problem analytically, showing that it is impossible for two-qubits, and it is always possible to find states achieving this in higher dimensions. The notion of bound resources in this framework is then discussed, along with initial global correlations' ability to activate concentration. Finally, we apply our results to study the concentration of purity and intrinsic randomness.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning based high-bandwidth magnetic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. We experimentally demonstrate this new approach, reaching an improvement in the relevant figure of merit by a factor of up to 5. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical mechanics and dynamics of particles that retains some memory of quantum statistics. Our work builds on earlier work on the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of such particles. Starting from the effective classical manifold associated with two-particle bosonic and fermionic coherent states, we show how their exchange statistics is reflected in the symplectic form of the manifold. We demonstrate the classical analogues of exclusion or bunching behavior expected in such states by studying their trajectories in various quadratic potentials. Our examples are two-particle coherent states in one dimension and two-particle vortex motion in the lowest Landau level. We finally compare and contrast our results with previous simulations of the full quantum system, and with existing results on the geometric interpretations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensing of photon addition and subtraction on nonclassical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance $W_{1}$ corresponding to optical tomograms of nonclassical states faithfully captures changes that arise due to photon addition to, or subtraction from, these states. $W_{1}$ is a true measure of distance in the quantum state space, and is sensitive to the underlying interference structures that arise in the tomogram after changes in the photon number. Our procedure is universally applicable to the cat and squeezed states, the former displaying the characteristic negativity in its Wigner function, while the latter does not do so. We explicate this in the case of the squeezed vacuum and even coherent states and show that photon addition (or subtraction) is mirrored in the shift in the intensity of specific regions in the tomogram. Further, we examine the dependence of $W_{1}$ on the squeezing parameter, and its sensitivity to different quadratures.</description>

      <title>SPARQ: Efficient Entanglement Distribution and Routing in Space-Air-Ground Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a space-air-ground quantum (SPARQ) network is developed as a means for providing a seamless on-demand entanglement distribution. The node mobility in SPARQ poses significant challenges to entanglement routing. Existing quantum routing algorithms focus on stationary ground nodes and utilize link distance as an optimality metric, which is unrealistic for dynamic systems like SPARQ. Moreover, in contrast to the prior art that assumes homogeneous nodes, SPARQ encompasses heterogeneous nodes with different functionalities further complicates the entanglement distribution. To solve the entanglement routing problem, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework is proposed and trained using deep Q-network (DQN) on multiple graphs of SPARQ to account for the network dynamics. Subsequently, an entanglement distribution policy, third-party entanglement distribution (TPED), is proposed to establish entanglement between communication parties. A realistic quantum network simulator is designed for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that the TPED policy improves entanglement fidelity by 3% and reduces memory consumption by 50% compared with benchmark. The results also show that the proposed DQN algorithm improves the number of resolved teleportation requests by 39% compared with shortest path baseline and the entanglement fidelity by 2% compared with an RL algorithm that is based on long short-term memory (LSTM). It also improved entanglement fidelity by 6% and 9% compared with two state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, the entanglement fidelity is improved by 15% compared with DQN trained on a snapshot of SPARQ. Additionally, SPARQ enhances the average entanglement fidelity by 23.5% compared with existing networks spanning only space and ground layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deterministic protocol for the preparation of arbitrary entangled states in the symmetric Dicke subspace of $N$ spins coupled to a common cavity mode. By combining a new geometric phase gate, an analytic solution of the noisy quantum channel dynamics and optimal control methods, the protocol prepares entangled states that are useful for quantum sensing, achieving a precision significantly better than the standard quantum limit in the presence of photon cavity loss, spontaneous emission and dephasing. This work opens the way to entanglement-enhanced sensing with cold trapped atoms in cavities and is also directly relevant for experiments with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spin-phonon architecture for scalable solid-state quantum nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state spin systems hold great promise for quantum information processing and the construction of quantum networks. However, the considerable inhomogeneity of spins in solids poses a significant challenge to the scaling of solid-state quantum systems. A practical protocol to individually control and entangle spins remains elusive. To this end, we propose a hybrid spin-phonon architecture based on spin-embedded SiC optomechanical crystal (OMC) cavities, which integrates photonic and phononic channels allowing for interactions between multiple spins. With a Raman-facilitated process, the OMC cavities support coupling between the spin and the zero-point motion of the OMC cavity mode reaching 0.57 MHz, facilitating phonon preparation and spin Rabi swap processes. Based on this, we develop a spin-phonon interface that achieves a two-qubit controlled-Z gate with a simulated fidelity of $96.80\%$ and efficiently generates highly entangled Dicke states with over $99\%$ fidelity, by engineering the strongly coupled spin-phonon dark state which is robust against loss from excited state relaxation as well as spectral inhomogeneity of the defect centers. This provides a hybrid platform for exploring spin entanglement with potential scalability and full connectivity in addition to an optical link, and offers a pathway to investigate quantum acoustics in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Quantum Contextual Topos: Integrating Modality and Topos Theory in Quantum Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Quantum Contextual Topos (QCT), a novel framework that extends traditional quantum logic by embedding contextual elements within a topos-theoretic structure. This framework seeks to provide a classically-obedient tool for exploring the logical foundations of quantum mechanics. The QCT framework aims to address the limitations of classical quantum logic, particularly its challenges in capturing the dynamic and contextual nature of quantum phenomena. By integrating modal operators and classical propositional logic within a topos structure, the QCT offers a unified approach to modeling quantum systems. The main result of this work is demonstrating that the internal logic of QCT corresponds to a form of classical propositional polymodal logic. We do this by generalizing Stone's Representation Theorem for a specific case of polymodal algebras and their underlying Stone Spaces.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Information Duality: Quantum Entanglement Contributions to Gravitational Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental duality between the geometric properties of spacetime and the informational content of quantum fields. Specifically, we establish that the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the entanglement entropy of quantum states, with geometric invariants mapping to informational measures. This framework modifies Einstein's field equations by introducing an informational stress-energy tensor derived from quantum entanglement entropy. Our findings have implications for black hole thermodynamics, cosmology, and quantum gravity, suggesting that quantum information fundamentally shapes the structure of spacetime. We incorporate this informational stress-energy tensor into Einstein's field equations, leading to modified spacetime geometry, particularly in regimes of strong gravitational fields, such as near black holes. We compute corrections to Newton's constant $G$ due to entanglement entropy contributions from various quantum fields and explore the consequences for black hole thermodynamics and cosmology. Our results indicate that quantum information plays a crucial role in gravitational dynamics, providing new insights into the nature of spacetime and potential solutions to long-standing challenges in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and pairing in two-nucleon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the entanglement and correlation in two-nucleon systems using isospin formalism. With the help of Slater decomposition, we derive analytical expressions for various entanglement measures. Specifically, we analyze the one- and two-mode entropies, mutual informations, and a basis-independent characteristic known as the one-body entanglement entropy. To understand the impact of pairing, we consider interactions involving isovector and isoscalar L=0 pairing terms. Our findings reveal that in certain cases, these pairing interactions lead to ground states that maximize the one-body entanglement entropy, provided that the total angular momentum and total isospin have zero projections. We provide numerical examples for the sd shell and explore the mutual informations in LS-coupled and jj-coupled single-particle bases. We find that the shell structure and angular momentum coupling significantly impact the measures of entanglement. Additionally, we establish the general implications of conserving angular momentum and isospin on the one-mode entropies, regardless of the particle number.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Industrial 300$\,$mm wafer processed spin qubits in natural silicon/silicon-germanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of the intrinsic dimension of data sets with quantum cognition machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new data representation method based on Quantum Cognition Machine Learning and apply it to manifold learning, specifically to the estimation of intrinsic dimension of data sets. The idea is to learn a representation of each data point as a quantum state, encoding both local properties of the point as well as its relation with the entire data. Inspired by ideas from quantum geometry, we then construct from the quantum states a point cloud equipped with a quantum metric. The metric exhibits a spectral gap whose location corresponds to the intrinsic dimension of the data. The proposed estimator is based on the detection of this spectral gap. When tested on synthetic manifold benchmarks, our estimates are shown to be robust with respect to the introduction of point-wise Gaussian noise. This is in contrast to current state-of-the-art estimators, which tend to attribute artificial ``shadow dimensions'' to noise artifacts, leading to overestimates. This is a significant advantage when dealing with real data sets, which are inevitably affected by unknown levels of noise. We show the applicability and robustness of our method on real data, by testing it on the ISOMAP face database, MNIST, and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.</description>

Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for R\'enyi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules.This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Universal semiclassical dynamics in disordered two-dimensional systems</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of disordered two-dimensional systems is much less understood than the dynamics of disordered chains, mainly due to the lack of appropriate numerical methods. We demonstrate that a single-trajectory version of the fermionic truncated Wigner approximation (fTWA) gives unexpectedly accurate results for the dynamics of one-dimensional (1D) systems with moderate or strong disorder. Additionally, the computational complexity of calculations carried out within this approximation is small enough to enable studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems larger than standard fTWA. Using this method, we analyze the dynamics of interacting spinless fermions propagating on disordered 1D and 2D lattices. We find for both spatial dimensions that the imbalance exhibits a universal dependence on the rescaled time $t/\xi_W$, where in 2D the time-scale $\xi_W$ follows a stretched-exponential dependence on disorder strength.</description>

Abstract: We construct a quantum oracle relative to which $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QMA}$ but cryptographic pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom unitary transformations exist, a counterintuitive result in light of the fact that pseudorandom states can be "broken" by quantum Merlin-Arthur adversaries. We explain how this nuance arises as the result of a distinction between algorithms that operate on quantum and classical inputs. On the other hand, we show that some computational complexity assumption is needed to construct pseudorandom states, by proving that pseudorandom states do not exist if $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{PP}$. We discuss implications of these results for cryptography, complexity theory, and shadow tomography.</description>

      <title>Contrary Inferences for Classical Histories within the Consistent Histories Formulation of Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories, that are called consistent, obey classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the semi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems. Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent sets and one can view each consistent set as a separate context. Using propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as the contrary inferences first noted by Kent [Physical Review Letters, 78(15):2874, 1997]. Proponents of the consistent histories formulation argue that one should not mix propositions coming from different consistent sets in making logical arguments, and that paradoxes such as the aforementioned contrary inferences are nothing else than the usual microscopic paradoxes of quantum contextuality as first demonstrated by Kochen and Specker theorem.
  In this contribution we use the consistent histories to describe a macroscopic (semi-classical) system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality (mixing different consistent sets) persist even in the semi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in the semi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival time of a semi-classical wave packet in an infinite square well. Surprisingly, we get consistent sets that disagree on whether the motion of the semi-classical system, that started within a subregion, ever left that subregion or not. Our results point to the need for constraints, additional to the consistency condition, to recover the correct semi-classical limit in this formalism and lead to the motto `all consistent sets are equal', but `some consistent sets are more equal than others'.</description>

      <title>Seeking a quantum advantage with trapped-ion quantum simulations of condensed-phase chemical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03156v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the quantum dynamics of molecules in the condensed phase represents a longstanding challenge in chemistry. Trapped-ion quantum systems may serve as a platform for the analog-quantum simulation of chemical dynamics that is beyond the reach of current classical-digital simulation. To identify a 'quantum advantage' for these simulations, performance analysis of both analog-quantum simulation on noisy hardware and classical-digital algorithms is needed. In this Review, we make a comparison between a noisy analog trapped-ion simulator and a few choice classical-digital methods on simulating the dynamics of a model molecular Hamiltonian with linear vibronic coupling. We describe several simple Hamiltonians that are commonly used to model molecular systems, which can be simulated with existing or emerging trapped-ion hardware. These Hamiltonians may serve as stepping stones toward the use of trapped-ion simulators for systems beyond the reach of classical-digital methods. Finally, we identify dynamical regimes where classical-digital simulations seem to have the weakest performance compared to analog-quantum simulations. These regimes may provide the lowest hanging fruit to exploit potential quantum advantages.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner's friend experiment is a thought experiment in which a so-called superobserver (Wigner) observes another observer (the friend) who has performed a quantum measurement on a physical system. In this setup Wigner treats the friend, the system and potentially other degrees of freedom involved in the friend's measurement as one joint quantum system. In general, Wigner's measurement changes the internal record of the friend's measurement result such that after the measurement by the superobserver the result stored in the observer's memory register is no longer the same as the result the friend obtained initially, i.e. before she was measured by Wigner. Here, we show that any awareness by the friend of this change of her memory, which can be modeled by an additional register storing the information about the change, conflicts with the no-signaling condition in extended Wigner-friend scenarios.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantum algorithm for preparation of uniform quantum superposition states</title>

Abstract: Quantum state preparation involving a uniform superposition over a non-empty subset of $n$-qubit computational basis states is an important and challenging step in many quantum computation algorithms and applications. In this work, we address the problem of preparation of a uniform superposition state of the form $\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{j = 0}^{M - 1} \ket{j}$, where $M$ denotes the number of distinct states in the superposition state and $2 \leq M \leq 2^n$. We show that the superposition state $\ket{\Psi}$ can be efficiently prepared with a gate complexity and circuit depth of only $O(\log_2~M)$ for all $M$. This demonstrates an exponential reduction in gate complexity in comparison to other existing approaches in the literature for the general case of this problem. Another advantage of the proposed approach is that it requires only $n=\ceil{\log_2~M}$ qubits. Furthermore, neither ancilla qubits nor any quantum gates with multiple controls are needed in our approach for creating the uniform superposition state $\ket{\Psi}$. It is also shown that a broad class of nonuniform superposition states that involve a mixture of uniform superposition states can also be efficiently created with the same circuit configuration that is used for creating the uniform superposition state $\ket{\Psi}$ described earlier, but with modified parameters.</description>

      <title>Correlating Local Quantum Reality with Causally Disconnected Choices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the 1935 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) assertion: ``{\it If, without in any way disrupting a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with a probability of one) the value of a physical quantity, then an element of physical reality corresponds to this physical quantity.}''; and employing a novel operational framework for measuring realism within quantum systems, we show that the elements of reality in one laboratory can be correlated with causally disconnected choices. EPR further stated that ``{\it ...$\,$physical reality cannot be determined by \emph{a priori} philosophical considerations, but must be found by$\,$...$\,$experiments and measurements.}'' In this direction, we provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical predictions. This is achieved by using an optical configuration as a guide, referred to as the Reality Quantum Correlator (RQC), and leveraging IBM's quantum computers to obtain the experimental results. So, complementing the assertions of EPR, we show that a detailed and clear definition is essential to fully understand observables' reality in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Information causality as a tool for bounding the set of quantum correlations</title>

Abstract: Information causality was initially proposed as a physical principle aimed at deriving the predictions of quantum mechanics on the type of correlations observed in the Bell experiment. In the same work, information causality was famously shown to imply the Uffink inequality that approximates the set of quantum correlations and rederives Tsirelson's bound of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. This result found limited generalizations due to the difficulty of deducing implications of the information causality principle on the set of nonlocal correlations. In this paper, we present a simple technique for obtaining polynomial inequalities from information causality bounding the set of physical correlations in any bipartite Bell scenario. This result makes information causality an efficient tool for approximating the set of quantum correlations. To demonstrate our method, we derive a family of inequalities which non-trivially constrains the set of nonlocal correlations in Bell scenarios with binary outcomes and equal number of measurement settings. Finally, we propose an improved statement of the information causality principle and obtain a tighter constraint for the simplest Bell scenario, that goes beyond the Uffink inequality and recovers a part of the boundary of the quantum set.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Pauli errors on cluster states by weighted distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of evaluating the difference between quantum states before and after being affected by errors encoded in unitary transformations. Standard distance functions, e.g., the Bures length, are not fully adequate for such a task. Weighted distances are instead appropriate information measures to quantify distinguishability of multipartite states. Here, we employ the previously introduced weighted Bures length and the newly defined weighted Hilbert-Schmidt distance to quantify how much single-qubit Pauli errors alter cluster states. We find that different errors of the same dimension change cluster states in a different way, i.e., their detectability is in general different. Indeed, they transform an ideal cluster state into a state whose weighted distance from the input depends on the specific chosen Pauli rotation, as well as the position of the affected qubit in the graph related to the state. As these features are undetected by using standard distances, the study proves the usefulness of weighted distances to monitor key but elusive properties of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce binary randomized benchmarking (BiRB), a protocol that streamlines traditional RB by using circuits consisting almost entirely of i.i.d. layers of gates. BiRB reliably and efficiently extracts the average error rate of a Clifford gate set by sending tensor product eigenstates of random Pauli operators through random circuits with i.i.d. layers. Unlike existing RB methods, BiRB does not use motion reversal circuits -- i.e., circuits that implement the identity (or a Pauli) operator -- which simplifies both the method and the theory proving its reliability. Furthermore, this simplicity enables scaling BiRB to many more qubits than the most widely-used RB methods.</description>

Abstract: All quantum systems are subject to noise from the environment or external controls. This noise is a major obstacle to the realization of quantum technology. For example, noise limits the fidelity of quantum gates. Employing optimal control theory, we study the generation of quantum single and two-qubit gates. Specifically, we explore a Markovian model of phase and amplitude noise, leading to the degradation of the gate fidelity. We show that optimal control with such noise models generates control solutions to mitigate the loss of gate fidelity. The problem is formulated in Liouville space employing an extremely accurate numerical solver and the Krotov algorithm for solving the optimal control equations.</description>

      <title>Tight and Efficient Gradient Bounds for Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training of a parameterized model largely depends on the landscape of the underlying loss function. In particular, vanishing gradients are a central bottleneck in the scalability of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and are known to arise in various ways. However, a caveat of most existing gradient bound results is the requirement of t-design circuit assumptions that are typically not satisfied in practice. In this work, we loosen these assumptions altogether and derive tight upper and lower bounds on loss and gradient concentration for a large class of parameterized quantum circuits and arbitrary observables, which are significantly stronger than prior work. Moreover, we show that these bounds, as well as the variance of the loss itself, can be estimated efficiently and classically-providing practical tools to study the loss landscapes of VQA models, including verifying whether or not a circuit/observable induces barren plateaus. In particular, our results can readily be leveraged to rule out barren plateaus for a realistic class of ans\"atze and mixed observables, namely, observables containing a non-vanishing local term. This insight has direct implications for hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs). We prove that designing the discriminator appropriately leads to 1-local weights that stay constant in the number of qubits, regardless of discriminator depth. This implies that qGANs with appropriately chosen generators do not suffer from barren plateaus even at scale-making them a promising candidate for applications in generative quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this result by training a qGAN to learn a 2D mixture of Gaussian distributions with up to 16 qubits, and provide numerical evidence that global contributions to the gradient, while initially exponentially small, may kick in substantially over the course of training.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) capability, two properties of fundamental importance to the physics and practical use of quantum many-body systems, covering systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems in finite spatial dimensions. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding $k$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial "phases" of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant "scaling threshold" of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <title>Magnomechanically controlled Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift in cavity QED</title>

Abstract: Phenomena involving interactions among magnons, phonons, and photons in cavity magnomechanical systems have attracted considerable attention recently, owing to their potential applications in the microwave frequency range. One such important effect is the response of a probe field to such tripartite interaction between photon-magnon-phonon. In this paper, we study Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a cavity magnomechanical system. We consider a YIG sphere positioned within a microwave cavity. A microwave control field directly drives the magnon mode in YIG sphere, whereas the cavity is driven via a weak probe field. Our results show that the GHS can be coherently controlled through magnon-phonon coupling via the control field. For instance, GHS can be tuned from positive to negative by tuning the magnon-phonon coupling. Similarly, the effective cavity detuning is another important controlling parameter for GHS. Furthermore, we observe that the enhancement of GHS occurs when magnon-phonon coupling is weak at resonance, and when the magnon-photon coupling is approximately equal to the loss of microwave photons. Our findings may have potential significance in applications related to microwave switching and sensing.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Notably, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include collective dissipative effects that arise from interactions with external common environments. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with nontrivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how non-adiabatic terms affect quantum dynamics is fundamental to improving various protocols for quantum technologies. We present a novel approach to computing the Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP), which gives information on the non-adiabatic terms that arise from time dependence in the Hamiltonian. Our approach uses commutators of the Hamiltonian to build up an appropriate basis of the AGP, which can be easily truncated to give an approximate form when the exact result is intractable. We use this approach to study the AGP obtained for the transverse field Ising model on a variety of graphs, showing how the different underlying graph structures can give rise to very different scaling for the number of terms required in the AGP.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Noise on the Training Performance of Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensively analyze the influence of different quantum noise gates, including Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel, on the performance of HyQNNs. Our results reveal distinct and significant effects on HyQNNs training and validation accuracies across different probabilities of noise. For instance, the Phase Flip gate introduces phase errors, and we observe that HyQNNs exhibit resilience at higher probability (p = 1.0), adapting effectively to consistent noise patterns, whereas at intermediate probabilities, the performance declines. Bit Flip errors, represented by the PauliX gate, impact HyQNNs in a similar way to that Phase Flip error gate. The HyQNNs, can adapt such kind of errors at maximum probability (p = 1.0). Unlike Phase and Bit Flip error gates, Phase Damping and Amplitude Damping gates disrupt quantum information, with HyQNNs demonstrating resilience at lower probabilities but facing challenges at higher probabilities. Amplitude Damping error gate, in particular, poses efficiency and accuracy issues at higher probabilities however with lowest probability (p = 0.1),it has the least effect and the HyQNNs, however not very effectively, but still tends to learn. The Depolarizing Channel proves most detrimental to HyQNNs performance, with limited or no training improvements. There was no training potential observed regardless of the probability of this noise gate. These findings underscore the critical need for advanced quantum error mitigation and resilience strategies in the design and training of HyQNNs, especially in environments prone to depolarizing noise. This paper quantitatively investigate that understanding the impact of quantum noise gates is essential for harnessing the full potential of quantum computing in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Useful variants and perturbations of completely entangled subspaces and spans of unextendible product bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4 (2004)]. More recently, Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)]; Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [Lett. Math. Phys, 114, 86 (2024)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally, we give examples of perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing. Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86% accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.</description>

      <title>Utilizing small quantum computers for machine learning and ground state energy approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14406v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit partitioning (QCP) is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. A quantum computation is divided into smaller subsystems and results of measurements on these subsystems are combined using classical processing. In this paper, we propose a QCP strategy to measure an observable on a large quantum system by utilizing several quantum systems of smaller size. The method can be applied to both machine learning and variational ground state energy approximation, and we show that the required calculations and the variance of the gradients can be tailored to scale efficiently with the total number of qubits. Thus it can be utilized to mitigate the well-known problem of barren plateaus. Additionally, the method can be realized by performing simple measurements of Pauli-strings on the separate subsystems, and the gradients can be estimated with common methods such as the parameter-shift rule. We demonstrate the method by approximating the ground state energy of the 1D transverse-field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions, and by classifying handwritten digits. For the ground state energy approximation, we achieved a relative error within the order of 0.1\% for all the tested system sizes. When applied to the classification between the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with 100\% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins (HAMSs) and harmonic oscillators provide multi-level manifolds (e.g., qudits) which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on-demand to implement a continuous range of generators associated to resonant driving of a harmonic qudit, which we can interpret as accomplishing linear and nonlinear control over a harmonic HAMS degree of freedom. The spin-like dynamics are verified by demonstration of linear spin coherent (SU(2)) rotations, nonlinear spin control, and comparison to other manifolds like simply-truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows the first universal control of such a harmonic qudit encoding: we use linear operations to accomplish four logical gates, and further show that nonlinear harmonicity-preserving operations complete the logical gate set. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on quantum dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) by explaining their origin in terms of caustics that form in the Fock space representation of the many-body state over time, using the fully connected transverse field Ising model as an example. In this way we establish a connection between DPTs in a quantum spin system and an everyday natural phenomenon: The dark band between the primary and seconday bows (caustics) in rainbows known as Alexander's dark band. The DPT occurs when the Loschmidt echo crosses the switching line between the evanescent tails of two back-to-back Airy functions that dress neighbouring fold caustics in Fock space and is the time-dependent analogue of what is seen as a function of angle in the sky. The structural stability and universal properties of caustics, as described mathematically by catastrophe theory, explains the generic occurrence of DPTs in the model and suggests that our analysis has wide applicability. Based on our thorough analytical understanding we propose a protocol which can be used to verify the existence of a DPT in a finite system experiment.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Search Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Excited State Computations</title>

Abstract: Quantum systems in excited states are attracting significant interest with the advent of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While ground states of small molecular systems are typically explored using hybrid variational algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the study of excited states has received much less attention, partly due to the absence of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce the subspace search quantum imaginary time evolution (SSQITE) method, which calculates excited states using quantum devices by integrating key elements of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) and the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) method. The effectiveness of SSQITE is demonstrated through calculations of low-lying excited states of benchmark model systems, including $\text{H}_2$ and $\text{LiH}$ molecules. A toy Hamiltonian is also employed to demonstrate that the robustness of VarQITE in avoiding local minima extends to its use in excited state algorithms. With this robustness in avoiding local minima, SSQITE shows promise for advancing quantum computations of excited states across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking states in stochastic dephasing stabilizer circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies.In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subgroup SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>A Feasible Design of Elementary Quantum Arithmetic Logic Units for Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic logic units (QALUs) constitute a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, the implementation of QALUs on near-term quantum computers remains a substantial challenge, largely due to the limited connectivity of qubits. In this paper, we propose feasible QALUs, including quantum binary adders, subtractors, multipliers, and dividers, which are designed for near-term quantum computers with qubits arranged in two-dimensional arrays. Additionally, we introduce a feasible quantum arithmetic operation to compute the two's complement representation of signed integers. The proposed QALUs utilize only Pauli-X gates, CNOT gates, and $C\sqrt{X}$ (CSX) gates, and all two-qubit gates are operated between nearest neighbor qubits. Our work demonstrates a viable implementation of QALUs on near-term quantum computers, advancing towards scalable and resource-efficient quantum arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in fueling many quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. This is due to the need to precisely characterise many-copy, asymptotic protocols for entanglement processing. Here we overcome these issues by introducing a new way of benchmarking the fundamental protocol of entanglement distillation (purification), where instead of measuring its asymptotic yield, we focus on the best achievable error. We connect this formulation of the task with an information-theoretic problem in composite quantum hypothesis testing known as generalised Sanov's theorem. By solving the latter problem -- which had no previously known solution even in classical information theory -- we thus compute the optimal asymptotic error exponent of entanglement distillation. We show this asymptotic solution to be given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state, which is a unique feature among operational measures of entanglement. Altogether, we thus demonstrate a measure of entanglement that admits a direct operational interpretation as the optimal asymptotic rate of an important entanglement manipulation protocol while enjoying an exact, single-letter formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between synchronous games and their associated $*$-algebra. Building upon the work of (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017), we propose results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze (Watts, Helton and Klep, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 2023), we build computational tools that check the non-existence of perfect $C^*$ and algebraic strategies of synchronous games using Gr\"obner basis methods and semidefinite programming. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models questioned in (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017). We also extend the quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ due to (Ji, arXiv 2013) by exhibiting another instance of such reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those in chaotic systems. Specifically, for initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks and the negative values of tripartite mutual information. We also find that the spectral form factor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These findings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Selective Amplification of a Gravitational Wave Signal Using an Atomic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel principle for quantum sensing of gravitational waves by exploiting the collective emission rate of a one-dimensional array of initially uncorrelated atoms to selectively amplify a gravitational wave signal over flat spacetime contributions. In contrast to a single atom, we find that the collective emission rate of the array is sensitive to the gravitational wave at first order in its amplitude. We quantify the collective response of the array to an incident gravitational wave by introducing the notion of the effective number of atoms cooperating to sense the gravitational wave. We determine the optimal interatomic spacing such that the flat spacetime collective effects vanish, but the imprint of the gravitational wave in the emission rate of the array scales nearly quadratically with the number of atoms. The near-quadratic scaling counteracts the small amplitude of the gravitational wave. Furthermore, the coherent photon emission, which encodes the gravitational wave imprint, exhibits well-defined directionality and occurs at frequencies shifted by the wave's frequency. We analyze the setup's response to prototypical gravitational wave signals and show that, for coherent array sizes potentially realizable in the near-term, the two advancements - collective response at first order in the gravitational wave's amplitude, and near-quadratic scaling with the number of atoms - yield a photon emission rate large enough to be resolved by current technology in photon detectors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum money is the first invention in quantum information science, promising advantages over classical money by simultaneously achieving unforgeability, user privacy, and instant validation. However, standard quantum money relies on quantum memories and long-distance quantum communication, which are technologically extremely challenging. Quantum "S-money" tokens eliminate these technological requirements while preserving unforgeability, user privacy, and instant validation. Here, we report the first full experimental demonstration of quantum S-tokens, proven secure despite errors, losses and experimental imperfections. The heralded single-photon source with a high system efficiency of 88.24% protects against arbitrary multi-photon attacks arising from losses in the quantum token generation. Following short-range quantum communication, the token is stored, transacted, and verified using classical bits. We demonstrate a transaction time advantage over intra-city 2.77 km and inter-city 60.54 km optical fibre networks, compared with optimal classical cross-checking schemes. Our implementation demonstrates the practicality of quantum S-tokens for applications requiring high security, privacy and minimal transaction times, like financial trading and network control. It is also the first demonstration of a quantitative quantum time advantage in relativistic cryptography, showing the enhanced cryptographic power of simultaneously considering quantum and relativistic physics.</description>

Abstract: In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and that its perfect quantum-commuting (bi)strategies are quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of ion trap and the precise placement of its electrodes are necessary for the integration of a microcavity to facilitate efficient ion-cavity coupling. We present a miniature monolithic ion trap made of gold-coated fused silica with high numerical aperture access. A laser writing method referred to as selective laser etching is employed to extract a trap structure from a block of fused silica. The fully monolithic structure eliminates the need for any post-fabrication alignment. Trenches are integrated into this structure such that the various electrodes on the monolithic device remain electrically isolated following their metalization via evaporative coating. We give details of the trap design and production, along with the demonstration of successful trapping of ions and characerization of the trap.</description>

      <title>How to integrate a miniature optical cavity in a linear ion trap: shielding dielectrics and trap symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One method of scaling up quantum systems is to adopt a modular approach. In the ion trap architecture, an efficient photonic interface between independent linear ion traps would allow for such expansion. To this end, an optical cavity with a small mode volume can be utilised to enhance the photon emission probability from the ion. Miniature fibre-based Fabry-Perot cavities have been integrated into three-dimensional Paul traps that hold a single ion, whereas an efficient interface between an optical cavity and a linear trap that can keep multiple ions has remained elusive. This presents a barrier for combining the benefits of the motional coupling in a chain of ions with optical interface between ion traps. In this paper, we show that simple electrically conductive shielding of the fibres could provide substantial advantage in mitigating the adverse effects of stray charges and motional heating by dielectrics. We also reveal that the conductive shields are not compatible with the conventional radio frequency (rf) drive in ion traps but using two rf signals with opposite phases can solve this issue. Furthermore the role played by the symmetry of the electrodes when incorporating an element that disrupts the translational symmetry of a linear trap is elucidated analytically. As a result it is realized that two-dimensional implementation of a linear ion trap such as a surface trap is inherently not suitable for integrating a shielded miniature optical cavity due to the lack of geometrical symmetry. Based on the insights obtained through the analysis, we identify essential components and a design strategy that should be incorporated in a linear ion trap for successful integration of a miniature optical cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) is an entanglement-based protocol for improving lidar/radar detection of unresolved targets beyond what a classical lidar/radar of the same average transmitted energy can do. Originally proposed by Lloyd as a discrete-variable quantum lidar, it was soon shown that his proposal offered no quantum advantage over its best classical competitor. Continuous-variable, specifically Gaussian-state, QI has been shown to offer true quantum advantage, both in theory and in table-top experiments. Moreover, despite its considerable drawbacks, the microwave version of Gaussian-state QI continues to attract research attention. Recently, however, Pannu et al. (arXiv:2407.08005 [quant-ph]) have: (1) combined the entangled state from Lloyd's QI with the channel models from Gaussian-state QI; (2) proposed a new positive operator-valued measurement for that composite setup; and (3) claimed that, unlike Gaussian-state QI, their QI achieves the Nair-Gu lower bound on QI target-detection error probability at all noise brightnesses. Pannu et al.'s analysis was asymptotic, i.e., it presumed infinite-dimensional entanglement. This paper works out the finite-dimensional performance of Pannu et al.'s QI. It shows that there is a threshold value for the entangled-state dimensionality below which there is no quantum advantage, and above which the Nair-Gu bound is approached asymptotically. Moreover, with both systems operating with error-probability exponents 1 dB lower than the Nair-Gu bound's, Pannu et al.'s QI requires much higher entangled-state dimensionality than does Gaussian-state QI to achieve useful error probabilities in both high-brightness (100 photons/mode) and moderate-brightness (1 photon/mode) noise. Furthermore, neither system has appreciable quantum advantage in low-brightness (&lt;&lt;1 photon/mode) noise.</description>

      <title>CompressedMediQ: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as 4D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and IBM quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>

      <title>Instantons and transseries of the Mathieu potential deformed by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative effects of a deformation of the Mathieu differential equation consistent with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. First, we develop a connection between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian scenarios by a reparameterization in the complex plane, followed by a restriction of the $\mathcal{PT}$ deformation parameter. The latter is responsible for preserving the information about $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry when we choose to work in the Hermitian scenario. We note that this factor is present in all non-perturbative results and in the transseries representation of the deformed Mathieu partition function that we have obtained. In quantum mechanics, we found that the deformation parameter of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has an effect on the real instanton solution for the deformed Mathieu potential in the Hermitian scenario. As its value increases, the non-Hermiticity factor makes it smoother for the instanton to pass from one minimum to another, that is, it modifies the instanton width. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the height of the potential barrier decreases as we increase the value of the deformation parameter. We present how this effect extends to the multi-instanton level and to the bounce limit of an instanton-anti-instanton pair. As an application of the obtained results, we show that the equation of motion under a tilted version of the potential in the Hermitian scenario compares to the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model for the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Forecasting steam mass flow in power plants using the parallel hybrid network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the "very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drug design process currently requires considerable time and resources to develop each new compound that enters the market. This work develops an application of hybrid quantum generative models based on the integration of parametrized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks, and proposes quantum cycle architectures that improve model performance and stability during training. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, QM9 and PC9, the introduced models are shown to outperform the previously achieved scores. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the quantitative estimation of druglikeness. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Deterministic identification over channels with finite output: a dimensional perspective on superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension $d$ of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq \frac12 d$. Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a "Hypothesis Testing Lemma" showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for quantum optoelectromechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-\Qm{} mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-\Qm{} mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with \Qm{} up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained \SI{290}{\nano\meter}-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a \Qf-product approaching $10^{13}$\,\SI{}{\hertz} at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80\% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.</description>

      <title>Disjointness of inertial KMS states and the role of Lorentz symmetry in thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint, i.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary, have separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike cluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by the inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus showing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial frame is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We review the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems theory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior of detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue that the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant velocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot thermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the physical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged "heat bath" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and RTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest frame of the detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the properties of a one-dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in different Gauss law sectors, corresponding to different configurations of static charges set by the orientations of the gauge spins. Importantly, in quantum simulator experiments these sectors can be accessed without adding any additional physical particles or changing the Hamiltonian: The Gauss law sectors are simply set by the initial conditions. We study the interplay between conservation laws and interactions when the static charges are chosen to form periodic patterns. We classify the different Gauss law sectors and use the density matrix renormalization group to calculate the ground state compressibility, density profiles, charge density wave order parameters, and single particle correlation functions as a function of matter density. We find confined and deconfined phases, charge density waves, correlated insulators, and supersolids.</description>

      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: Influence on edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Capacity of entanglement and volume law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of capacity of entanglement in certain setups whose entanglement entropy becomes extensive and obeys a volume law. In particular, considering geometric decomposition of the Hilbert space, we study this measure both in the vacuum state of a family of non-local scalar theories and also in the squeezed states of a local scalar theory. We also evaluate field space capacity of entanglement between interacting scalar field theories. We present both analytical and numerical evidences for the volume law scaling of this quantity in different setups and discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including Renyi entropies. Our study reveals some generic properties of the capacity of entanglement and the corresponding reduced density matrix in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement, we discuss some implications of our results on the existence of consistent holographic duals for the models in question.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A muon collider represents a promising candidate for the next generation of particle physics experiments after the expected end of LHC operations in the early 2040s. Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the production of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider. We present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in H to ZZ to 4l events at a potential future muon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be reconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson decays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain the expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum entanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be maximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with high significance.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-lattice Bloch wave dynamics in a single-mode microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>
