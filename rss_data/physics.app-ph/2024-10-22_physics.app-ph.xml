      <title>Neuromorphic information processing using ultrafast heat dynamics and quench switching of an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving complex tasks in a modern information-driven society requires novel materials and concepts for energy-efficient hardware. Antiferromagnets offer a promising platform for seeking such approaches due to their exceptional features: low power consumption and possible high integration density are desirable for information storage and processing or applications in unconventional computing. Among antiferromagnets, CuMnAs stands out for atomic-level scalable magnetic textures, analogue multilevel storage capability, and the magnetic state's control by a single electrical or femtosecond laser pulse. Using a pair of excitation laser pulses, this work examines synaptic and neuronal functionalities of CuMnAs for information processing, readily incorporating two principles of distinct characteristic timescales. Laser-induced transient heat dynamics at sub-nanosecond times represents the short-term memory and causes resistance switching due to quenching into a magnetically fragmented state. This quench switching, detectable electrically from ultrashort times to hours after writing, reminisces the long-term memory. The versatility of the principles' combination is demonstrated by operations commonly used in neural networks. Temporal latency coding, fundamental to spiking neural networks, is utilized to encode data from a grayscale image into sub-nanosecond pulse delays. Applying input laser pulses with distinct amplitudes then allows for pulse-pattern recognition. The results open pathways for designing novel computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Resonance of Vector Vortex Beams in a Triangular Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate resonance of first-order vector vortex beams (VVB) with a triangular optical cavity. We also show that, due to their symmetry properties, the so-called radial and azimuthal VVBs do not resonate at the same cavity length, which could be explored to use the triangular resonator as a mode sorter. In addition, an intracavity Pancharatnam phase shifter (PPS) is implemented in order to compensate for any birefringent phase that the cavity mirrors may introduce.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of vortex and pseudovortex beams with a triangular optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A triangular optical cavity can be used to distinguish between two beams with the same intensity profile but different wavefronts. This is what we show in this paper, both theoretically and experimentally, in the case of beams with a doughnut-like intensity profile: one of them having a helical wavefront (vortex beam with orbital angular momentum) and the other with no orbital angular momentum at all (which we call pseudovortex beam). We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theory, showing that each beam displays its own resonance pattern. Therefore, such cavity may be used to identify beams with orbital angular momentum, distinguishing them from pseudovortices.</description>

      <title>Optical coherent perfect absorption and amplification in a time-varying medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-invariant photonic structures amplify or absorb light based on their intrinsic material gain or loss. The coherent interference of multiple beams in space, e.g., in a resonator, can be exploited to tailor the wave interaction with material gain or loss, respectively maximizing lasing or coherent perfect absorption. By contrast, a time-varying system is not bound to conserve energy, even in the absence of material gain or loss, and can support amplification or absorption of a probe wave through parametric phenomena. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how a subwavelength film of indium tin oxide, whose bulk permittivity is homogeneously and periodically modulated via optical pumping, can be dynamically tuned to act both as a non-resonant amplifier and a perfect absorber, by manipulating the relative phase of two counterpropagating probe beams. This extends the concept of coherent perfect absorption to the temporal domain. We interpret this result as selective switching between the gain and loss modes present in the momentum bandgap of a periodically modulated medium. By tailoring the relative intensity of the two probes, high-contrast modulation can be achieved with up to 80% absorption and 400% amplification. Our results demonstrate control of gain and loss in time-varying media at optical frequencies and pave the way towards coherent manipulation of light in Floquet-engineered complex photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Quantum Emitters in hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent quantum emitters are a central resource for advanced quantum technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts a range of quantum emitters that can be engineered using techniques such as high-temperature annealing, optical doping, and irradiation with electrons or ions. Here, we demonstrate that such processes can degrade the coherence, and hence the functionality, of quantum emitters in hBN. Specifically, we show that hBN annealing and doping methods that are used routinely in hBN nanofabrication protocols give rise to decoherence of B-center quantum emitters. The decoherence is characterized in detail, and attributed to defects that act as charge traps which fluctuate electrostatically during SPE excitation and induce spectral diffusion. The decoherence is minimal when the emitters are engineered by electron beam irradiation of as-grown, pristine flakes of hBN, where B-center linewidths approach the lifetime limit needed for quantum applications involving interference and entanglement. Our work highlights the critical importance of crystal lattice quality to achieving coherent quantum emitters in hBN, despite the common perception that the hBN lattice and hBN SPEs are highly-stable and resilient against chemical and thermal degradation. It underscores the need for nanofabrication techniques that are minimally invasive and avoid crystal damage when engineering hBN SPEs and devices for quantum-coherent technologies.</description>

      <title>High-Order Associative Learning Based on Memristive Circuits for Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive associative learning has gained significant attention for its ability to mimic fundamental biological learning mechanisms while maintaining system simplicity. In this work, we introduce a high-order memristive associative learning framework with a biologically realistic structure. By utilizing memristors as synaptic modules and their state information to bridge different orders of associative learning, our design effectively establishes associations between multiple stimuli and replicates the transient nature of high-order associative learning. In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments, our design achieves a 230% improvement in learning efficiency compared to previous works, with memristor power consumption in the synaptic modules remaining below 11 {\mu}W. In large-scale image recognition tasks, we utilize a 20*20 memristor array to represent images, enabling the system to recognize and label test images with semantic information at 100% accuracy. This scalability across different tasks highlights the framework's potential for a wide range of applications, offering enhanced learning efficiency for current memristor-based neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Automatic Extraction and Compensation of P-Bit Device Variations in Large Array Utilizing Boltzmann Machine Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Bit (P-Bit) device serves as the core hardware for implementing Ising computation. However, the severe intrinsic variations of stochastic P-Bit devices hinder the large-scale expansion of the P-Bit array, significantly limiting the practical usage of Ising computation. In this work, a behavioral model which attributes P-Bit variations to two parameters {\alpha} and {\Delta}V is proposed. Then the weight compensation method is introduced, which can mitigate {\alpha} and {\Delta}V of P-Bits device variations by rederiving the weight matrix, enabling them to compute as ideal identical PBits without the need for weights retraining. Accurately extracting the {\alpha} and {\Delta}V simultaneously from a large P-Bit array which is prerequisite for the weight compensation method is a crucial and challenging task. To solve this obstacle, we present the novel automatic variation extraction algorithm which can extract device variations of each P-Bit in a large array based on Boltzmann machine learning. In order for the accurate extraction of variations from an extendable P-Bit array, an Ising Hamiltonian based on 3D ferromagnetic model is constructed, achieving precise and scalable array variation extraction. The proposed Automatic Extraction and Compensation algorithm is utilized to solve both 16-city traveling salesman problem(TSP) and 21-bit integer factorization on a large P-Bit array with variation, demonstrating its accuracy, transferability, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Aluminum Scandium Nitride as a Functional Material at 1000{\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a highly promising material for high-temperature applications due to its robust piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties. This study investigates the behavior of Al0.7Sc0.3N thin films in extreme thermal environments, demonstrating functional stability up to 1000{\deg}C, making it suitable for use in aerospace, hypersonics, deep-well, and nuclear reactor systems. Tantalum silicide (TaSi2)/Al0.7Sc0.3N/TaSi2 capacitors were fabricated and characterized across a wide temperature range, revealing robust ferroelectric and dielectric properties, along with significant enhancement in piezoelectric performance. At 1000{\deg}C, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops showed a substantial reduction in coercive field from 4.3 MV/cm to 1.2 MV/cm, while the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient increased nearly tenfold, reaching 75.1 pm/V at 800{\deg}C. Structural analysis via scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the integrity of the TaSi2/Al0.7Sc0.3N interfaces, even after exposure to extreme temperatures. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling coefficient was calculated to increase by over 500%, from 12.9% at room temperature to 82% at 700{\deg}C. These findings establish AlScN as a versatile material for high-temperature ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric applications, offering unprecedented thermal stability and functional enhancement.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Spontaneous Orientation Polarization in Organic Semiconductor Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment of permanent dipole moments and the resulting spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) is commonly observed in evaporated neat films of polar organic molecules and leads to a so-called giant surface potential. In case of mixed films, often enhanced molecular orientation is observed, i.e.\ a higher degree of alignment, in comparison to neat layers, if it is diluted into a suitable (non-polar) host. So far, different possible influences on molecular orientation have been discussed, the most prominent probably being the so-called surface equilibration model. In this contribution, we discuss how surface equilibration can influence orientation in mixed layers, and which other intermolecular interactions have to be considered to explain the observed enhancement of SOP in mixed layers.</description>

      <title>Miniature magneto-oscillatory wireless sensor for magnetic field and gradient measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-oscillatory devices have been recently developed as very potent wireless miniature position trackers and sensors with an exceptional accuracy and sensing distance for surgical and robotic applications. However, it is still unclear to which extend a mechanically resonating sub-millimeter magnet interacts with external magnetic fields or gradients, which induce frequency shifts of sub-mHz to several Hz and therefore affect the sensing accuracy. Here, we investigate this effect experimentally on a cantilever-based magneto-oscillatory wireless sensor (MOWS) and build an analytical model concerning magnetic and mechanical interactions. The millimeter-scale MOWS is capable to detect magnetic fields with sub-uT resolution to at least +/- 5 mT, and simultaneously detects magnetic field gradients with a resolution of 65 uT/m to at least +/- 50 mT/m. The magnetic field sensitivity allows direct calculation of mechanical device properties, and by rotation, individual contributions of the magnetic field and gradient can be analyzed. The derived model is general and can be applied to other magneto-oscillatory systems interacting with magnetic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes enable the protection and correction of quantum information in a single continuous variable system. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Floquet Hamiltonian engineering. We construct the target Hamiltonian directly from the target state and engineer the codes states with an adiabatic ramp protocol. We introduce a new universal set of quantum lattice gate composed of only one type of gate element, and develop a systematic decomposition of complex code state preparation and transformation processes into sequences of quantum lattice gates. We apply our method to three basic code states engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and transformation. We also discuss the automatic quantum error correction against photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behavior of non-idealized Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. Using a beam element simulator, we systematically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient 4D-STEM in SEM: Beyond 2D Materials to Metallic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) is a powerful tool that allows for the simultaneous acquisition of spatial and diffraction information, driven by recent advancements in direct electron detector technology. Although 4D-STEM has been predominantly developed for and used in conventional TEM and STEM, efforts are being made to implement the technique in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this paper, we push the boundaries of 4D-STEM in SEM and extend its capabilities in three key aspects: (1) faster acquisition rate with reduced data size, (2) higher angular resolution, and (3) application to various materials including conventional alloys and focused ion beam (FIB) lamella. Specifically, operating the MiniPIX Timepix3 detector in the event-driven mode significantly improves the acquisition rate by a factor of a few tenths compared to conventional frame-based mode, thereby opening up possibilities for integrating 4D-STEM into various in situ SEM testing. Furthermore, with a novel stage-detector geometry, a camera length of 160 mm is achieved which improves the angular resolution amplifying its utility, for example, magnetic or electric field imaging. Lastly, we successfully imaged a nanostructured platinum-copper thin film with a grain size of 16 nm and a thickness of 20 nm, and identified annealing twins in FIB-prepared polycrystalline copper using virtual darkfield imaging and orientation mapping. This work demonstrates the potential of synergetic combination of 4D-STEM with in situ experiments, and broadening its applications across a wide range of materials.</description>

These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical simulations and theoretical consideration. Ultrastrong coupling is due to a direct interaction of magnons in the magnetic meta-atom with microwave photons confined in the chiral meta-atom as a resonator. Our results reveal a crucial step in identifying deepstrongly-coupled and optically-moving magnon-polaritons for hybrid quantum systems, synthetic gauge fields, and quasi-particle ``chemistry'' using metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Extending Radiowave Frequency Detection Range with Dressed States of Solid-State Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors using solid-state spin defects excel in the detection of radiofrequency (RF) fields, serving various purposes in communication, ranging, and sensing. For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are typically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these methods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge for sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We compare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the detection of RF signals up to $\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit imposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD method in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency detection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various domains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Forming and Compliance-free Operation of Low-energy, Fast-switching HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate low energy, forming and compliance-free operation of a resistive memory obtained by the partial oxidation of a two-dimensional layered van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). Semiconductor - oxide heterostructures are achieved by low temperature ($&lt;300^{o}$C) thermal oxidation of HfS$_2$ in dry conditions, carefully controlling process parameters. The resulting HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ heterostructures are integrated between metal contacts, forming vertical crossbar devices. Forming-free, compliance-free resistive switching between non-volatile states is demonstrated by applying voltage pulses and measuring the current response in time. We show non-volatile memory operation with an R$_{ON}$/ R$_{OFF}$ of 102, programmable by 80ns WRITE and ERASE operations. Multiple stable resistance states are achieved by modulating pulse width and amplitude, down to 60ns, $&lt;$ 20pJ operation. This demonstrates the capability of these devices for low - energy, fast-switching and multi-state programming. Resistance states were retained without fail at 150$^o$C over 10$^4$s, showcasing the potential of these devices for long retention times and resilience to ageing. Low-energy resistive switching measurements were repeated in vacuum (8.6 mbar) showing unchanged characteristics and no dependence of the device on surrounding oxygen or water vapour. Using a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tool, we explore the role of the semiconductor layer in tuning the device conductance and driving gradual resistive switching in 2D HfO$_x$ - based devices.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic swelling of stiff hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that stiff polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively swell (dilate) when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a volumetric diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. Upon shearing, we observed an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain, and persisted for hours. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all stiff hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.</description>

      <title>Low frequency noise in nanoparticle-molecule networks and implications for in-materio reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic waveguide chip-to-free-space beam scanning at 68 Million Spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seamless chip-to-world photonic interface enables wide-ranging advancements in optical ranging, display, communication, computation, imaging, and light-matter interaction. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning of a diffraction-limited beam from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of beam-spots in free-space. Currently, devices with direct PIC integration rely on tiled apertures with poor mode qualities, large footprints, and complex control systems. Micro-mechanical beam scanners have good beam quality but lack direct PIC integration and are inertially-limited due to the use of bulk optical components or structures in which the optical aperture and actuator sizes are inextricably linked, resulting in trade-offs among resolution, speed, and footprint. Here, we overcome these limitations with the photonic "ski-jump": a nanoscale optical waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezoelectrically actuated cantilever which passively curls ~90$^{\circ}$ out-of-plane in a footprint of &lt;0.1 mm$^{2}$, emits sub-micron diffraction-limited optical modes, and exhibits kHz-rate mechanical resonances with quality factors exceeding 10,000. This enables two-dimensional beam-scanning with footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 mega-spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$) at CMOS-level voltages, which is equivalent to a 1 megapixel display at 100 Hz from a 1.5 mm$^{2}$ footprint, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by &gt;50$\times$. Using this device, we demonstrate image projection, video projection, and the initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancy centers in diamond waveguides. Based on current performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 giga-spots at kHz-rates in a ~1 cm$^{2}$ area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>Response of a multi-wavelength laser to single-sideband optical injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-mode semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection have been shown to trigger a wide range of dynamical behavior from injection locking to chaos. Multi-wavelength lasers add even more degrees of freedom and complexity to the dynamical repertoire potentially unlocking new functionalities for applications ranging from THz generation and processing to all-optical memories. In particular, leveraging the inherent mode coupling in multi-wavelength lasers, spectral multiplication over a THz range of an injected optical signal has been shown. While most of the research on optical injection has been focused on single-mode semiconductor lasers, the dynamical behavior of multi-wavelength lasers, particularly when subjected to injection of amplitude-modulated signals remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the response of an on-chip dual-wavelength laser subject to the optical injection of a single-sideband signal around one of the modes of the laser. Our findings show an asymmetric power evolution of the sidebands appearing around both the injected and un-injected modes with respect to the modulation frequency. The power and bandwidth of the sideband signals strongly depend on the resonance frequency produced by the interference between the cavity mode and the injection, which can be tailored by twerking the strength and the detuning of the injection. The outcomes of our numerical investigations, based on rate equations, align closely with the experimental results highlighting the influence of key injection and laser parameters.</description>
