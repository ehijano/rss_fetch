      <title>Quantum Gravity on AdS$_3\times$S$^3$ from CFT: Bootstrapping $n=21$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the simplest four-point scattering amplitude of $SO(n)$ tensor multiplets in six-dimensional (2,0) supergravity on AdS$_3\times$S$^3$. Using crossing symmetry and the consistency of the operator product expansion in the dual CFT, we explicitly construct the one-loop contribution to the correlator at order $1/c^2$, both in position space and in Mellin space. We show that a strong form of the bootstrap equations imposes constraints on the value of $n$. Remarkably, we find that our bootstrap approach uniquely determines $n=21$, which corresponds to the spectrum of IIB string theory compactified on K3. This stands in sharp contrast to the tree-level correlator for which $n$ is unconstrained. We also analyse the spectrum of unprotected double-trace operators and solve the mixing problem in the first case that involves both tensor and graviton correlators. When $n=21$, the anomalous dimensions rationalise and one of them vanishes. Lastly, we study the flat-space limit of the correlator and find perfect agreement with the one-loop amplitude recently obtained in [arXiv:2510.24558].</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deconfined Criticality to 3D $N$-Flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Quantum Chromodynamics on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.</description>

      <title>Kosmann derivative and momentum maps from a duality covariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A covariant implementation of diffeomorphisms in the presence of local symmetries is a nontrivial aspect of gravitational theories. In Double Field Theory, this is achieved through the so-called generalized Kosmann derivative. In this work, we show that the generalized Kosmann derivative admits a natural formulation entirely in terms of generalized fluxes through the inclusion of a compensating term that plays the role of a generalized momentum map, yielding a fully determined and covariant operator that provides a covariant realization of generalized diffeomorphisms. When parameterized in terms of the field content of heterotic supergravity, the resulting symmetry transformations give rise to momentum maps at the supergravity level, offering a duality-covariant interpretation of these objects. This framework provides a natural setting for the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry with internal symmetries, with direct implications for black hole thermodynamics and its higher-derivative corrections in a duality-covariant setting.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter Sigma Model from Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel two-field four-dimensional integrable field theory (IFT) from 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. The four-dimensional IFT depends on a skew-symmetric linear operator acting on a Lie algebra, and when this operator is specialised to a solution of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the IFT develops a semi-local symmetry associated with this solution. The resulting 4d analogue of the Yang-Baxter sigma model is related by symmetry reduction to the well-known 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model. An important implication that we find is the embedding of the equations of motion of the 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model in the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The 6d Chern-Simons theory on twistor space can alternatively be symmetry reduced to a 4d Chern-Simons theory configuration with disorder surface defects. The latter realises the Yang-Baxter sigma model, implying a "diamond" for the Yang-Baxter sigma model obtained from twistor space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phase structure and topological charge of Hayward-AdS black holes under phase space constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the Hayward-AdS black hole and compare it with its singular counterpart from which it can be constructed through the imposition of an additional constraint. The singular black hole displays a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions reminiscent of those observed in higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS spacetimes. After the constraint is imposed, the resulting Hayward-AdS black hole continues to exhibit Van der Waals-type $P-V$ criticality. However, its Gibbs free energy profile differs qualitatively from that of standard RN-AdS black holes. In addition, we extend the analysis by employing thermodynamic topology to characterize the global structure of the phase space. We find that the topological charge of the singular black hole is $-1$, whereas that of the Hayward-AdS black hole becomes $+1$. This change of topological charge indicates that the constraint not only regularizes the geometry but also induces a qualitative transformation in the thermodynamic configuration space.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Dynamics as Near-Horizon AdS$_2$ Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a holographic gravitational dual for the fundamental dynamical equations governing operator growth in Krylov subspace. Specifically, we show that the deep interior of the Krylov subspace maps directly to the near-horizon regime of AdS$_2$ gravity. We demonstrate that, in the continuum limit, the discrete evolution on the Krylov chain transforms into the dynamics of a continuous field, which is isomorphic to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in the AdS$_2$ throat. This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $\alpha=\pi T$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics. Our results advance a Krylov-based holographic dictionary in a unified $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representation, revealing that the emergent geometry of Krylov subspace is a reflection of the near-horizon AdS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Localization of the BFSS matrix model and three-point amplitude in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the localization method to the BFSS matrix model with a particular class of boundary conditions, that is related to a scattering problem of 11-dimensional M-theory. For the boundary condition that corresponds to the three-point amplitude of gravitons, we exactly compute the partition function of the model based on the localization method. We find that the result correctly reproduces the expected momentum dependence of the three point amplitude.</description>

      <title>GR from RG: Gravity Is Induced From Renormalization Group Flow In The Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential in Subleading Logarithmic Approximation in Arbitrary Non-renormalizable Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the previously developed approach to the calculation of quantum corrections to the effective potential in arbitrary scalar field theories in the leading logarithmic approximation, we extended it to the next-to-leading order. Based on Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization procedure and the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk theorem, we construct recurrence relations and renormalization group equations that allow one to sum up the leading and subleading logarithms in all orders of perturbation theory. The formalism is applicable to an arbitrary scalar potential, renormalizable or not. To verify the results, we compare them with a renormalizable model treated within the standard renormalization group approach.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-minus tree-level $n$-gluon scattering amplitudes are reconsidered. Often presumed to vanish, they are shown here to be nonvanishing for certain "half-collinear" configurations existing in Klein space or for complexified momenta. We derive a piecewise-constant closed-form expression for the decay of a single minus-helicity gluon into $n-1$ plus-helicity gluons as a function of their momenta. This formula nontrivially satisfies multiple consistency conditions including Weinberg's soft theorem.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement entropy in Chern-Simons gravity with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic entanglement entropy is a key concept linking quantum information theory and gravity. Since the original conjecture of Ryu and Takayanagi, holographic entanglement entropy has been generalized beyond Einstein--Hilbert gravity to include higher-curvature corrections. In most existing generalizations, however, it is implicitly assumed that the bulk spacetime geometry is Riemannian, i.e. torsion-free. Here we propose a prescription for incorporating torsion into holographic entanglement entropy in the boundary theory dual to five-dimensional Chern--Simons gravity. We argue that the entanglement entropy acquires an additional universal divergent term proportional to the logarithm of the UV cutoff, and that this term is generated solely by torsion.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of the spherically symmetric non-topological solitons of the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma-model with a standard kinetic term and with a symmetry breaking potential in 3+1 dimensional flat space-time. We evaluate the distributions of the corresponding energy density, shear forces and pressure and study the stability criteria for these solutions. We argue that the presence of domains with negative energy density and violation of the energy conditions most likely do not lead to destabilization of solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hecke operators acting on modular functions arise naturally in the context of 2d conformal field theory, but in seemingly disparate areas, including permutation orbifold theories, ensembles of code CFTs, and more recently in the context of the AdS$_3$/RMT$_2$ program. We use an equidistribution theorem for Hecke operators to show that in each of these large $N$ limits, an entire heavy sector of the partition function gets integrated out, leaving only contributions from Poincar\'e series of light states. This gives an immediate holographic interpretation as a sum over semiclassical handlebody geometries. We speculate on further physical interpretations for equidistribution, including a potential ergodicity statement.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Transformers for Efficient and Interpretable Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attention mechanism in its standard implementation contains extraneous rotational degrees of freedom that are carried through computation but do not affect model activations or outputs. We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Thermal precondensation in gauge-fermion theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints from stratified anomalies of modulated symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.</description>

      <title>Lie dialgebras, gauge theory, and Lagrangian multiforms for integrable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiforms provide a variational framework for describing integrable hierarchies. This thesis presents two approaches for systematically constructing Lagrangian one-forms, which cover the case of finite-dimensional integrable hierarchies, thus addressing one of the central open problems in the theory of Lagrangian multiforms. The first approach, based on the theory of Lie dialgebras, incorporates into Lagrangian one-forms the notion of the classical $r$-matrix and produces Lagrangian one-forms living on coadjoint orbits. We prove an important structural result relating the closure relation for Lagrangian one-forms to the Poisson involutivity of Hamiltonians and the double zero on Euler-Lagrange equations. In the second approach, we extend the notion of Lagrangian one-forms to the setting of gauge theories and derive a variational formulation of the Hitchin system associated with a compact Riemann surface of arbitrary genus. We show that this description corresponds to a Lagrangian one-form for classical $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory coupled with so-called type A and type B defects. Notably, this establishes an explicit connection between $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory and the Hitchin system at the classical level. Further, we derive a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. As applications of the two approaches, we also obtain explicit Lagrangian one-forms for the hierarchies of various well-known integrable models.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-Pochhammer symbol $(z;q)_\infty$ as an infinite product of gamma functions, analogously to how Narukawa expressed the elliptic gamma function as an infinite product of hyperbolic gamma functions. This identity is used to obtain asymptotic expansions when $q$ tends to $1$.</description>

      <title>The absence of global anomalies of CP symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some solutions to the strong CP problem assume that CP symmetry is a gauge symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. For this scenario to be possible, the CP symmetry should not have any nonperturbative (global) anomalies. In this paper, we study anomalies of CP symmetry of fermions which are coupled to gravity and gauge fields with a gauge group $G$. When $G$ is connected and simply connected, we show that gauging a CP symmetry does not produce any new anomaly beyond the one before gauging it. In particular, the standard model matter content does not have anomalies.</description>

      <title>Producing $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in $\pi^-p$ reaction to explore their inner structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the production mechanisms of the hyperon resonances $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in the $\pi^- p$ scattering are investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach incorporating Regge trajectories. By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $\Sigma$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1405)$ and $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $\Lambda(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $\Lambda(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $\Lambda(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $\Lambda(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $\Lambda^* \to \pi \Sigma$, the Dalitz process $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K \Lambda^{*} \rightarrow K \pi \Sigma$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $\Lambda^*$ via the $K\pi\Sigma$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropic uncertainty relation and non-classicality in Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the stochastic formalism including non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate stochastic dynamics in cosmology by solving Langevin equations for Infrared (IR) modes with stochastic noises generated by Ultraviolet (UV) modes at the coarse-graining scale. By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=\lambda\phi^4$ and $V=\mu\phi\chi + \lambda\phi^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Spans and Enforced Gaplessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and fermionic statistics in nonperturbative quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation between spin and statistics in quantum field theory relies on Poincar\'e invariance, a symmetry that is lost in the presence of a gravitational field, and replaced in general relativity by the principle of general covariance. In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.</description>

We link the continuum expressions to lattice quantities by computing universal ratios of amplitudes for the two-point connectivities, and find excellent agreement with transfer-matrix numerics.</description>

      <title>Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Connection Between Cosmological And Planck Scales: The Barrow-Tsallis Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.</description>

      <title>Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved R\'enyi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged R\'enyi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Extending the Cosmological Collider: New Scaling Regimes and Constraints from BOSS</title>

Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields during inflation offers a compelling observational target. Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity.</description>

Abstract: An application of the Newton-Cartan framework to the study of membranes is presented. Specifically, for membranes of co-dimension one in hydrostatic equilibrium embedded in a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime. For such membranes, the corresponding equilibrium partition function at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion is shown. Equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations are found. For the generically non-constant elastic subset of thermodynamic coefficients, the Young-Laplace equation is presented for the case of two-dimensional axisymmetric closed membranes embedded in a flat three-dimensional spacetime with constant ambient vorticity. Some numerical solutions to this Young-Laplace equation are examined, and some analytic solutions for particular choices of the thermodynamic coefficients are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Page curves and island's delays in asymptotically flat 2d spacetimes with injections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F. F. Gautason, L. Schneiderbauer, W. Sybesma and L. Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J. G. Russo, L. Susskind and L. Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine in more detail the map between late-time correlators in de Sitter space and boundary correlators in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space, elaborating on the general construction presented in arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725 for EFTs of bosonic spinning fields. This map may be phrased as an equivalence between the generating functional of late-time correlators in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and the generating functional for boundary correlators in the corresponding EAdS theory. We extend the construction to gauge bosons and gravitons, and clarify additional subtleties that appear in even boundary dimensions. Finally, we emphasise that the relation between dS and EAdS propagators is manifest in Mellin space, and we provide new expressions for gauge-boson and graviton propagators. These results provide a streamlined framework for the study of cosmological correlators involving spinning fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetic quiver framework is proposed for studying maximal branches of 3d orthosymplectic Chern--Simons matter theories with $\mathcal{N} \geq 3$ supersymmetry, arising from Type IIB brane setups with O3 planes. These branches are extracted via brane moves, yielding orthosymplectic $\mathcal{N}=4$ magnetic quivers whose Coulomb branches match the moduli spaces of interest. Global gauge group data, inaccessible from brane configurations alone, are determined through supersymmetric indices, Hilbert series, and fugacity maps. The analysis is exploratory in nature and highlights several subtle features. In particular, magnetic quivers are proposed as predictions for the maximal branches in a range of examples.</description>

      <title>Small-$b$ expansion of the DOZZ formula for light operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point structure constant in the light-operator regime \(\alpha_i=b\sigma_i\) as \(b\to0\). In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor \({\cal P(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\) and a power series in \(b^2\): \[ C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3)={\cal P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigg[1+\sum_{n\ge1}b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigg]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic expansion of the \(\Upsilon_b\)-function we derive closed-form expressions for the leading coefficients \(\Omega_n(\sigma_i)\) and show that each \(\Omega_n\) is a symmetric polynomial in the variables \(\sigma_i\). Our expansion provides explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude. Finally, we formulate a perturbative Liouville program for celestial amplitudes and outline directions for further development.</description>

Abstract: We develop a topological framework for preparing families of non-stabilizer states, and computing their entanglement entropies, in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons theory. Using the Kac-Moody algebra, we construct Pauli and Clifford operators as path integrals over 3-manifolds with Wilson loop insertions, enabling an explicit topological realization of $W_n$ and Dicke states, as well as their entanglement properties. We further establish a correspondence between Clifford group action and modular transformations generated by Dehn twists on genus-$g$ surfaces, linking the mapping class group to quantum operations. Our results extend existing topological constructions for stabilizer states to include families of non-stabilizer states, improving the geometric interpretation of entanglement and quantum resources in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing from Ringdown Quasinormal Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is it possible to find imprints of a black hole ringdown through gravitational lensing? To address this question, we formulate an analytic description of weak-field and strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric, even-parity quasinormal mode with \(\ell=2\), \(m=0\) and complex frequency \(\omega\). Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic expansion yields the familiar weak-field \(1/b\) law with a ringdown-frequency correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities, such as centroid motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, as well as photon-ring morphology, are gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field correction. This provides an analytic account of how ringdown-scale perturbations enter imaging observables, without resorting to numerical integration of null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Analytic Computation of Dilaton Black Hole Quasinormal Modes via Seiberg-Witten Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spacetime singularity at $t = 0$ arising in a Kasner-type metric that solves the gravitational equations modified by quantum effects of a conformal field theory (CFT). The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $\eta = A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: the fermionic logarithmic negativity is non-vanishing at finite temperature, and is monotonically suppressed by thermal noise. As a function of the electric field, it is non-monotonic, featuring a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_*$ and decreasing on both sides of the maximum. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature Casimir effect for parallel plates in the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $\kappa$-scalar field, we compute the $\kappa$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. Our analysis yields an upper bound on the deformation parameter as $a\leq10^{-18}m$. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-commutative effects become experimentally observable in Casimir effect studies when the ratio of the non-commutative scale to plate separation satisfies $a/L\leq 10^{-12}$. We also obtain the expression for Stefan-Boltzmann's law in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time.</description>

      <title>Curvatures and Non-metricities in the Non-Relativistic Limit of Bosonic Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a diffeomorphism-covariant formulation of the non-relativistic (NR) limit of bosonic supergravity. This formulation is particularly useful for decomposing relativistic tensors, such as powers of the Riemann tensor, in a manifest covariant form with respect to the NR degrees of freedom. The construction is purely geometrical and is based on a torsionless connection. The non-metricities are associated with the gravitational fields of the theory ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $h_{\mu\nu}$, $\tau^{\mu\nu}$, $h^{\mu\nu}$) and are fixed by requiring compatibility with the relativistic metric. We provide a fully covariant decomposition of the relativistic Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature. Our results establish an equivalence between the intrinsic torsion framework of string Newton--Cartan geometry and the proposed construction and. We also discuss potential applications, including a manifestly diffeomorphism-covariant rewriting of the two-derivative finite bosonic supergravity Lagrangian under the NR limit, a powerful simplification in deriving bosonic $\alpha'$-corrections under the same limit, and extensions to more general $f(R,Q)$ Newton-Cartan geometries.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Topological Charge Asymmetry in a $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$ Skyrmion-Fermion Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology plays a central role in classifying solitonic configurations in field theories, providing robustness and a nonperturbative label, the so-called topological charge $Q$. In soliton-fermion coupled systems, the relation between the topological charge and the number of zero modes is well established through the index theorem. However, the physical consequences of the sign of the topological charge have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study fermions in $2+1$ dimensions coupled to Skyrmions with target space $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$, particularly focusing on the backreactions of the fermions and on the sign of the topological charge. We obtain the solutions in a self-consistent manner, which exhibit an asymmetry with respect to the topological charge $\pm Q$ especially in the strong coupling regimes. This asymmetry is caused from the fermionic eigenvalue problem inherent in the self-consistent formulation. Although the Lagrangian is symmetric under $Q\to-Q$, the coupled equations for the Skyrmions and anti-Skyrmions become inequivalent once fermionic backreaction is taken into account. We demonstrate the mechanism in $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^1$ and $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ Skyrmions, but the analysis is directly extendable for the general $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general framework for constructing $2n$-site chiral integrable matrix product states in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena spin chain, based on reflection equations and the fusion procedure. For four-site chiral integrable product states, we propose their exact overlap formulas with Bethe states. We also investigate the chiral integrable subspaces numerically.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.
  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.
  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.</description>

Abstract: We investigate stationary, non-axisymmetric black hole solutions in AdS$_3$ gravity, known as black flower geometries, in the Chern-Simons formulation. Boundary conditions are specified by a collective field theory-inspired Hamiltonian with field-dependent chemical potentials and angularly inhomogeneous boundary data. We construct a tractable class of solutions and analyze their geometric and thermodynamic properties, obtaining an entropy with nontrivial dependence on the angular deformation. Upon quantization of the boundary theory via bosonization, the boundary degrees of freedom are mapped to relativistic free fermions. We explicitly construct and count the microstates associated with a given black flower geometry and find exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

Abstract: We present and investigate charged wormhole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations supported by anisotropic matter fields, with the purpose of establishing their physical plausibility as traversable wormholes. To this end, we examine the flare-out condition and evaluate tidal forces to confirm their traversability. We also analyze light deflection around these wormholes to provide observational implications. Additionally, we attempt to construct rotating generalizations of the solutions by applying and modifying the Newman-Janis algorithm. Our results suggest that the obtained geometries offer a concrete realization of the concept of ``charge without charge".</description>

      <title>Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density. This quantity can be influenced by ambient factors, following which, in this work we have investigated the impact of dark matter environment on the merger statistics. We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and freeze-out production of Higgs portal Majorana fermionic dark matter during and after reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton ($\phi$) into a pair of fermions $f$ and $\bar f$ via the interaction $y\,\phi\,\bar f\,f$, where $y$ is the dimensionless Yukawa coupling. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. Our framework unifies examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.</description>

      <title>Dense matter in a holographic hard-wall model of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deeper understanding of QCD matter at strong coupling remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature. To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Border bases are a generalization of Gr\"obner bases for zero-dimensional ideals in polynomial rings. In this article, we introduce border bases for a non-commutative ring of linear differential operators, namely the rational Weyl algebra. We elaborate on their properties and present algorithms to compute with them. We apply this theory to represent integrable connections as cyclic $D$-modules explicitly. As an application, we visit differential equations behind a string, a Feynman as well as a cosmological integral. We also address the classification of particular $D$-ideals of a fixed holonomic rank, namely the case of linear PDEs with constant coefficients as well as Frobenius ideals. Our approach rests on the theory of Hilbert schemes of points in affine space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</description>

      <title>Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

Abstract: We report new constraints on the parameters of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity, derived from its imprints on neutrino flavor oscillations. Our analysis reveals that the presence of spacetime torsion can alter both vacuum oscillations and the matter enhanced Mikheyev Smirnov Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance. By using data from solar neutrino experiments: Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we perform a combined analysis to place the first direct observational bounds on the neutrino-torsion coupling and $f(T)$ parameters. These results establish neutrino phenomenology as a novel astrophysical probe for testing fundamental modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>
