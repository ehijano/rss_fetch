      <title>Continuity and Monotonicity of Preferences and Probabilistic Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that probabilistic equivalence of a regret-based preference relationship over random variables is implied by a weak form of continuity and monotonicity.</description>

      <title>The Power of Simple Menus in Robust Selling Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a robust selling problem where a seller attempts to sell one item to a buyer but is uncertain about the buyer's valuation distribution. Existing literature shows that robust screening provides a stronger theoretical guarantee than robust deterministic pricing, but at the expense of implementation complexity, as it requires a menu of infinite options. Our research aims to find simple mechanisms to hedge against market ambiguity effectively. We develop a general framework for robust selling mechanisms with a finite menu (or randomization across finite prices). We propose a tractable reformulation that addresses various ambiguity sets of the buyer's valuation distribution, including support, mean, and quantile ambiguity sets. We derive optimal selling mechanisms and corresponding performance ratios for different menu sizes, showing that even a modest menu size can deliver benefits similar to those achieved by the optimal robust mechanism with infinite options, establishing a favorable trade-off between theoretical performance and implementation simplicity. Remarkably, a menu size of merely two can significantly enhance the performance ratio compared to deterministic pricing.</description>

      <title>Implementing Evidence Acquisition: Time Dependence in Contracts for Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An expert with no inherent interest in an unknown binary state can exert effort to acquire a piece of falsifiable evidence informative of it. A designer can incentivize learning using a mechanism that provides state-dependent rewards within fixed bounds. We show that eliciting a single report maximizes information acquisition if the evidence is revealing or its content predictable. This conclusion fails when the evidence is sufficiently imprecise, the failure to find it is informative, and its contents could support either state. Our findings shed light on incentive design for consultation and forecasting by showing how learning dynamics qualitatively shape effort-maximizing contracts.</description>

      <title>Information Greenhouse: Optimal Persuasion for Medical Test-Avoiders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patients often delay or reject medical tests due to information avoidance, which hinders timely reception of necessary treatments. This paper studies the optimal information policy to persuade an information-avoidant patient to undergo the test and make the best choice that maximizes his health. The patient sequentially decides whether to take the test and the optimal treatment plan. The information provided is about the background knowledge of the disease, and disclosure can take place both before and after the test decision. The optimal information policy depends on whether the patient is willing to be tested when he is completely pessimistic. If so, the optimal policy features warning-in-advance: the disclosure only takes place before the test, and the bad news guarantees the patient to be tested and be treated even without further information. If not, the optimal policy constructs an information greenhouse: an information structure that provides high anticipatory utility is committed when the patient is tested and the test result is bad. Extensions to ex ante participation constraint and general information preference are also considered.</description>
