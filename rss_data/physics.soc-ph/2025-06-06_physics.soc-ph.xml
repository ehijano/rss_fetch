      <title>What does making money have to do with crime?: A dive into the National Crime Victimization survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models. The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Index Report 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inaugural edition of the MIT Quantum Index Report (QIR). Quantum technologies are evolving from theoretical concepts into tangible technologies with commercial promise. Their rapid progress is capturing global attention and suggests we stand on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. Unlocking the quantum opportunity is not simple. One challenge is that quantum technologies can present a high barrier to understanding for nonexperts because they often rely on complex principles and concepts from a variety of specialist fields. This can lead to confusion and intimidation for business leaders, educators, policymakers and others. The Quantum Index Report aims to reduce the complexity and make it possible for a wider audience to have a deeper understanding of the quantum landscape. The Quantum Index Report provides a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of the state of quantum technologies. For this inaugural edition we have focused on quantum computing and networking. The report tracks, measures, and visualizes trends across research, development, education and public acceptance. It aggregates data from academia, industry and policy sources and aims to provide nonpartisan insights.</description>

      <title>Direct reciprocity in asynchronous interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is vital for the survival of living systems but is challenging due to the costs borne by altruistic individuals. Direct reciprocity, where actions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation. However, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world interactions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This asynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and Win-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts, it is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous interactions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous stochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic environmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which strategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the order of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony generally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where environmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When environmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal strategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold, any cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work underscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary processes and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in stabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Silos of Digitalization and Sustainability by Twin Transition: A Multivocal Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin transition is the method of parallel digital and sustainability transitions in a mutually supporting way or, in common terms, "greening of and by IT and data." Twin transition reacts to the growing problem of unsustainable digitalization, particularly in the ecological sense. Ignoring this problem will eventually limit the digital adeptness of society and the problem-solving capacity of humankind. Information systems engineering must find ways to support twin transition journeys through its substantial body of knowledge, methods, and techniques. To this end, we systematically survey the academic and gray literature on twin transition, clarify key concepts, and derive leads for researchers and practitioners to steer their innovation efforts.</description>

      <title>Complexity in the Wake of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate quantitatively, albeit in arbitrary units, the evolution of complexity of the human system since the domestication of fire. This is made possible by studying the timing of the 14 most important milestones, breaks in historical perspective, in the evolution of humans. AI is considered here as the latest such milestone with importance comparable to that of the Internet. The complexity is modeled to have evolved along a bell-shaped curve, reaching a maximum around our times, and soon entering a declining trajectory. According to this curve, the next evolutionary milestone of comparable importance is expected around 2050 and should add less complexity than AI but more than the milestone grouping together nuclear energy, DNA, and the transistor. The peak of the complexity curve coincides squarely with the life span of the baby boomers. The peak in the rate of growth of the world population precedes the complexity peak by 25 years, which is about the time it takes a young man or woman before they are able to add complexity to the human system in a significant way. It is in society's interest to flatten the complexity bell-shaped curve to whatever extent this is possible in order enjoy complexity longer.</description>

      <title>Nombre Effectif de Partis Politiques en Afrique: Une Nouvelle M\'ethode pour un Calcul Objectif et Institutionnellement Neutre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political fragmentation in Africa poses to a significant challenge to effective governance and stability. Traditional measures of party system fragmentation, such as the Effective Number of Parties (ENP) index, often fail to capture the nuanced realities of African political landscapes, particularly the influence of dominant parties, fluid party affiliations, and the impact of ethnic and regional cleavages. To address these limitations, this paper introduces two novel "apolitical" or "institutionally neutral" measures for calculating the effective number of parties, focusing on geographical and demographic dimensions, notably population size and territorial area. By incorporating these local realities and ensuring a minimum threshold of two parties, the proposed models offer a simpler and more contextually relevant framework for understanding political dynamics in Africa, especially in data-scarce environments. This approach provides a valuable tool for analyzing and streamlining political systems, with potential for broader application beyond the African context.</description>

      <title>Edge interventions can mitigate demographic and prestige disparities in the Computer Science coauthorship network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social factors such as demographic traits and institutional prestige structure the creation and dissemination of ideas in academic publishing. One place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in network centrality in a hand-collected data set of 5,670 U.S.-based faculty employed in Ph.D.-granting Computer Science departments and their DBLP coauthorship connections. We introduce algorithms for combining name- and perception-based demographic labels by maximizing alignment with self-reported demographics from a survey of faculty from our census. We find that women and individuals with minoritized race identities are less central in the computer science coauthorship network, implying worse access to and ability to spread information. Centrality is also highly correlated with prestige, such that faculty in top-ranked departments are at the core and those in low-ranked departments are in the peripheries of the computer science coauthorship network. We show that these disparities can be mitigated using simulated edge interventions, interpreted as facilitated collaborations. Our intervention increases the centrality of target individuals, chosen independently of the network structure, by linking them with researchers from highly ranked institutions. When applied to scholars during their Ph.D., the intervention also improves the predicted rank of their placement institution in the academic job market. This work was guided by an ameliorative approach: uncovering social inequities in order to address them. By targeting scholars for intervention based on institutional prestige, we are able to improve their centrality in the coauthorship network that plays a key role in job placement and longer-term academic success.</description>

      <title>Memory-Driven Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics: A Hegselmann-Krause Model Based on Fractional-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states. Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference, a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both theoretical significance and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing educational opportunity hoarding: the emergence of hoarding without hoarders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social scientists increasingly use the concept of opportunity hoarding to explain the formation of Black-White educational inequalities. However, this concept is often loosely defined, leading to varied interpretations of the inequality-producing mechanisms it captures. To bring clarity to this valuable sociological concept, this theoretical paper, informed by the concept's original definition and existing empirical research, proposes a more precise definition of opportunity hoarding and formalizes it through a computational model. For concreteness, the model focuses on one context: how White families can hoard access to advanced high school coursework from Black students attending the same school. Through simulations, the paper highlights the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of advanced course-taking opportunities emerges. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to traditional accounts, White actors do not need to engage in exclusionary behaviors to hoard valuable resources. Rather, through the byproduct of network segregation and class inequalities, opportunity hoarding can emerge even when individuals act in race-neutral ways -- a process I conceptualize as hoarding without hoarders.</description>

      <title>Community Aware Temporal Network Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advantages of temporal networks in capturing complex dynamics, such as diffusion and contagion, has led to breakthroughs in real world systems across numerous fields. In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets.</description>
