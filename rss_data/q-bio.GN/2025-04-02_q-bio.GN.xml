      <title>Celler:A Genomic Language Model for Long-Tailed Single-Cell Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in single-cell technology have ushered in unparalleled opportunities to decode the molecular intricacy of intricate biological systems, especially those linked to diseases unique to humans. However, these progressions have also ushered in novel obstacles-specifically, the efficient annotation of extensive, long-tailed single-cell data pertaining to disease conditions. To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a state-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the annotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking elements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By dynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the model's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of overfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard Data Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting the challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in this field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75, which encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases. This dataset provides critical support for comprehensively exploring the potential of single-cell technology in disease research.

      <title>LOCO-EPI: Leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) as a benchmarking paradigm for deep learning based prediction of enhancer-promoter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00306</link>

Abstract: In mammalian and vertebrate genomes, the promoter regions of the gene and their distal enhancers may be located millions of base-pairs from each other, while a promoter may not interact with the closest enhancer. Since base-pair proximity is not a good indicator of these interactions, there is considerable work toward developing methods for predicting Enhancer-Promoter Interactions (EPI). Several machine learning methods have reported increasingly higher accuracies for predicting EPI. Typically, these approaches randomly split the dataset of Enhancer-Promoter (EP) pairs into training and testing subsets followed by model training. However, the aforementioned random splitting causes information leakage by assigning EP pairs from the same genomic region to both testing and training sets, leading to performance overestimation. In this paper we propose to use a more thorough training and testing paradigm i.e., Leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) cross-validation for EPI-prediction. We demonstrate that a deep learning algorithm, which gives higher accuracies when trained and tested on random-splitting setting, drops drastically in performance under LOCO setting, confirming overestimation of performance. We further propose a novel hybrid deep neural network for EPI-prediction that fuses k-mer features of the nucleotide sequence. We show that the hybrid architecture performs significantly better in the LOCO setting, demonstrating it can learn more generalizable aspects of EP interactions. With this paper we are also releasing the LOCO splitting-based EPI dataset. Research data is available in this public repository: https://github.com/malikmtahir/EPI</description>

      <title>GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions. Implementation details and supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GenerTeam/GENERator.</description>
