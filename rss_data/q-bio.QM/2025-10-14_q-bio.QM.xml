      <title>Interval-Censored Survival Analysis of Grapevine Phenology: Thermal Controls on Flowering and Fruit Ripening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: European grapevine (\textit{Vitis vinifera} L.) is a climate-sensitive perennial whose flowering and ripening govern yield and quality. Phenological records from monitoring programs are typically collected at irregular intervals, so true transition dates are interval-censored, and many site-years are right-censored. We develop a reproducible workflow that treats phenology as a time-to-event outcome: Status \&amp; Intensity observations from the USA-NPN are converted to interval bounds, linked to NASA POWER daily weather, and analyzed with parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull and log-logistic). To avoid outcome-dependent bias from aggregating weather up to the event date, antecedent conditions are summarized in fixed pre-season windows and standardized; quality-control filters ensure adequate within-window data coverage. Applied to flowering and ripening of \textit{V.~vinifera}, the framework yields interpretable time-ratio effects and publication-ready tables and figures. Warmer pre-season conditions are associated with earlier ripening, whereas flowering responses are modest and uncertain in these data; precipitation plays, at most, a secondary role. The approach demonstrates how interval-censored survival models with exogenous weather windows can extract robust climate signals from citizen-science phenology while preserving observation uncertainty, and it generalizes readily to other species and networks.</description>

      <title>MS2toImg: A Framework for Direct Bioactivity Prediction from Raw LC-MS/MS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Untargeted metabolomics using LC-MS/MS offers the potential to comprehensively profile the chemical diversity of biological samples. However, the process is fundamentally limited by the "identification bottleneck," where only a small fraction of detected features can be annotated using existing spectral libraries, leaving the majority of data uncharacterized and unused. In addition, the inherently low reproducibility of LC-MS/MS instruments introduces alignment errors between runs, making feature alignment across large datasets both error-prone and challenging. To overcome these constraints, we developed a deep learning method that eliminates the requirement for metabolite identification and reduces the influence of alignment inaccuracies. Here, we propose MS2toImg, a method that converts raw LC-MS/MS data into a two-dimensional images representing the global fragmentation pattern of each sample. These images are then used as direct input for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling end-to-end prediction of biological activity without explicit feature engineering or alignment. Our approach was validated using wild soybean samples and multiple bioactivity assays (e.g., DPPH, elastase inhibition). The MS2toImg-CNN model outperformed conventional machine learning baselines (e.g., Random Forest, PCA), demonstrating robust classification accuracy across diverse tasks. By transforming raw spectral data into images, our framework is inherently less sensitive to alignment errors caused by low instrument reproducibility, as it leverages the overall fragmentation landscape rather than relying on precise feature matching. This identification-free, image-based approach enables more robust and scalable bioactivity prediction from untargeted metabolomics data, offering a new paradigm for high-throughput functional screening in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Domain Knowledge Infused Generative Models for Drug Discovery Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing in every stage of drug development. Nevertheless, a major challenge in drug discovery AI remains: Drug pharmacokinetic (PK) and Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) datasets collected in different studies often exhibit limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Thus, data curation becomes difficult, negatively impacting downstream research investigations in high-throughput screening, polypharmacy, and drug combination. We propose xImagand-DKI, a novel SMILES/Protein-to-Pharmacokinetic/DTI (SP2PKDTI) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK and DTI target properties conditioned on SMILES and protein inputs that exhibit data overlap sparsity. We infuse additional molecular and genomic domain knowledge from the Gene Ontology (GO) and molecular fingerprints to further improve our model performance. We show that xImagand-DKI-generated synthetic PK data closely resemble real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and can adequately fill in gaps among PK and DTI datasets. As such, xImagand-DKI is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and may improve performance for downstream drug discovery research tasks.

      <title>SeFEF: A Seizure Forecasting Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work, we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development, assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.
  The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key deterministic and probabilistic metrics.
  Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling, calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that could affect the comparability of different approaches.
  As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation, and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.</description>

      <title>Combined Representation and Generation with Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</description>

      <title>An uncertainty-aware framework for data-efficient multi-view animal pose estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.</description>

      <title>Augmenting generative models with biomedical knowledge graphs improves targeted drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>A clustering algorithm for the single cell analysis of mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic clustering algorithm is proposed for the analysis of forensic DNA mixtures in which individual cells are isolated and short tandem repeats are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction to generate single cell electropherograms. The task of the algorithm is to use the peak height information in the electropherograms to group the cells according to their contributors. Using a recently developed experimental set of individual cell electropherograms, a large set of simulations shows that the proposed clustering algorithm has excellent performance in correctly grouping single cells, and for assigning likelihood ratios for persons of interest (of known genotype).</description>

      <title>Does Re-referencing Matter? Large Laplacian Filter Optimizes Single-Trial P300 BCI Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, enabling Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication and control. However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian &gt; CAR &gt; no re-reference &gt; small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Simplicity: How Reducing EEG Electrodes Affects Source Localization and BCI Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values. This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data, demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where availability of unlabelled data could increase.</description>

      <title>The role of oscillations in grid cells' toroidal topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology applied to the activity of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex suggests that this activity lies on a toroidal manifold. By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ($\sim$ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by $\sim$ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, $A_{\eta}/A_{\theta}$, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Structural Identifiability of Epidemic Models Using StructuralIdentifiability.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural identifiability is the theoretical ability to uniquely recover model parameters from ideal, noise-free data. Importantly, it is a prerequisite for reliable parameter estimation in epidemic modeling. Despite its relevance in model calibration and parameter inference, it remains underused and inconsistently addressed in the infectious disease modeling literature. This paper provides a methodological tutorial that combines hands-on instruction with new strategies for communicating identifiability results. We present a reproducible workflow for conducting structural identifiability analysis of ordinary differential equation models using the Julia package \texttt{StructuralIdentifiability.jl}. We demonstrate the workflow on a range of epidemic models, including SEIR variants with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, vector-borne systems, and models incorporating hospitalization and disease-induced mortality. In addition to worked examples, we introduce a novel visualization approach that embeds identifiability information directly into compartmental diagrams, enhancing clarity for both research and teaching. Our results highlight how identifiability depends on model structure, the availability of initial conditions, and the choice of observed states. By combining practical guidance, comparative insights, and visual communication tools, this tutorial serves as both a reference and a pedagogical resource for researchers and educators. it also provides a reproducible and adaptable framework that can be readily integrated into teaching materials, workshops, and graduate-level modeling courses to strengthen understanding of identifiability concepts and best practices in epidemic modeling. All code and annotated diagrams are publicly available in our GitHub repository.</description>

Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1. We sample new antibody variants with the top-performing models, rank them by the structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex, and assess them with in vitro ELISA binding assays. Our findings show that structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.</description>

      <title>Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry</title>

Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.</description>

      <title>Continuous body 3-D reconstruction of limbless animals</title>

Abstract: Limbless animals such as snakes, limbless lizards, worms, eels, and lampreys move their slender, long bodies in three dimensions to traverse diverse environments. Accurately quantifying their continuous body's 3-D shape and motion is important for understanding body-environment interactions in complex terrain, but this is difficult to achieve (especially for local orientation and rotation). Here, we describe an interpolation method to quantify continuous body 3-D position and orientation. We simplify the body as an elastic rod and apply a backbone optimization method to interpolate continuous body shape between end constraints imposed by tracked markers. Despite over-simplifying the biomechanics, our method achieves a higher interpolation accuracy (~50% error) in both 3-D position and orientation compared with the widely-used cubic B-spline interpolation method. Beyond snakes traversing large obstacles as demonstrated, our method applies to other long, slender, limbless animals and continuum robots. We provide codes and demo files for easy application of our method.</description>

      <title>Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 8 to 32 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.</description>

      <title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials ("fallen angels").</description>
