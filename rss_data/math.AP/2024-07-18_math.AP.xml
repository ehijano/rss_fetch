      <title>Boundary fractional Hardy's inequality in dimension one: The critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove fractional boundary Hardy's inequality in dimension one for the critical case $sp =1$. Optimality of the inequality is obtained for any $p$. The extra logarithmic correction term appears in usual fashion. We also provide a concrete (workable) example of a sequence of smooth functions that converges to constant function in $W^{s,p}((0,1))$ for $sp=1$ and $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the subelliptic heat kernel on $\operatorname{SU}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heat kernel rigidity for the Lie group $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$ kernel equipped with a sub-Riemannian structure. We prove that a metric measure space equipped with a heat kernel of a special form is bundle-isometric to the Hopf fibration $\operatorname{U}\left( 1 \right)\to \operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)\to \mathbb{CP}^1$, which coincides with the sub-Riemannian sphere $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional coefficient inverse problems by transformation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness for an inverse problem of determining a matrix coefficient $P(x)$ of a system of evolution equations $\sigma \ppp_t u = \ppp_x^2 u(t,x) - P(x) u(t,x)$ for $0&lt;x&lt;\ell$ and $0&lt;t&lt;T$, where $\ell&gt;0$ and $T&gt;0$ are arbitrarily given. The uniqueness results assert that two solutions have the same Cauchy data at $x=0$ over $(0,T)$ and the same initial value or the final value which is positive on $[0,\ell]$, then the zeroth-order coefficient is uniquely determined on $[0,\ell]$. The uniqueness for inverse coefficient problem for a system of evolution equations without boundary conditions over the whole boundary is an open problem even in the one-dimension in the case where only initial value is given as spatial data. Moreover, in the case of the zero initial condition, we prove the uniqueness in the half of the spatial interval.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for the periodic Kadomtsev--Petviashvili--II equation below $L^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Bourgain's $L^2$-wellposedness result for the KP-II equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to initial data with negative Sobolev regularity. The key ingredient is a new linear $L^4$-Strichartz estimate which is effective on frequency-dependent time scales. The $L^4$-Strichartz estimates follow from combining an $\ell^2$-decoupling inequality recently proved by Guth--Maldague--Oh with semiclassical Strichartz estimates. Moreover, we rely on a variant of Bourgain's bilinear Strichartz estimate on frequency-dependent times, which is proved via the C\'ordoba--Fefferman square function estimate.</description>

      <title>$L_1$ approach to the compressible viscous fluid flows in general domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the $L_1$ in time and $B^{s+1}_{q,1}\times B^s_{q,1}$ in space maximal regularity for the Stokes equations in the viscous compressible fluid flows in domains in the $N$ dimensional Euclidean space $R^N$ whose boundary is $C^3$ compact hypersurface. As an application, the local well-posedness is proved for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Dirichlet condition. Danchin and Tolksdorf have studied the same problem in a bounded domains. Since they used Da-Prato and Grisvard theory directly, they need the assumption that the domain is compact. We imvestigate a new method to obtain $L_1$ maximal regularity which is based on real interpolation theories and thanks to this method, we can remove the compactness assumptions in the study due to Danchin and Torksdorf. Our method can be applied to obtain $L_1$ in time maximal regularity theorem for the initial boundary value problem of the system of parabolic or hyperbolic-parabolic equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of the Higher-Order Maxwell-Stefan Model of Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the study is to compare the standard Maxwell-Stefan model of diffusion with the higher-order one recently derived. This higher-order model takes into account the influence of the complete pressure tensor. A numerical scheme is developed for comparing the two models through numerical simulations of three-component diffusion. It is shown that the higher-order model preserves qualitative features of the diffusion process, but quantitative differences were observed in the behavior of the mixture components.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for Dirac equations in Aharonov-Bohm magnetic fields: massless case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dispersive properties of a two dimensional massless Dirac equation perturbed by an Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field. Our main results will be a family of pointwise decay estimates and a full range family Strichartz estimates for the flow. The proof relies on the use of a relativistic Hankel transform, which allows for an explicit representation of the propagator in terms of the generalized eigenfunctions of the operator. These results represent the natural continuation of earlier research on evolution equations associated to operators with magnetic fields with strong singularities (see \cite{DF, FFFP, FZZ} where the Schr\"odinger and the wave equations were studied). Indeed, we recall the fact that the Aharonov--Bohm field represents a perturbation which is critical with respect to the scaling: this fact, as it is well known, makes the analysis particularly challenging.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation in an exterior domain with general boundary conditions I. The case of integrable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the heat equation in exterior domains, i.e., domains which are the complement of a smooth compact set in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Different homogeneous boundary conditions are considered, including Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann conditions for integrable initial data in $L^1(\Omega)$. After taking into account the loss of mass of the solution through the boundary, depending on the boundary conditions, we describe the asymptotic spatial distribution of the remaining mass in terms of the Gaussian and of a suitable asymptotic profile function. We show that our results have optimal time rates.</description>

      <title>A fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality of Michael-Simon type on convex hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12439v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a fractional version of a Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type interpolation inequality on hypersurfaces $M\subset\R^{n+1}$ which are boundaries of convex sets. The inequality carries a universal constant independent of $M$ and involves the fractional mean curvature of $M.$ In particular, it interpolates between the fractional Micheal-Simon Sobolev inequality recently obtained by Cabr\'e, Cozzi, and the first author, and a new fractional Hardy inequality on $M$. Our method, when restricted to the plane case $M=\R^n$, gives a new simple proof of the fractional Hardy inequality. To obtain the fractional Hardy inequality on a hypersurface, we establish an inequality which bounds a weighted perimeter of $M$ by the standard perimeter of $M$ (modulo a universal constant), and which is valid for all convex hypersurfaces $M$.</description>

      <title>Composite solutions to a liquid bilayer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12477v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article continues the research initiated in [17]. We derive explicit formulae for the leading order profiles of eleven types of stationary solutions to a one-dimensional two-layer thin-film liquid model considered with an intermolecular potential depending on both layer heights. The found solutions are composed of the repeated elementary blocks (bulk, contact line and ultra-thin film ones) being consistently asymptotically matched together. We show that once considered on a finite interval with Neumann boundary conditions these stationary solutions are either dynamically stable or weakly translationally unstable. Other composite solutions are found to be numerically unstable and rather exhibit complex coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations on Riemannian Manifolds via Lyapunov control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new perspective on the existence of viscosity solutions for a stationary and a time-dependent first order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Following recent comparison principles, we work in a framework in which we consider a subsolution and a supersolution for two equations in terms of two Hamiltonians that can be seen as an upper and lower bound of our original Hamiltonian respectively. The upper and lower bound are formulated in terms of a relaxed Lyapunov function which allows us to restrict part of the analysis to compact sets and to work with almost optimizers of the considered control problems. For this reason, we can relax assumptions on the control problem: most notably, we do not need completeness of set of controlled paths. Moreover, our strategy avoids a-priori analysis on the regularity of the candidate solutions. We then explore the context of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations to verify our assumptions in a convex and non-convex setting respectively.</description>

      <title>$d$-dimensional extension of a penalization method for Neumann or Robin boundary conditions: a boundary layer approach and numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the $d$-dimensional extension of a fictitious domain penalization technique that we previously proposed for Neumann or Robin boundary conditions. We apply Droniou's approach for non-coercive linear elliptic problems to obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the penalized problem, and we derive a boundary layer approach to establish the convergence of the penalization method. The developed boundary layer approach is adapted from the one used for Dirichlet boundary conditions, but in contrast to the latter where coercivity enables a straightforward estimate of the remainders, we reduce the convergence of the penalization method to the existence of suitable supersolutions of a dual problem. These supersolutions are then constructed as approximate solutions of the dual problem using an additional formal boundary layer approach. The proposed approach results in an advection-dominated problem, requiring the use of appropriate numerical methods suitable for singular perturbation problems. Numerical experiments, using upwind finite differences, validate both the convergence rate and the boundary layer thickness, illuminating the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A note on the logarithmically perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on $\mathbb{H^N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N}u+\lambda u +|u|^{p-1}u+\theta u \ln u^2 =0, \ \ \ \ u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N), \ u &gt; 0 \ \text{in} \ \mathbb{B}^N.
  \end{align*}
  and study the existence vs non-existence results. We show that whenever $\theta &gt;0,$ there exists an $H^1$-solution, while for $\theta &lt;0$, there does not exist a positive solution in a reasonably general class. Since the perturbation $ u \ln u^2$ changes sign, Pohozaev type identities do not yield any non-existence results. The main contribution of this article is obtaining an ``almost" precise lower asymptotic decay estimate on the positive solutions for $\theta &lt;0,$ culminating in proving their non-existence assertion.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity limit for hyperbolic system of Temple class in 1-d with nonlinear viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hyperbolic system with nonlinear viscosity such that the viscosity matrix $B(u)$ is commutating with $A(u)$ the matrix associated to the convective term. The drift matrix is assumed to be Temple class. First, we prove the global existence of smooth solutions for initial data with small total variation. We show that the solution to the parabolic equation converges to a semi-group solution of the hyperbolic system as viscosity goes to zero. Furthermore, we prove that the zero diffusion limit coincides with the one obtained in [Bianchini and Bressan, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 2000].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a structure-preserving discretisation for the recently studied Cahn-Hilliard-Biot system using conforming finite elements in space and problem-adapted explicit-implicit Euler time integration. We prove that the scheme preserves the thermodynamic structure, that is, the balance of mass and volumetric fluid content and the energy dissipation balance. The existence of discrete solutions is established under suitable growth conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithm can be realised as a splitting method, that is, decoupling the Cahn-Hilliard subsystem from the poro-elasticity subsystem, while the first one is nonlinear and the second subsystem is linear. The schemes are illustrated by numerical examples and a convergence test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a link between the virial theorem in functional analysis and the method of multipliers in theory of partial differential equations. After giving a physical insight into the techniques, we show how to use them to deduce the absence of eigenvalues and other spectral properties of electromagnetic quantum Hamiltonians. We focus on our recent developments in non-self-adjoint settings, namely on Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials, relativistic operators of Pauli and Dirac types, and complex Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a boundary control problem for the evolutionary Navier-Stokes equations, under mixed boundary conditions, in two dimensions. The cost functional here considered is of quadratic type, depending on both state and control variables. We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to address the analysis and the derivation of a system of first-order optimality conditions that characterizes the solution of the control problem. We take advantage of an adequate treatment of the Dirichlet control through the study of the reduced functional. Despite the fact that this approach is quite common, a detailed analysis for the case of mixed boundary conditions with is still lacking. Finally, solution-finding algorithms of descent type are proposed and illustrated with several simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fully nonlinear dead-core systems coupled with strong absorption terms. We discover a chain reaction, exploiting properties of an equation along the system and obtain higher sharp regularity across the free boundary. Additionally, we prove geometric measure estimates and obtain coincidence of the free boundaries. We also derive Liouville type theorems for entire solutions. These results are new even for linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two systems of two conservation laws that are defined on complementary spatial intervals and coupled by an interface as a single port-Hamiltonian system. In case of a fixed interface position, we characterize the boundary and interface conditions for which the associated port-Hamiltonian operator generates a contraction semigroup. Furthermore, we present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the generated $C_0$-semigroup. The results are illustrated by the example of two acoustic waveguides coupled by an interface consisting of some membrane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysteresis in the pressure-saturation relation in unsaturated porous media, owing to surface tension on the liquid-gas interface, exhibits strong degeneracy in the resulting mass balance equation. As an extension of previous existence and uniqueness results, we prove that under physically admissible initial conditions and without mass exchange with the exterior, the unique global solution of the fluid diffusion problem exists and asymptotically converges as time tends to infinity to a possibly non-homogeneous mass distribution and an a priori unknown constant pressure.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, it was recently known that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-bounds of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not for any $3 \le p \le \infty$.
  In the third kind resonance case, we still show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generally unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. However, it can be also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ remain bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has a zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonance and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$.
  These results precisely describle all $L^p$-bounds of the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some exceptions of the endpoint cases for $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. As a result, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <title>On the instability of travelling wave solutions for the transport-Stokes equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the instability of the spherical travelling wave solutions for the Transport-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$. First, a classical scaling argument ensures instability among all probability measures for the Wasserstein metric and the $L^1$ norm. Secondly, we address the instability among patch solutions with a perturbed surface. To this end, we study the linearized system of a contour dynamics equation derived in [18] in the case where the support of the patch is axisymmetric and described by spherical parametrization. We investigate numerically the existence of positive eigenvalues, which ensures the instability of the linearized system. Eventually we recover numerically the instability of the travelling wave by solving the Transport-Stokes equation using a finite element method on FreeFem.</description>

      <title>Homogenization and simulation of heat transfer through a thin grain layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the effective influence of grain structures on the heat transfer between a fluid and solid domain using mathematical homogenization. The presented model consists of heat equations inside the different domains, coupled through either perfect or imperfect thermal contact. The size and the period of the grains are of order $\varepsilon$, therefore forming a thin layer. The equation parameters inside the grains also depend on $\varepsilon$. We considered two distinct scenarios: Case (a), where the grains are disconnected, and Case (b), where the grains form a connected geometry but in a way such that the fluid and solid are still in contact. In both cases, we determined the effective differential equations for the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ via the concept of two-scale convergence for thin layers. We also presented and studied a numerical algorithm to solve the homogenized problem.</description>

      <title>Classification Theorem For Positive Critical Points Of Sobolev Trace Inequality</title>

Abstract: We consider the Euler-Lagrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality and prove several classification results. Exploiting the moving sphere method, it has been shown, when $p=2$, positive solutions of Euler-Lagrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality are classified. Since the moving sphere method strongly relies on the symmetries of the equation, in this paper we use asymptotic estimates and two important integral identities to classify positive solutions of Euler-Langrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality under finite energy when $1&lt;p&lt;n$.</description>

We also demonstrate the existence of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T)$.

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for a volume-filling model of cell invasion into extracellular matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions for a model of cell invasion into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which consists of a non-linear partial differential equation for the density of cells, coupled with an ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing the ECM density. The model contains cross-species density-dependent diffusion and proliferation terms that capture the role of the ECM in providing structural support for the cells during invasion while also preventing growth via volume-filling effects. Furthermore, the model includes ECM degradation by the cells. We present an existence result for weak solutions which is based on carefully exploiting the partial gradient flow structure of the problem which allows us to overcome the non-regularising nature of the ODE involved.
  In addition, we present simulations based on a finite difference scheme that illustrate that the system exhibits travelling wave solutions, and we investigate numerically the asymptotic behaviour as the ECM degradation rate tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural global parameter identifiability indicates whether one can determine a parameter's value in an ODE model from given inputs and outputs. If a given model has parameters for which there is exactly one value, such parameters are called globally identifiable. Given an ODE model involving not globally identifiable parameters, first we transform the system into one with locally identifiable parameters. As a main contribution of this paper, then we present a procedure for replacing, if possible, the ODE model with an equivalent one that has globally identifiable parameters. We first derive this as an algorithm for one-dimensional ODE models and then reuse this approach for higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based method to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>
