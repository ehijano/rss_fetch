      <title>Fluctuation Response Patterns of Network Dynamics -- an Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked dynamical systems, i.e., systems of dynamical units coupled via nontrivial interaction topologies, constitute models of broad classes of complex systems, ranging from gene regulatory and metabolic circuits in our cells to pandemics spreading across continents. Most of such systems are driven by irregular and distributed fluctuating input signals from the environment. Yet how networked dynamical systems collectively respond to such fluctuations depends on the location and type of driving signal, the interaction topology and several other factors and remains largely unknown to date. As a key example, modern electric power grids are undergoing a rapid and systematic transformation towards more sustainable systems, signified by high penetrations of renewable energy sources. These in turn introduce significant fluctuations in power input and thereby pose immediate challenges to the stable operation of power grid systems. How power grid systems dynamically respond to fluctuating power feed-in as well as other temporal changes is critical for ensuring a reliable operation of power grids yet not well understood. In this work, we systematically introduce a linear response theory for fluctuation-driven networked dynamical systems. The derivations presented not only provide approximate analytical descriptions of the dynamical responses of networks, but more importantly, allows to extract key qualitative features about spatio-temporally distributed response patterns. Specifically, we provide a general formulation of a linear response theory for perturbed networked dynamical systems, explicate how dynamic network response patterns arise from the solution of the linearized response dynamics, and emphasize the role of linear response theory in predicting and comprehending power grid responses on different temporal and spatial scales and to various types of disturbances.</description>

      <title>Topological Determinants of Perturbation Spreading in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spreading phenomena essentially underlie the dynamics of various natural and technological networked systems, yet how spatiotemporal propagation patterns emerge from such networks remains largely unknown. Here we propose a novel approach that reveals universal features determining the spreading dynamics in diffusively coupled networks and disentangles them from factors that are system specific. In particular, we first analytically identify a purely topological factor encoding the interaction structure and strength, and second, numerically estimate a master function characterizing the universal scaling of the perturbation arrival times across topologically different networks. The proposed approach thereby provides intuitive insights into complex propagation patterns as well as accurate predictions for the perturbation arrival times. The approach readily generalizes to a wide range of networked systems with diffusive couplings and may contribute to assess the risks of transient influences of ubiquitous perturbations in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulation instability, breathers and solitons in ring-core optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate azimuthal modulation instability in an optical fiber supporting orbital angular momentum modes only, i.e. a vortex fiber, by means of the scalar multimode unidirectional pulse propagation equation. We demonstrate that the nonlinear stage of azimuthal modulation instability taking place in such a ring-core fiber, with anomalous rotation group-velocity dispersion, can be simply described by analytical breather solutions of the corresponding nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Azimuthal soliton dynamics and nonlinear compression are also unveiled as well as specific spatial rotating features as a function of the topological charge involved. Our results open a new route for studying transverse nonlinear waves in optical fibers and for manipulating orbital angular momentum states.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spatial evolution of degenerate quartets of water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we investigate the Benjamin-Feir (or modulation) instability for the spatial evolution of water waves from the perspective of the discrete, spatial Zakharov equation, which captures cubically nonlinear and resonant wave interactions in deep water without restrictions on spectral bandwidth. Spatial evolution, with measurements at discrete locations, is pertinent for laboratory hydrodynamic experiments, such as in wave flumes, which rely on time-series measurements at a series of fixed gauges installed along the facility. This setting is likewise appropriate for experiments in electromagnetic and plasma waves. Through a reformulation of the problem for a degenerate quartet, we bring to bear techniques of phase-plane analysis which elucidate the full dynamics without recourse to linear stability analysis. In particular we find hitherto unexplored breather solutions and discuss the optimal transfer of energy from carrier to sidebands. Finally, we discuss the observability of such discrete solutions in light of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic of frustrated Kuramoto oscillators with modular connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization and collective movement are phenomena of a highly interdisciplinary nature, with examples ranging from neuronal activation to walking pedestrians. As of today, the Kuramoto model stands as the quintessential framework for investigating synchronization phenomena, displaying a second order phase transition from disordered motion to synchronization as the coupling between oscillators increases. The model was recently extended to higher dimensions allowing for the coupling parameter to be promoted to a matrix, leading to generalized frustration and new synchronized states. This model was previously investigated in the case of all-to-all and homogeneous interactions. Here, we extend the analysis to modular graphs, which mimic the community structure presented in many real systems. We investigated, both numerically and analytically, the matrix coupled Kuramoto model with oscillators divided into two groups with distinct coupling parameters to understand in which conditions they synchronize independently or globally. We discovered a very rich and complex dynamic, including an extended region in the parameter space in which the interactions between modules were destructive, leading to a global disordered motion even tough the uncoupled dynamic presented higher levels of synchronization. Additional simulations considering synthetic modular networks were performed to assess the robustness of our findings.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of biological invasion: Open source computational tools, key concepts and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review provides open-access computational tools that support a range of mathematical approaches to analyse three related scalar reaction-diffusion models used to study biological invasion. Starting with the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov (Fisher-KPP) model, we illustrate how computational methods can be used to explore time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in parallel with phase plane and regular perturbation techniques to explore invading travelling wave solutions moving with dimensionless speed $c \ge 2$. To overcome the lack of a well-defined sharp front in solutions of the Fisher-KPP model, we also review two alternative modeling approaches. The first is the Porous-Fisher model where the linear diffusion term is replaced with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion term. Using phase plane and regular perturbation methods, we explore the distinction between sharp- and smooth-fronted invading travelling waves that move with dimensionless speed $c \ge 1/\sqrt{2}$. The second alternative approach is to reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary problem on $0 &lt; x &lt; L(t)$, leading to the Fisher-Stefan model with sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions arising from a PDE model with a linear diffusion term. Time-dependent PDE solutions and phase plane methods show that travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model can describe both biological invasion $(c &gt; 0)$ and biological recession $(c &lt; 0)$. Open source Julia code to replicate all computational results in this review is available on GitHub; we encourage researchers to use this code directly or to adapt the code as required for more complicated models.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Stability Domains of Dark Solitons and Dark Breathers and Drifting Solitons at High Pump Intensities in Normal Dispersion Kerr Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stability domains (i.e. pump frequency detuning range) of a single dark soliton (or platicon) and dark breather in high-Q Kerr optical microresonators with normal group velocity dispersion is studied for a wide range of pump amplitudes within the framework of the Lugiato-Lefever model. The effect of the significant fragmentation of the stability domains at high pump intensities is revealed. The existence of stable drifting dark solitons (platicons) is demonstrated above the threshold pump amplitude value. Properties of drifting solitons are investigated.</description>
