      <title>Discrete differential geometry in homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type families on higher inductive types such as pushouts can capture homotopical properties of differential geometric constructions including connections, curvature, and vector fields. We define a class of pushouts based on simplicial complexes, then define principal bundles, connections, and curvature on these. We provide an example of a tangent bundle but do not prove when these must exist. We define vector fields, and the index of a vector field. Our main result is a theorem relating total curvature and total index, a key step to proving the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem, but without an existing definition of Euler characteristic to compare them to. We draw inspiration in part from the young field of discrete differential geometry, and in part from the original classical proofs, which often make use of triangulations and other discrete arguments.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Relative Categories Model Monoidal $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal $\infty$-categories, as well as its symmetric monoidal version. As an application, we give a concise and complete proof of the fact that every presentably monoidal or presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is presented by a monoidal or symmetric monoidal model category, which, in the monoidal case, was sketched by Lurie, and in the symmetric monoidal case, was proved by Nikolaus--Sagave.</description>

      <title>On DR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A DR-semigroup $S$ (also known as a reduced E-semiabundant or reduced E-Fountain semigroup) is here viewed as a semigroup equipped with two unary operations $D,R$ satisfying finitely many equational laws. Examples include DRC-semigroups (hence Ehresmann semigroups), which also satisfy the congruence conditions. The ample conditions on DR-semigroups are studied here and are defined by the laws $$xD(y)=D(xD(y))x\mbox{ and }R(y)x=xR(R(y)x).$$ Two natural partial orders may be defined on a DR-semigroup and we show that the ample conditions hold if and only if the two orders are equal and the projections (elements of the form $D(x)$) commute with one-another. Restriction semigroups satisfy the generalized ample conditions, but we give other examples using strongly order-preserving functions on a quasiordered set as well as so-called ``double demonic" composition on binary relations. Following the work of Stein, we show how to construct a certain partial algebra $C(S)$ from any DR-semigroup, which is a category if $S$ satisfies the congruence conditions, but is ``almost" a category if the ample conditions hold. We then characterise the ample conditions in terms of a converse of the condition on $S$ ensuring that $C(S)$ is a category. Our main result is an ESN-style theorem for DR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions, based on the $C(S)$ construction. We also obtain an embedding theorem, generalizing a result for restriction semigroups due to Lawson.</description>

      <title>Directories: A Convenient and Well-Behaved Formalism for Hierarchical Organization in Categorical Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an inherently strict presentation of categories with products, coproducts, or symmetric monoidal products that is inspired by file systems and directories. Rather than using nested binary tuples to combine objects or morphisms, the presentation uses named tuples. Specifically, we develop 2-monads whose strict 2-algebras are product categories, coproduct categories, or symmetric monoidal categories, in a similar vein to the classical Fam construction, but where the elements of the indexing set are period-separated identifiers like $\mathtt{cart.motor.momentum}$. Our development of directories is also intended to serve the secondary purpose of expositing certain aspects of polynomial monads, and is accompanied by Haskell code that shows how the mathematical ideas can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Deformations of objects in $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the deformation theory of an object in an $n$-category is controlled by the its $n$-fold endomorphism algebra. This recovers Lurie's results on deforming objects and categories. We also generalize a previous result by Blanc et al. on deforming a category and an object simultaneously to the case of $n$-categories.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>
