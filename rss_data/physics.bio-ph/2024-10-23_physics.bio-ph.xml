      <title>A new angle on the well-known FMO photosynthetic complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a formalism adapted to study transport in quantum open systems, that is the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we revisit the working principle of the most popular photosynthetic complex, namely the Fenna Matthews-Olson complex. We underline the driving force behind the exciton flow. We also show that in a realistic parameter regime, two mechanisms, one of which has not yet been proposed, may be at work to protect the reaction center from overheating.</description>

      <title>Nanothermodynamics: There's plenty of room on the inside</title>

Abstract: Nanothermodynamics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding stable distributions of statistically independent subsystems inside larger systems. In this review it is emphasized that adapting ideas from nanothermodynamics to simplistic models improves agreement with the measured properties of many materials. Examples include non-classical critical scaling near ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass transitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in several models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws: one type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole alignment). This "orthogonal dynamics" explains how the relaxation of a single parameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and microscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the crossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high frequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies. Nanothermodynamics also provides new insight into three basic questions. First, it gives a novel solution to Gibbs' paradox for the entropy of the semi-classical ideal gas. Second, it yields the stable equilibrium of Ising's original model for finite-sized chains of interacting binary degrees of freedom ("spins"). Third, it confronts Loschmidt's paradox for the arrow of time, showing that an intrinsically irreversible step is required for maximum entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, not only in the thermodynamic limit but also in systems as small as N=2 particles</description>

      <title>An evaluation of machine learning/molecular mechanics end-state corrections with mechanical embedding to calculate relative protein-ligand binding free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of machine-learning (ML) potentials offers significant accuracy improvements compared to molecular mechanics (MM) because of the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects in molecular interactions. However, ML simulations are several times more computationally demanding than MM simulations, so there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. One possible compromise are hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) approaches with mechanical embedding that treat the intramolecular interactions of the ligand at the ML level and the protein-ligand interactions at the MM level. Recent studies have reported improved protein-ligand binding free energy results based on ML/MM with mechanical embedding, arguing that intramolecular interactions like torsion potentials of the ligand are often the limiting factor for accuracy. This claim is evaluated based on 108 relative binding free energy calculations for four different benchmark systems. As an alternative strategy, we also tested a tool that fits the MM dihedral potentials to the ML level of theory. Overall, the relative binding free energy results from MM with Open Force Field 2.2.0, MM with ML-fitted torsion potentials, and the corresponding ML/MM end-state corrected simulations show no statistically significant differences in the mean absolute errors (between 0.8 and 0.9 kcal/mol). Therefore, a well-parameterized force field is on a par with simple mechanical embedding ML/MM simulations for protein-ligand binding. In terms of computational costs, the reparametrization of poor torsional potentials is preferable over employing computationally intensive ML/MM simulations of protein-ligand complexes with mechanical embedding. Also, the refitting strategy leads to lower variances of the protein-ligand binding free energy results than the ML/MM end-state corrections.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Relaxometry of Methemoglobin by Widefield Nitrogen-Vacancy Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Hemoglobin (Hb) is a multifaceted protein, classified as a metalloprotein, chromoprotein, and globulin. It incorporates iron, which plays a crucial role in transporting oxygen within red blood cells. Hb functions by carrying oxygen from the respiratory organs to diverse tissues in the body, where it releases oxygen to fuel aerobic respiration, thus supporting the organism's metabolic processes. Hb can exist in several forms, primarily distinguished by the oxidation state of the iron in the heme group, including Methemoglobin (MetHb). Measuring the concentration of MetHb is crucial because it cannot transport oxygen, hence higher concentration of MetHb in the blood causes methemoglobinemia. Here, we use optically detected magnetic relaxometry of paramagnetic iron spins in MetHb drop-casted onto nanostructured diamond doped with shallow high density nitrogen vacancy (NV) spin qubits. We modify the MetHb concentration in the range of 6 x 10^6 - 1.8 x 10^7 adsorbed Fe+3 spins per um^2 and observe an increase of the NV relaxation rate G1 (= 1/T1, T1 is NV spin lattice relaxation time) up to 2 x 10^3 s^-1. NV magnetic relaxometry of MetHb in phosphate-buffered saline solution shows a similar effect with an increase of G1 to 6.7 x 10e3 s^-1 upon increasing the MetHb concentration to 100 uM. The increase of NV G1 is explained by the increased spin noise coming from the Fe+3 spins present in MetHb proteins. This study presents an additional usage of NV quantum sensors to detect paramagnetic centers of biomolecules at volumes below 100 picoliter.</description>

      <title>Peptide Classification from Statistical Analysis of Nanopore Translocation Experiments</title>

Abstract: Protein characterization using nanopore-based devices promises to be a breakthrough method in basic research, diagnostics, and analytics. Current research includes the use of machine learning to achieve this task. In this work, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is performed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides with over 70 % accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the catch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training small classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the events, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key in classifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results highlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and suggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.</description>

      <title>An integrated evanescent-field biosensor in silicon</title>

Abstract: Decentralized diagnostic testing that is accurate, portable, quantitative, and capable of making multiple simultaneous measurements of different biomarkers at the point-of-need remains an important unmet need in the post-pandemic world. Resonator-based biosensors using silicon photonic integrated circuits are a promising technology to meet this need, as they can leverage (1) semiconductor manufacturing economies of scale, (2) exquisite optical sensitivity, and (3) the ability to integrate tens to hundreds of sensors on a millimeter-scale photonic chip. However, their application to decentralized testing has historically been limited by the expensive, bulky tunable lasers and alignment optics required for their readout. In this work, we introduce a segmented sensor architecture that addresses this important challenge by facilitating resonance-tracking readout using a fixed-wavelength laser. The architecture incorporates an in-resonator phase shifter modulated by CMOS drivers to periodically sweep and acquire the resonance peak shifts as well as a distinct high-sensitivity sensing region, maintaining high performance at a fraction of the cost and size. We show, for the first time, that fixed-wavelength sensor readout can offer similar performance to traditional tunable laser readout, demonstrating a system limit of detection of 6.1 x 10-5 RIU as well as immunoassay-based detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We anticipate that this sensor architecture will open the door to a new data-rich class of portable, accurate, multiplexed diagnostics for decentralized testing.</description>
