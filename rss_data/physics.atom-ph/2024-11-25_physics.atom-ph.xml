      <title>A distorted-wave approach to the elastic scattering of twisted electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic scattering of spinless vortex electrons on realistic target atoms has been investigated. In particular, expressions are derived in different approximations for the elastic angular-differential cross sections. We develop a distorted wave formalism that includes the effect of the atomic potential on the impinging vortex electron and compare this to a plane-wave Born approximation without such a distortion. Detailed computations have been performed for elastic scattering of vortex electrons on helium, neon, and argon targets by varying the energy, topological charge, and opening angle. Our results show that the overall magnitude of the cross section increases when the distortion by the bound-state electrons is taken into account. We also show that under certain conditions, such as high-Z targets or projectiles with low values of topological charge, significant differences in cross section shape and magnitude are observed between the distorted-wave and plane-wave Born models. Thus, the plane-wave Born approximation must be used with caution when describing vortex electron collisions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Non-Exponential Auger-Meitner Decay of Inner-Shell-Excited CO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronically excited atoms or molecules may deexcite by emission of a secondary electron through an Auger-Meitner decay. This deexcitation process is typically considered to be exponential in time. This is strictly speaking, however, only true for the case of an atom. Here, we present a study experimentally demonstrating the non-exponential time dependence of the decay of an inner-shell hole in a diatomic molecule. In addition, we provide an intuitive explanation for the origin of the observed variation of the molecular lifetimes and their dependence on the kinetic energy of the ionic fragments measured in coincidence with the photoelectrons.</description>

      <title>Spin structure of diatomic van der Waal molecules of alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14787v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules formed by two identical bosonic alkali atoms. Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter, which is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.</description>

      <title>Tunable Two-Species Spin Models with Rydberg Atoms in Circular and Elliptical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <title>High-dynamic-range atomic clocks with dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a maximally multiparticle entangled state capable of reaching the fundamental precision limit in quantum sensing. While GHZ-state-based atomic clocks hold the potential to achieve Heisenberg-limited precision [Nature 634, 315 (2024); Nature 634, 321 (2024)], they suffer from a reduced dynamic range. Here we demonstrate how Bayesian quantum estimation can be utilized to extend the dynamic range of GHZ-state-based atomic clocks while maintaining precision close to the Heisenberg limit. In the framework of Bayesian quantum estimation, we design a sequence of correlated Ramsey interferometry for atomic clocks utilizing individual and cascaded GHZ states.In this sequence, the interrogation time is updated based on the credible intervals of the posterior distribution.By combining an interferometry sequence with short and long interrogation times, our scheme overcomes the trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range in GHZ-state-based atomic clocks and offers an alternative approach for extending dynamic range while maintaining high sensitivity. Notably our approach enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling with respect to both particle number and total interrogation time. In addition to atomic clocks, our study offers a promising avenue for developing high-dynamic-range entanglement-enhanced interferometry-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Absolute frequency measurements on the $5s5p^{3}$P$_{0}\to5s6d^{3}$D$_{1}$ transition in strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first absolute frequency measurements for the $5s5p^{3}$P$_{0}\to5s6d^{3}$D$_{1}$ transition at 394 nm for all the stable strontium isotopes by utilizing repumping induced spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. Absolute transition frequency is measured to be 760524409251(25) kHz for $^{88}$Sr.With reference to $^{88}$Sr, the isotope shifts are measured to be 91052(35), 54600(33), and 51641(28) kHz for $^{84}$Sr, $^{86}$Sr, and $^{87}$Sr, respectively. We calculate the hyperfine constants A and B for the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr at kHz level. Furthermore, we perform King plot analysis by combining isotope shifts on the 689-nm transition to our data.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>
