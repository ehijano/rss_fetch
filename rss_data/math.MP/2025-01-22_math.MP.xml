      <title>Vortices for lake equations (review with questions and speculations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `lake equation' on a planar domain $D$ with bathymetry $b(x,y)$ is given by $ \partial_t u + (u \cdot {\rm grad}) u= -{\rm grad}\, p \,, \,\,{\rm div} (b u) = 0 \,,\, \text{with}\,\, u \parallel \partial D.$ % \, \,\, \,\,\, \text{),}$$ We focus on Geometric Mechanics aspects, glossing over hard analysis issues. % related to the desingularization. Motivating example is a `rip current' produced by vortex pairs near a beach shore. For uniform slope beach there is a perfect analogy with \ Thomson's vortex rings. The stream function produced by a vortex is defined as the Green function of the operator $- {\rm div} ( {\rm grad} \psi/b)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. As in elasticity, the lake equations give rise to pseudoanalytical functions and quasiconformal mappings. Uniformly elliptic equations on closed Riemann surfaces could be called `planet equations'.</description>

      <title>Sesquilinear forms as eigenvectors in quasi *-algebras, with an application to ladder elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of sesquilinear forms on a {Banach quasi *-algebra} $(\A[\|.\|],\Ao[\|.\|_0])$ which we call {\em eigenstates of an element} $a\in\A$, and we deduce some of their properties. We further apply our definition to a family of ladder elements, i.e. elements of $\A$ obeying certain commutation relations physically motivated, and we discuss several results, including orthogonality and biorthogonality of the forms, via GNS-representation.</description>

      <title>Two-sided bounds on the point-wise spatial decay of ground states in the renormalized Nelson model with confining potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalized Nelson model for a scalar matter particle in a continuous confining potential interacting with a possibly massless quantized radiation field. When the radiation field is massless we impose a mild infrared regularization ensuring that the Nelson Hamiltonian has a non-degenerate ground state in all considered cases. Employing Feynman-Kac representations, we derive lower bounds on the point-wise spatial decay of the partial Fock space norms of ground state eigenvectors. Here the exponential rate function governing the decay is given by the Agmon distance familiar from the analysis of Schr\"{o}dinger operators. For a large class of confining potentials, our lower bounds on the decay of ground state eigenvectors match asymptotically with the upper bounds implied by previous work of the present authors.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to WKB-methods: The eigenvalue problem for a single well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the eigenvalue problem of the one-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation for smooth single well potentials. In particular, we provide a new interpretation of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula. A novel aspect of our results, which are based on recent work of the authors on the turning point problem based upon dynamical systems methods, is that we cover all eigenvalues $E\in [0,\mathcal O(1)]$ and show that the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantitization formula approximates all of these eigenvalues (in a sense that is made precise). At the same time, we provide rigorous smoothness statements of the eigenvalues as functions of $\epsilon$. We find that whereas the small eigenvalues $E=\mathcal O(\epsilon)$ are smooth functions of $\epsilon$, the large ones $E=\mathcal O(1)$ are smooth functions of $n\epsilon \in[c_1,c_2],\,0&lt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;\infty$, and $0\le \epsilon^{1/3}\ll 1$; here $n\in \mathbb N_0$ is the index of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Localization of the massive scalar boson on achronal hyperplanes, derivation of Lorentz contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the causal localizations of the massive scalar boson on spacelike hyperplanes extend uniquely to all achronal hyperplanes. The extension occurs by means of the high boost limit. It is still covariant. Towards a localization in maximal achronal locally flat surfaces a simple but emblematic case shows that normalization is preserved. The existence of the high boost limit is closely related to the phenomenon of Lorentz contraction, which is discussed to some extent. In conclusion, these considerations constitute a clear plea for the concept of acronal localization [4].</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconnection processes of 3-solitons with 2-resonance can produce distinct local structures that initially connect two pairs of V-shaped branches, then disappear, and later re-emerge as new forms. We call such local structures as stem structures. In this paper, we investigate the variable-length stem structures during the soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system. We consider two scenarios: weak 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=0,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$) and strong 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=+\infty,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$). We determine the asymptotic forms of the four arms and their corresponding stem structures using two-variable asymptotic analysis method which is involved simultaneously with one space variable $y$ (or $x$) and one temporal variable $t$. Different from known studies, our findings reveal that the asymptotic forms of the arms $S_2$ and $S_3$ differ by a phase shift as $t\to\pm\infty$. Building on these asymptotic forms, we perform a detailed analysis of the trajectories, amplitudes, and velocities of the soliton arms and stem structures. Subsequently, we discuss the localization of the stem structures, focusing on their endpoints, lengths, and extreme points in both weak and strong 2-resonance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Density matrices and entropy operator for non-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider density matrices operator related to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In particular, we analyse two natural extensions of what is usually called a density matrix operator (DM), of pure states and of the entropy operator: we first consider those {\em operators} which are simply similar to a standard DM, and then we discuss those which are intertwined with a DM by a third, non invertible, operator, giving rise to waht we call Riesz Density Matrix operator (RDM). After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of $PT$-quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries II. Coulomb Gas Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <title>Geometric Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for integer Quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for an integer Quantum Hall state. Given an effective reduced divisor on a compact connected Riemann surface, using the canonical holomorphic section of the associated canonical line bundle as well as certain initial data and local normalisation data, we construct a canonical non-zero element in the determinant line of the cohomology of the $p$-tensor power of the line bundle.
  When endowed with proper metric data, the square of the $ L^{2} $-norm of our canonical element is the partition function associated to an integer Quantum Hall state. We establish an asymptotic expansion for the logarithm of the partition function when $ p\to +\infty$. The constant term of this expansion includes the holomorphic analytic torsion and matches a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann's prediction.
  Our proof relies on Bismut-Lebeau's embedding formula for the Quillen metrics, Bismut-Vasserot and Finski's asymptotic expansion for the analytic torsion associated to the higher tensor product of a positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundle.</description>

      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a "homotopification" of fundamental concepts from information theory. Using homotopy type theory, we define homotopy types that behave analogously to probability spaces, random variables, and the exponentials of Shannon entropy and relative entropy. The original analytic theories emerge through homotopy cardinality, which maps homotopy types to real numbers and generalizes the cardinality of sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on quantum graphs with an attractive potential supported in the compact core, and investigate the existence and the nonexistence of Ground States, defined as minimizers of the energy at fixed $L^2$-norm, or mass. We finally reach the following picture: for small and large mass there are Ground States. Moreover, according to the metric features of the compact core of the graph and to the strength of the potential, there may be a region of intermediate masses for which there are no Ground States. The study was originally inspired by the research on quantum waveguides, in which the curvature of a thin tube induces an effective attractive potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-dimensional first-order theory for functionally graded elastic beams using the variational-asymptotic method. This approach ensures an asymptotically exact one-dimensional equations, allowing for the precise determination of effective stiffnesses in extension, bending, and torsion via numerical solutions of the dual variational problems on the cross-section. Our theory distinguishes itself by offering a rigorous error estimation based on the Prager-Synge identity, which highlights the limits of accuracy and applicability of the derived one-dimensional model for beams with continuously varying elastic moduli across the cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the Dirac equation on the cosmic string background, which models a one--dimensional topological defect in the spacetime. We first define the Dirac operator in this setting, classifying all of its selfadjoint extensions, and we give an explicit kernel for the propagator. Secondly, we prove dispersive estimates for the flow, with and without weights. Finally, we prove Strichartz estimates for the flow in a sharp restricted set of indices, which are different from the classical Euclidean ones.</description>

      <title>Quasiconvex relaxation of planar Biot-type energies and the role of determinant constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the quasiconvex relaxation of the Biot-type energy density $\lVert\sqrt{\operatorname{D}\varphi^T \operatorname{D}\varphi}-I_2\rVert^2$ for planar mappings $\varphi\colon\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ in two different scenarios. First, we consider the case $\operatorname{D}\varphi\in\textrm{GL}^+(2)$, in which the energy can be expressed as the squared Euclidean distance $\operatorname{dist}^2(\operatorname{D}\varphi,\textrm{SO}(2))$ to the special orthogonal group $\textrm{SO}(2)$. We then allow for planar mappings with arbitrary $\operatorname{D}\varphi\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$; in the context of solid mechanics, this lack of determinant constraints on the deformation gradient would allow for self-interpenetration of matter. We demonstrate that the two resulting relaxations do not coincide and compare the analytical findings to numerical results for different relaxation approaches, including a rank-one sequential lamination algorithm, trust-region FEM calculations of representative microstructures and physics-informed neural networks.</description>

      <title>The stochastic porous medium equation in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We predict the values of the two growth exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the functional RG. Extensive numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional "local" exponent $\alpha_{\rm loc}$, as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel process. This model allows for several predictions about the multiscaling properties.</description>

      <title>Entropy and singular-value moments of products of truncated random unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Products of truncated unitary matrices, independently and uniformly drawn from the unitary group, can be used to study universal aspects of monitored quantum circuits. The von Neumann entropy of the corresponding density matrix decreases with increasing length $L$ of the product chain, in a way that depends on the matrix dimension $N$ and the truncation depth $\delta N$. Here we study that dependence in the double-scaling limit $L,N\rightarrow\infty$, at fixed ratio $\tau=L\delta N/N$. The entropy reduction crosses over from a linear to a logarithmic dependence on $\tau$ when this parameter crosses unity. The central technical result is an expression for the singular-value moments of the matrix product in terms of the Erlang function from queueing theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical aspects of Quantum theory and under which description Quantum theory does appear Classical. Although such descriptions or variables are known as "ontological" or "hidden", they are not hidden at all, but are dual classical states (in the sense of the general classical-quantum duality of Nature). The application of the Minimal Group Representation immediately classicalizes the system, Mp(2) emerging as the group of the classical-quantum duality symmetry. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Kantowski--Sachs Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent Kantowski--Sachs spherically symmetric teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity with a scalar field source. We begin by setting the exact field equations to be solved and solve conservation laws for possible scalar field potential, $V\left(\phi\right)$, solutions. Then, we find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions by using power-law and exponential ansatz for each potential case arising from conservation laws, such as linear, quadratic, or logarithmic, to name a few. We find a general formula allowing us to compute all possible new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions applicable for any scalar field potential and ansatz. Then, we apply this formula and find a large number of exact and approximate new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for several types of cases. Some new $F(T)$ solution classes may be relevant for future cosmological applications, especially concerning dark matter, dark energy quintessence, phantom energy leading to the Big Rip event, and quintom models of physical processes.</description>

      <title>Bulk-edge correspondence in circular-symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for unique codings of fat Sierpinski gasket with multiple digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $M\ge 1$ and $\beta\in(1, M+1)$, let $S_{\beta, M}$ be the fat Sierpinski gasket in $\mathbb R^2$ generated by the iterated function system $\left\{f_d(x)=\frac{x+d}{\beta}: d\in\Omega_M\right\}$, where $\Omega_M=\{(i,j)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^2: i+j\le M\}$. Then each $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ may represent as a series $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{\beta^i}=:\Pi_\beta((d_i))$, and the infinite sequence $(d_i)\in\Omega_M^{\mathbb N}$ is called a \emph{coding} of $x$. Since $\beta&lt;M+1$, a point in $S_{\beta, M}$ may have multiple codings. Let $U_{\beta, M}$ be the set of $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ having a unique coding, that is \[ U_{\beta, M}=\left\{x\in S_{\beta, M}: \#\Pi_\beta^{-1}(x)=1\right\}. \] When $M=1$, Kong and Li [2020, Nonlinearity] described two critical bases for the phase transitions of the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde U_{\beta, 1}$, which is a subset of $U_{\beta, 1}$. In this paper we consider $M\ge 2$, and characterize the two critical bases $\beta_G(M)$ and $\beta_c(M)$ for the phase transitions of $U_{\beta, M}$: (i) if $\beta\in(1, \beta_G(M)]$, then $U_{\beta, M}$ is finite; (ii) if $\beta\in(\beta_G(M), \beta_c(M))$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is countably infinite; (iii) if $\beta=\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is uncountable and has zero Hausdorff dimension; (iv) if $\beta&gt;\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our results can also be applied to the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde{U}_{\beta, M}$. Moreover, we show that the first critical base $\beta_G(M)$ is a perron number, while the second critical base $\beta_c(M)$ is a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in quasi-resonant solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the phase shift of X-shaped solutions before and after interaction is finite but approaches infinity, the vertices of the two V-shaped structures become separated due to the phase shift and are connected by a localized structure. This special type of elastic collision is known as a quasi-resonant collision, and the localized structure is referred to as the stem structure. This study investigates quasi-resonant solutions and the associated localized stem structures in the context of the KPII and KPI equations. For the KPII equation, we classify quasi-resonant 2-solitons into weakly and strongly types, depending on whether the parameter \(a_{12} \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\). We analyze their asymptotic forms to detail the trajectories, amplitudes, velocities, and lengths of their stem structures. These results of quasi-resonant 2-solitons are used to to provide analytical descriptions of interesting patterns of the water waves observed on Venice Beach. Similarly, for the KPI equation, we construct quasi-resonant breather-soliton solutions and classify them into weakly and strongly types, based on whether the parameters \(\alpha_1^2 + \beta_1^2 \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\) (equivalent to \(a_{13} \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\)). We compare the similarities and differences between the stem structures in the quasi-resonant soliton and the quasi-resonant breather-soliton. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their asymptotic forms and stem structures. Our results indicate that the resonant solution, i.e. resonant breather-soliton of the KPI and soliton for the KPII, represents the limiting case of the quasi-resonant solution as \(\epsilon \to 0\).</description>

      <title>Inverse Stefan problems of determining the time-dependent source coefficient and heat flux function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the Inverse Stefan problem, specifically focusing on determining the time-dependent source coefficient in the parabolic heat equation governing heat transfer in a semi-infinite rod. The problem entails the intricate task of uncovering both temperature- and time-dependent coefficients of the source while accommodating Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Through a comprehensive mathematical model and rigorous theoretical analysis, our study aims to provide a robust methodology for accurately determining the source coefficient from observed temperature and heat flux data in problems with different cases of the source functions. Importantly, we establish the existence and uniqueness, and estimate the continuous dependence of a weak solution upon the given data for some inverse problems, offering a foundational understanding of its solvability.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Responses of Generalized Landau Levels: Structure Factor and the Quantized Hall Viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal K\"ahler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) in Minkowski spacetime, we study the spacetime distance between two events along two distinct modular trajectories. When the spatial line is bipartite by a single interval, we consider both the ground state and the state at finite different temperatures for the left and right moving excitations. For the free massless Dirac field in the ground state, the bipartition of the line given by the union of two disjoint intervals is also investigated. The modular flows corresponding to connected subsystems preserve relativistic causality. Locality along the modular flows of some fields is explored by evaluating their (anti-)commutators. In particular, the bilocal nature of the modular Hamiltonian of two disjoint intervals for the massless Dirac field provide multiple trajectories leading to Dirac delta contributions in the (anti-)commutators even when the initial points belong to different intervals, thus being spacelike separated.</description>

Abstract: We present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on the diverse interpretations of the channel. Also, we extended them to higher-dimensional qudit systems, formulating different versions of dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we showed the inequivalence of these versions as they affect in very distinct ways the states entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the multi-species Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model at its conjectured critical temperature, and we show that, when the variance profile matrix $\Delta^2$ is positive semi-definite, the variance of the free energy is $O(\log^2N)$. Furthermore, when one approaches this temperature threshold from the low temperature side at a rate of $O(N^{-\alpha})$ with $\alpha&gt;0$, the variance is $O(\log^2N+N^{1-\alpha})$. This result is a direct extension of the work of Chen and Lam (2019) who proved an analogous result for the SK model, and our proof methods are adapted from theirs.</description>

Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity, which has two versions: one in which the energy-momentum conservation is assumed a priori and another in which it is not. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. The first action is based on the metric, while the second action is based on the tetrad and connection where the conservation of the energy-momentum holds if torsion vanishes. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity, which has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. In this paper, we report two fully diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model plus an interaction term involving the fields that impose the constraints on the $B$ fields. The second action employs two copies of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint. Both actions use complex variables, and naturally include one of the reality conditions imposed in the Plebanski formulation of general relativity. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector is trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs and Yang-Baxter operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ferri and Sciandra introduced two equivalent algebraic structures, matched pair of actions on an arbitrary Hopf algebra and Yetter-Drinfeld brace. In fact, they equivalently produce braiding operators satisfying the braid equation, thus generalize the construction of Yang-Baxter operators by Lu, Yan and Zhu from braiding operators on groups, and also by Angiono, Galindo and Vendramin from cocommutative Hopf braces. In this paper, we provide equivalence conditions for such kind of Yang-Baxter operators to be involutive. Particularly, we give a positive answer for an open problem raised by Ferri and Sciandra, namely, a matched pair of actions on a Hopf algebra $H$ induces an involutive Yang-Baxter operator if and only if its intrinsic Hopf algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ is braided commutative. As an illustration, we use a simplified characterization to classify matched pairs of actions on the 8-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf algebra $A_{C_2\times C_2}$ and analyze the associated Yang-Baxter operators to find that they are all involutive.</description>

Abstract: By using characteristic cycles, we build a morphism from the canonical bases of integrable highest weight modules of quantum groups to the top Borel-Moore homology groups of Nakajima's quiver and tensor product varieties, and compare the canonical bases and the fundamental classes. As an application, we show that Nakajima's realization of irreducible highest weight modules and their tensor products can be defined over integers. We also prove Nakajima's conjecture on the canonical isomorphism of tensor product varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12105v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study doubly degenerate (Juddian) eigenvalues for the Quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, a simple model of the interaction between a two-level atom and a single quantized mode of light. We prove a strong form of the density conjecture of Kimoto, Reyes-Bustos, and Wakayama, showing that any fixed value of the splitting between the two atomic levels, there is a dense set of coupling strengths for which the corresponding Rabi Hamiltonian admits Juddian eigenvalues. We also construct infinitely many sets of parameters for which the Rabi Hamiltonian admits two distinct Juddian eigenvalues. The fine structure of the zeros of classical Laguerre polynomials plays a key role in our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop tools to study arithmetically induced singular continuous spectrum in the neighborhood of the arithmetic transition in the hyperbolic regime. This leads to first transition-capturing upper bounds on packing and multifractal dimensions of spectral measures. We achieve it through the proof of partial localization of generalized eigenfunctions, another first result of its kind in the singular continuous regime. The proof is based also on a general criterion for lower bounds on concentrations of Borel measures as a corollary of boundary behavior of their Borel-type transforms, that may be of wider use and independent interest.</description>

      <title>A quadratic BSDE approach to normalization for the finite volume 2D sine-Gordon model in the finite ultraviolet regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a new construction of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model on bounded domains by a novel normalization technique in the finite ultraviolet regime. Our methodology involves a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs for short) driven by a cylindrical Wiener process, whose generators are purely quadratic functions of the second unknown variable. The terminal conditions of the quadratic BSDEs are uniformly bounded and converge in probability to the real part of imaginary multiplicative chaos tested against an arbitrarily given test function, which helps us describe our sine-Gordon measure through some delicate estimates concerning bounded mean oscillation martingales. As the ultraviolet cutoffs are vanishing, the quadratic BSDEs converge to a quadratic BSDE that completely characterizes the absolute continuity of our sine-Gordon measure with respect to the law of Gaussian free fields. Our approach can also be used effectively to establish the connection between our sine-Gordon measure and the scaling limit of correlation functions of the critical planar XOR-Ising model and to prove the weak convergence of the normalized charge distributions of two-dimensional log-gases.</description>

Abstract: We construct and study the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) representations naturally associated to the Fourier transform of finite abelian groups $G$. We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD-positive states are convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied. We provide examples of abelian groups where it is not. In those cases, the convex set of KD-positive states contains states outside the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states.</description>

Abstract: We cast the non--isentropic relativistic Euler system into a symmetric hyperbolic form. Such systems are very suited to treat initial value problems of hyperbolic type. We obtain this form by using the pressure $p$ and not the density $\rho$ as a variable. However, the system becomes degenerate when the pressure $p$ approaches zero, and in these cases we regularise the system by replacing the pressure with an appropriate new matter variable, the Makino variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Integrated Density of States (IDS) of the random Schr\"odinger operator appearing in the study of certain reinforced random processes in connection with a supersymmetric sigma-model. We rely on previous results on the supersymmetric sigma-model to obtain lower and upper bounds on the asymptotic behavior of the IDS near the bottom of the spectrum in all dimension. We show a phase transition for the IDS between weak and strong disorder regime in dimension larger or equal to three, that follows from a phase transition in the corresponding random process and supersymmetric sigma-model. In particular, we show that the IDS does not exhibit Lifshitz tails in the strong disorder regime, confirming a recent conjecture. This is in stark contrast with other disordered systems, like the Anderson model. A Wegner type estimate is also derived, giving an upper bound on the IDS and showing the regularity of the function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of Hamiltonians of $XXZ$ spin chains in a uniform external magnetic field that are small quantum perturbations of an Ising Hamiltonian, it is shown that the spectral gap above the ground-state energy remains strictly positive when the perturbation is turned on, uniformly in the length of the chain. This result is proven for perturbations of both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic Ising Hamiltonian. In the antiferromagnetic case, the external magnetic field is required to be small. For a chain of an even number of sites, the two-fold degenerate ground-state energy of the unperturbed antiferromagnetic Hamiltonian may split into two energy levels separated by a very small gap. These results are proven by using a new, quite subtle refinement of a method developed in earlier work and used to iteratively block-diagonalize Hamiltonians of systems confined to ever larger subsets of a lattice by using strictly local unitary conjugations. The new method developed in this paper provides complete control of boundary effects on the low-energy spectrum of perturbed Ising chains uniformly in their length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a surface which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary conditions. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models. We wish to study the geometry of $d$-dimensional minimal surfaces in a $(d+n)$-dimensional random environment. Specializing to a model that we term harmonic MSRE, in an ``independent'' random environment, we rigorously establish bounds on the geometric and energetic fluctuations of the minimal surface, as well as versions of the scaling relation $\chi=2\xi+d-2$ that ties together these two types of fluctuations. In particular, we prove, for all values of $n$, that the surfaces are delocalized in dimensions $d\le 4$ and localized in dimensions $d\ge 5$. Moreover, the surface delocalizes with power-law fluctuations when $d\le 3$ and sub-power-law fluctuations when $d=4$. Our localization results apply also to harmonic minimal surfaces in a periodic random environment.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian formalism for general variational problems, with applications to first order gravity with basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article introduces a generalization of the (multisymplectic) Hamiltonian field theory for a Lagrangian density, allowing the formulation of this kind of field theories for variational problem of more general nature than those associated to a classical variational problem. It is achieved by realizing that the usual construction of the Hamiltonian equations can be performed without the use of the so called Hamiltonian section, whose existence is problematic when general variational problems are considered. The developed formalism is applied to obtain a novel multisymplectic Hamiltonian field theory for a first order formulation of gravity with basis in the full frame bundle. Also, aspects of a constraint algorithm in this generalized setting are discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain (generally dissipative) mechanical systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by making use of the formalism of Jacobi last multipliers.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of trapped two-dimensional Bose gases with mean-field type interactions that can be attractive. We prove the stability of second kind of the many-body system and the convergence of the ground state energy per particle to that of a non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) energy functional. Notably, we can take any polynomial scaling of the interaction, and even some exponential scaling, which is a drastic improvement on the best-known result for systems with attractive interactions. As a consequence of the stability of second kind we also obtain Bose-Einstein condensation for the many-body ground states for a much improved range of the diluteness parameter.</description>

Abstract: We present some addition theorems for spin-weighted spherical harmonics, generalizing previous results for scalar (spin-zero) spherical harmonics. These addition theorems involve sums over the azimuthal quantum number of products of two spin-weighted spherical harmonics at different points on the two-sphere, either (or both) of which are differentiated with respect to one of their arguments.</description>

Abstract: We consider periodic (pseudo)differential {elliptic operators of Schr\"odinger type} perturbed by weak magnetic fields not vanishing at infinity, and extend our previous analysis in \cite{CIP,CHP-2,CHP-4} to the case {of a semimetal having a finite family of Bloch eigenvalues whose range may overlap with the other Bloch bands but remains isolated at each fixed quasi-momentum.} We do not make any assumption of triviality for the associated Bloch bundle. In this setting, we formulate a general form of the Peierls-Onsager substitution {via strongly localized tight-frames and magnetic matrices. We also} prove the existence of an approximate time evolution for initial states supported inside the range of the isolated Bloch family, with a precise error control.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. Such highest weight vectors arise as partition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the representations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators $ \omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion'' formula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectral curve with $ \hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction, starting from an $\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied. When this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the shifted topological recursion obtained earlier.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study the large-time asymptotics of the solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation under a symmetric non-vanishing background, which supports the emergence of solitons. It is demonstrated that the asymptotic expansion of the solution at the large time could verify the renowned soliton resolution conjecture. Moreover, the asymptotic stability of $N$-soliton solution is also exhibited in the present work. We establish our results by performing a $\bar{\partial}$-nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a shattered phase within the replica-symmetric phase of the pure spherical $p$-spin models for $p$ sufficiently large.
  In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass.
  We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.</description>

      <title>On the Emergent "Quantum" Theory in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schr\"odinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We analyze geometric aspects of the gradient descent algorithm in Deep Learning (DL), and give a detailed discussion of the circumstance that in underparametrized DL networks, zero loss minimization can generically not be attained. As a consequence, we conclude that the distribution of training inputs must necessarily be non-generic in order to produce zero loss minimizers, both for the method constructed in [Chen-Munoz Ewald 2023, 2024], or for gradient descent [Chen 2025] (which assume clustering of training data).</description>

Abstract: We develop a qualitative homogenisation and spectral theory for elliptic systems of partial differential equations in divergence form with highly contrasting (i.e., non uniformly elliptic) random coefficients. The focus of the paper is on the behaviour of the spectrum as the heterogeneity parameter tends to zero; in particular, we show that in general one doesn't have Hausdorff convergence of spectra. The theoretical analysis is complemented by several explicit examples, showcasing the wider range of applications and physical effects of systems with random coefficients, when compared with systems with periodic coefficients or with scalar operators (both random and periodic).</description>

      <title>Decomposition of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k} \ \oplus \ {\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$ highest weight representations for generic level $k$ and equivalence between two dimensional CFT models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct highest weight vectors of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$ in tensor products of highest weight modules of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$ and ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$, and thus for generic weights we find the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$. The construction uses Wakimoto representations of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$, but the obtained vectors can be mapped back to Verma modules. Singularities of this mapping are cancelled by a renormalization. A detailed study of ``degenerations'' of Wakimoto modules allowed to find the renormalization factor explicitly. The obtained result is a significant step forward in a proof of equivalence of certain two-dimesnional CFT models.</description>

      <title>On the simulation of quantum multimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as otherwise we could create any resource from nothing. For example, the set of transformations includes maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. From the perspective of an experimenter with a given multimeter as part of a complicated setup, having to discard the multimeter and using a different one instead is undesirable. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of homomorphisms among unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. This adjusted von Neumann entropy is the negative of the relative entropy with respect to the uniform state on the C*-algebra, up to an additive constant. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of $2d$ sigma models which are parameterized by a function of one variable. In addition to the physical field $g$, these models include an auxiliary field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every theory in this family is classically integrable, in that it possesses an infinite set of conserved charges in involution, which can be constructed from a Lax representation for the equations of motion. This class includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum systems with energy constraints relative to a reference Hamiltonian. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. We observe new submultiplicativity inequalities for the energy-constrained diamond and operator norms and use them to derive new state-dependent continuity bounds for quantum speed limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined unramified Gromov-Witten invariants. For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Approximating exponentials of commutators by optimized product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotter product formulas constitute a cornerstone quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. However, the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian evolution of nested commutators remains an under explored area. In this work, we construct optimized product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Polymorphisms in Non-Commutative Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress on the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in a periodic setting, which describes the random growth of an interface in a cylindrical geometry. The main results include central limit theorems for the height of the interface and the winding number of the directed polymer in a periodic random environment. We present two different approaches for each result, utilizing either a homogenization argument or tools from Malliavin calculus. A surprising finding in the case of a $1+1$ spacetime white noise is that the effective variances for both the height and the winding number can be expressed in terms of independent Brownian bridges.
  Additionally, we present two new results: (i) the explicit expression of the corrector used in the homogenization argument, and (ii) the law of the iterated logarithm for the height function.</description>

Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM), derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas. The closed form of this model is presented by introducing a set new functions called $R$ function and $R$ integration. This nonlinear model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, enables the capture of the nature of the equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry, and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all modular invariant representations of the Kac--Moody algebras. For the Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ the string functions of admissible representations are allowed to have certain rational levels and were realized by Ahn, Chung, and Tye as the characters of the generalized Fateev--Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. For the $1/2$-level string functions, we present their mixed mock modular properties as well as elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities involving two mock theta functions from Ramanujan's Lost Notebook. In addition, we demonstrate that the negative level string functions can be evaluated in terms of false theta functions.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>Backreacted Coulomb energy in the Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Skyrme model is extended with the Maxwell action and a source term for the gauge field. We consider the specialized case of vanishing isospin states, such that only an electric potential is turned on and study the backreaction onto the Skyrme fields. In particular, we study Skyrmions with baryon numbers B=4,8,12,16 and 40. We find, in agreement with physical expectations, that the Coulomb backreaction is most pronounced for large Skyrmions and find furthermore that the dynamics of the theory is more sensitive to the backreaction than the ground states (global minimizers of the energy). Calibrating the model to Carbon-12, we find excellent agreement of the masses of the studied Skyrmions - within 1.86% of experimental data. The Coulomb energies are slightly larger than phenomenological fits suggest, but only by about 3-22%, whereas the radii are within 15% errors, with the largest errors on the smallest baryon number (B=4) and the smallest errors on the large baryon numbers.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. Therefore, a Riemann weak shock is rigid (not turbulent) under physical disturbances. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the (unconditional) stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters.</description>

      <title>Locally Interacting Lattice Bosons: Clustering Theorem, Low-Density Condition and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistical and quantum many-body physics, the correlation function is a fundamental quantity, especially for lattice models described by local Hamiltonians. Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function typically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation concentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long distances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin and fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a long-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite Hilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension of a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson counterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing primarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously justify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the Bose-Hubbard type. This assumption is often invoked as a preliminary requirement for proving various rigorous results, including the boson Lieb-Robinson bound. Building on the results above, we show that, at high temperature, the specific heat density can be bounded from above by a constant, and the boson thermal area law holds true. Our achievement is based on the imaginary-time interaction picture, which is expected to have much broader applications to other open problems concerning bosons in statistical and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions in teleparallel $F(T,B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find several teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for a Robertson--Walker (TRW) cosmological spacetime. We first set and solve the $F(T,B)$-type field equations for a linear perfect fluid. Using similar techniques, we then find new $F(T,B)$ solutions for non-linear perfect fluids with a weak quadratic correction term to the linear equation of state (EoS). Finally, we solve for new classes of $F(T,B)$ solutions for a scalar field source by assuming a power-law scalar field and then an exponential scalar field in terms of the time coordinate. For flat cosmological cases ($k=0$ cases), we find new exact and approximate $F(T,B)$ solutions. For non-flat cases ($k=\pm 1$ cases), we only find new teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for some specific and well-defined cosmological expansion subcases. We conclude by briefly discussing the impact of these new teleparallel solutions on cosmological processes such as dark energy (DE) quintessence and phantom energy models.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a spacetime interpretation of the confluent Heun functions within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and explores their relationship to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of these functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future timelike infinity. We also discuss the relationship between the confluent Heun functions and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Although neither confluent Heun form of the radial Teukolsky equation can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

Abstract: We construct {\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic refinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including the Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely $G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by $G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on Topological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and discusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting divisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>$N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model.
  As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in low-dimensional long-range random field Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-range random field Ising model in dimension $d = 1, 2$, whereas the long-range interaction is of the form $J_{xy} = |x-y|^{-\alpha}$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 3/2$ for $d=1$ and with $2 &lt; \alpha \leq 3$ for $d = 2$. Our main results establish phase transitions in these regimes. In one dimension, we employ a Peierls argument with some novel modification, suitable for dealing with the randomness coming from the external field; in two dimensions, our proof follows that of Affonso, Bissacot, and Maia (2023) with some adaptations, but new ideas are required in the critical case of $\alpha=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of a recently proposed efficiently implementable Lindbladian designed to prepare the Gibbs states in the setting of weakly interacting fermionic systems. We show that at any temperature, the Lindbladian spectral gap for even parity observables is lower bounded by a constant that is independent of the system size, when the interaction strength (e.g., the on-site interaction strength for the Fermi-Hubbard model) is below a constant threshold, which is also independent of the system size. This leads to a mixing time estimate that is at most linear in the system size, thus showing that the corresponding Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless aspects of axisymmetric velocity space</title>

Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) coupled with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the King mixture model (KMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic nonequilibrium plasmas.</description>
