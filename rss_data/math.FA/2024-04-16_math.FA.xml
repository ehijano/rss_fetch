      <title>Noncommutative domains, universal operator models, and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let B(H) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H. The main goal of the paper is to find large classes of noncommutative domains in B(H) with prescribed universal operator models, acting on the full Fock space with n generators, and to study these domains and their universal models in connection with the Hardy algebras and the C^*-algebras they generate.
  While the class of these domains contains the regular noncommutative domains previously studied in the literature, the main focus of the present paper is on the non-regular domains. The multi-variable operator theory of these domains is developed throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative domains, universal operator models, and operator algebras, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we introduced and studied the class of admissible noncommutative domains $D_{g^{-1}}(H)$ in $B(H)^n$ associated with admissible free holomorphic functions $g$ in noncommutative indeterminates $Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$. Each such a domain admits a universal model ${\bf W}:=(W_1,\ldots, W_n)$ of weighted left creation operators acting on the full Fock space with $n$ generators. In the present paper, we continue the study of these domains and their universal models in connection with the Hardy algebras and the $C^*$-algebras they generate. We obtain a Beurling type characterization of the invariant subspaces of the universal model ${\bf W}:=(W_1,\ldots, W_n)$ and develop a dilation theory for the elements of the noncommutative domain $D_{g^{-1}}(H)$. We also obtain results concerning the commutant lifting and Toeplitz-corrona in our setting as as well as some results on the boundary property for universal models.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative weighted shifts, joint similarity, and function theory in several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the structure of noncommutative weighted shifts, their properties, and to understand their role as models (up to similarity) for $n$-tuples of operators on Hilbert spaces as well as their implications to function theory on noncommutative (resp.commutative) Reinhardt domains. We obtain a Rota type similarity result concerning the joint similarity of $n$-tuples of operators to parts of noncommutative weighted multi-shifts and provide a noncommutative multivariable analogue of Foias-Pearcy model for quasinilpotent operators. The model noncommutative weighted multi-shift which is studied in this paper is the $n$-tuple $W=(W_1,\ldots, W_n)$, where $W_i$ are weighted left creation operators of the full Fock space with $n$ generators associated with a weight sequence $\boldsymbol \mu=\{\mu_\beta\}_{|\beta|\geq 1}$ of nonnegative numbers.
  We also represent the injective weighted multi-shifts $W_1,\ldots, W_n$ as ordinary multiplications by $Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$ on a Hilbert space of noncommutative formal power series. This leads naturally to analytic function theory in several complex variables. One of the goal for the remainder of the paper is to analyze the extent to which our noncommutative formal power series represent analytic functions in several noncommutative (resp. commutative) variables and to develop a functional calculus for arbitrary $n$-tuples of operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Invariant classes for families of complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of chain-cochain infinite complexes $\mathcal C$ of spaces with elements depending on a number of parameters, and endowed with a converging associative multiple product. The existence of left/right local/non-local square-vanishing ideals is assumed for subspaces of $\mathcal C$-spaces. We show that a set of differential and orthogonality relations together with coherence conditions on indices of a chain-cochain complex $\mathcal C$ elements generates families of graded differential algebras. With the appropriate orthogonality conditions on completions of $\mathcal C$ elements in the multiple product, we define the equivalence classes of cohomology invariants.</description>

      <title>A norm inequality on noncommutative symmetric spaces related to a question of Bourin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study a question introduced by Bourin \cite{2009Matrix} and partially solve the question of Bourin. In fact, for t\in[0,\frac{1}{4}]\cup[\frac{3}{4},1], we show that |||x^{t}y^{1-t}+y^{t}x^{1-t}|||\leq|||x+y|||, where x,y\in\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})^+ and \||\cdot\|| is the unitarily invariant norm. Moreover, we prove that the above inequality holds on noncommutative fully symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation via Sawyer-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-variable extension of Rubio de Francia's restricted weak-type extrapolation theory that does not involve Rubio de Francia's iteration algorithm; instead, we rely on the following Sawyer-type inequality for the weighted Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M_u$:
  $$ \left \Vert \frac{M_u (fv)}{v} \right \Vert_{L^{1,\infty}(uv)} \leq C_{u,v} \Vert f \Vert_{L^1(uv)}, \quad u, \, uv \in A_{\infty}. $$
  Our approach can be adapted to recover weak-type $A_{\vec P}$ extrapolation schemes, including an endpoint result that falls outside the classical theory.
  Among the applications of our work, we highlight extending outside the Banach range the well-known equivalence between restricted weak-type and weak-type for characteristic functions, and obtaining mixed and restricted weak-type bounds with $A_{p}^{\mathcal R}$ weights for relevant families of multi-variable operators, addressing the lack in the literature of these types of estimates. We also reveal several standalone properties of the class $A_{p}^{\mathcal R}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Integral Estimates of Hermite-Hadamard type in Global Nonpositive Curvature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of convexity of functions defined on global nonpositive curvature spaces by introducing (geodesically) $h$-convex functions. We prove estimates of Hermite-Hadamard type via Katugampola's fractional integrals. We obtain an important corollary which gives an essentially sharp estimate involving squared distance mappings between points in a global NPC space. This is a contribution to analysis on spaces with curved geometry.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of limits at infinity for bounded variation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of limits at infinity along almost every infinite curve for the upper and lower approximate limits of bounded variation functions on complete unbounded metric measure spaces. We prove that if the measure is doubling and supports a $1$-Poincar\'e inequality, then for every bounded variation function $f$ and for $1$-a.e. infinite curve $\gamma$, for both the upper approximate limit $f^\vee$ and the lower approximate limit $f^\wedge$ we have that \[ \lim_{t\to+\infty}f^\vee(\gamma(t)) {\rm \ \ and\ \ }\lim_{t\to+\infty}f^\wedge(\gamma(t)) \] exist and are equal to the same finite value. We give examples showing that the conditions of doubling and a $1$-Poincar\'e inequality are also necessary for the existence of limits. Furthermore, we establish a characterization for strictly positive $1$-modulus of the family of all infinite curves in terms of bounded variation functions. These generalize results for Sobolev functions given in \cite{KN23}.</description>

      <title>Swarm dynamics for global optimisation on finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the global optimisation of a function $U$ defined on a finite set $V$ endowed with an irreducible and reversible Markov generator.By integration, we  extend $U$ to the set $\mathcal{P}(V)$ of probability distributions on $V$ and we penalise it with a time-dependent generalised entropy functional.Endowing $\mathcal{P}(V)$ with a Maas' Wasserstein-type Riemannian structure, enables us to consider an associated time-inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm.There are several ways to interpret this $\cP(V)$-valued dynamical system as the time-marginal laws of a time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process taking values in $V$, each of them allowing for interacting particle approximations.This procedure extends to the discrete framework the continuous state space swarm algorithm approach of Bolte, Miclo and Villeneuve \cite{Bolte}, but here we go further by considering more general generalised entropy functionals for which functional inequalities can be proven.Thus in the full generality of the above finite framework, we  give conditions on the underlying time dependence ensuring the convergence of the algorithm toward laws supported by the set of global minima of $U$.Numerical simulations illustrate that one has to be careful about the choice of the time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process  interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Necessary and sufficient conditions are offered for Sobolev type spaces built on rearrangement-invariant spaces to be continuously embedded into (generalized) Campanato and Morrey spaces on open subsets of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. As a consequence, the optimal target and domain spaces in the relevant embeddings are identified. Our general criteria are implemented to derive sharp embeddings in the class of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce the new concepts of continuous bi-g-frames and continuous K-bi-g-frame for Hilbert spaces. Then, we examine some characterizations properties with the help of a biframe operator. Finally, we investigate several results about the stability of continuous bi-g-Bessel sequence and K-bi-g-frame are produced via the use of frame theory methods.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Quotient Modules of Finite Length and Their Relation to Fredholm Elements in Semiprime Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B. A. Barnes introduced so-called Fredholm elements in a semiprime ring whose definition is inspired by Atkinson's theorem. Here the socle of a semiprime ring generalizes the ideal of finite-rank operators on a Banach space. In this paper, we aim to see that the algebraic concept of the length of a module is strongly related to that of Fredholm elements. This motivates another generalization of Fredholm elements by requiring for an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ that the $\mathcal{A}$-modules of the form $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ are of finite length. We are particularly interested in sufficient conditions for our generalized Fredholm elements to be Fredholm. In a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ we shall even see that an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ is Fredholm if and only if the $\mathcal{A}$-modules $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ both have finite length.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma) &lt; \mathcal{A} &lt; C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A} = C(Y) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu) \rtimes \Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

The results of boundedness include Lebesgue and generalized Morrey spaces as special cases. Further, we characterize the boundedness of composition operators on the weak Orlicz-Morrey spaces. The weak Orlicz-Morrey spaces contain the Orlicz-Morrey spaces.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing a recent result on lineability of sets of non-injective linear operators, we prove, for quite general linear spaces $A$ of maps from an arbitraty set to a sequence space, that, for every $0 \neq f \in A$, the subset of $A$ of non-injective maps contains an infinite dimensional subspace of $A$ containing $f$. We provide aplications of the main result to spaces of linear operators between quasi-Banach spaces, to spaces of linear operators belonging to an operator ideal, and, in the nonlinear setting, to linear spaces of homogeneous polynomials and to linear spaces of vector-valued Lispshitz functions on metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Computing Brascamp-Lieb Constants through the lens of Thompson Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies algorithms for efficiently computing Brascamp-Lieb constants, a task that has recently received much interest. In particular, we reduce the computation to a nonlinear matrix-valued iteration, whose convergence we analyze through the lens of fixed-point methods under the well-known Thompson metric. This approach permits us to obtain (weakly) polynomial time guarantees, and it offers an efficient and transparent alternative to previous state-of-the-art approaches based on Riemannian optimization and geodesic convexity.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Factors for Actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ and Other Non-$C^*$-Simple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group and $(X, \Gamma)$ a compact topological dynamical system. We study the question of the existence of an intermediate $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{A}$ $$C^{*}_{r}(\Gamma)&lt;\mathcal{A}&lt;C(X)\rtimes_r\Gamma,$$ which is not of the form $\mathcal{A} = C(Y) \rtimes_r \Gamma$, corresponding to a factor map $(X,\Gamma) \to (Y,\Gamma)$. Here $ C^{*}_{r} (\Gamma)$ and $C(X) \rtimes_r \Gamma$ are the reduced $C^*$-algebras of $\Gamma$ and $(X,\Gamma)$ respectively. Our main results are (1) For $\Gamma$, which is not $C^*$-simple, if $(X,\Gamma)$ admits a $\Gamma$-invariant probability measure, then such a sub-algebra always exists. (2) For $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}$ and $(X, \Gamma)$ an irrational rotation of the circle $X = S^1$, we give a full description of all these non-crossed-product subalgebras.</description>

      <title>On the sharpness of some quantitative Muckenhoupt-Wheeden inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work by Cruz-Uribe et al. was obtained that \[|\{x\in{\mathbb{R}^d}:w(x)|G(fw^{-1})(x)|&gt;\alpha\}|\lesssim\frac{[w]_{A_1}^2}{\alpha}\int_{{\mathbb{R}^d}}|f|dx\] both in the matrix and scalar settings, where $G$ is either the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function or any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator. In this note we show that the quadratic dependence on $[w]_{A_1}$ is sharp. This is done by constructing a sequence of scalar-valued weights with blowing up characteristics so that the corresponding bounds for the Hilbert transform and maximal function are exactly quadratic.</description>

      <title>A convergence result of a continuous model of deep learning via \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a Wasserstein-type gradient flow, which represents an optimization process of a continuous model of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). First, we establish the existence of a minimizer for an average loss of the model under $L^2$-regularization. Subsequently, we show the existence of a curve of maximal slope of the loss. Our main result is the convergence of flow to a critical point of the loss as time goes to infinity. An essential aspect of proving this result involves the establishment of the \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon gradient inequality for the loss. We derive this inequality by assuming the analyticity of NNs and loss functions. Our proofs offer a new approach for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of Wasserstein-type gradient flows for nonconvex functionals.</description>

      <title>Complete frequencies for Koenigs domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of those non-elliptic semigroups of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc for which the linear span of eigenvectors of the generator of the corresponding semigroup of composition operators is weak-star dense in $H^\infty$. We also give some necessary and sufficient conditions for completeness in $H^p$. This problem is equivalent to the completeness of the corresponding exponential functions in $H^\infty$ (in the weak-star sense) or in $H^p$ of the Koenigs domain of the semigroup. As a tool needed for the results, we introduce and study discontinuities of semigroups of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc.</description>

      <title>Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture is false</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture predicts that if the non-commutative Choquet boundary of a separable operator system $\mathcal{S}$ is the entire spectrum of its generated C*-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ then $\mathcal{S}$ is hyperrigid in $\mathcal{B}$. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture with a C*-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of type I generated by a single operator.</description>
