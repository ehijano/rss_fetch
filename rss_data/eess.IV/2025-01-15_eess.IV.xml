      <title>An Intra- and Cross-frame Topological Consistency Scheme for Semi-supervised Atherosclerotic Coronary Plaque Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of segmenting coronary atherosclerotic plaques from CT Angiography (CTA) images is pivotal for advanced Coronary Atherosclerosis Analysis (CAA), which distinctively relies on the analysis of vessel cross-section images reconstructed via Curved Planar Reformation. This task presents significant challenges due to the indistinct boundaries and structures of plaques and blood vessels, leading to the inadequate performance of current deep learning models, compounded by the inherent difficulty in annotating such complex data. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-consistency semi-supervised framework that integrates Intra-frame Topological Consistency (ITC) and Cross-frame Topological Consistency (CTC) to leverage labeled and unlabeled data. ITC employs a dual-task network for simultaneous segmentation mask and Skeleton-aware Distance Transform (SDT) prediction, achieving similar prediction of topology structure through consistency constraint without additional annotations. Meanwhile, CTC utilizes an unsupervised estimator for analyzing pixel flow between skeletons and boundaries of adjacent frames, ensuring spatial continuity. Experiments on two CTA datasets show that our method surpasses existing semi-supervised methods and approaches the performance of supervised methods on CAA. In addition, our method also performs better than other methods on the ACDC dataset, demonstrating its generalization.</description>

      <title>Early prediction of the transferability of bovine embryos from videomicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videomicroscopy is a promising tool combined with machine learning for studying the early development of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos and assessing its transferability as soon as possible. We aim to predict the embryo transferability within four days at most, taking 2D time-lapse microscopy videos as input. We formulate this problem as a supervised binary classification problem for the classes transferable and not transferable. The challenges are three-fold: 1) poorly discriminating appearance and motion, 2) class ambiguity, 3) small amount of annotated data. We propose a 3D convolutional neural network involving three pathways, which makes it multi-scale in time and able to handle appearance and motion in different ways. For training, we retain the focal loss. Our model, named SFR, compares favorably to other methods. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy for our challenging biological task.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: VAE as an inference paradigm for neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we explore Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an essential framework for unsupervised learning, particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets such as neuroimaging. By integrating deep learning with Bayesian inference, VAEs enable the generation of interpretable latent representations. This tutorial outlines the theoretical foundations of VAEs, addresses practical challenges such as convergence issues and over-fitting, and discusses strategies like the reparameterization trick and hyperparameter optimization. We also highlight key applications of VAEs in neuroimaging, demonstrating their potential to uncover meaningful patterns, including those associated with neurodegenerative processes, and their broader implications for analyzing complex brain data.</description>

      <title>CellOMaps: A Compact Representation for Robust Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease, characterized by five primary histological growth patterns. The classification of such patterns is crucial due to their direct relation to prognosis but the high subjectivity and observer variability pose a major challenge. Although several studies have developed machine learning methods for growth pattern classification, they either only report the predominant pattern per slide or lack proper evaluation. We propose a generalizable machine learning pipeline capable of classifying lung tissue into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor. The proposed pipeline's strength lies in a novel compact Cell Organization Maps (cellOMaps) representation that captures the cellular spatial patterns from Hematoxylin and Eosin whole slide images (WSIs). The proposed pipeline provides state-of-the-art performance on LUAD growth pattern classification when evaluated on both internal unseen slides and external datasets, significantly outperforming the current approaches. In addition, our preliminary results show that the model's outputs can be used to predict patients Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) levels.</description>

      <title>DM-Mamba: Dual-domain Multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction poses a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the significant undersampling in k-space. Deep neural networks, such as CNNs and ViT, have shown substantial performance improvements for this task while encountering the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation. To this end, this paper pioneers exploring Mamba, a new paradigm for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, for efficient and effective MRI reconstruction. However, directly applying Mamba to MRI reconstruction faces three significant issues: (1) Mamba's row-wise and column-wise scanning disrupts k-space's unique spectrum, leaving its potential in k-space learning unexplored. (2) Existing Mamba methods unfold feature maps with multiple lengthy scanning paths, leading to long-range forgetting and high computational burden. (3) Mamba struggles with spatially-varying contents, resulting in limited diversity of local representations. To address these, we propose a dual-domain multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction from the following perspectives: (1) We pioneer vision Mamba in k-space learning. A circular scanning is customized for spectrum unfolding, benefiting the global modeling of k-space. (2) We propose a multi-scale Mamba with an efficient scanning strategy in both image and k-space domains. It mitigates long-range forgetting and achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and performance. (3) We develop a local diversity enhancement module to improve the spatially-varying representation of Mamba. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets for MRI reconstruction under various undersampling patterns. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost. Implementation code will be available at https://github.com/XiaoMengLiLiLi/DM-Mamba.</description>

      <title>Universal Training of Neural Networks to Achieve Bayes Optimal Classification Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work invokes the notion of $f$-divergence to introduce a novel upper bound on the Bayes error rate of a general classification task. We show that the proposed bound can be computed by sampling from the output of a parameterized model. Using this practical interpretation, we introduce the Bayes optimal learning threshold (BOLT) loss whose minimization enforces a classification model to achieve the Bayes error rate. We validate the proposed loss for image and text classification tasks, considering MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDb datasets. Numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained with BOLT achieve performance on par with or exceeding that of cross-entropy, particularly on challenging datasets. This highlights the potential of BOLT in improving generalization.</description>

      <title>A Low-cost and Ultra-lightweight Binary Neural Network for Traffic Signal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of neural networks in vehicle platforms and wearable Artificial Intelligence-of-Things (AIOT) scenarios has become a research area that has attracted much attention. With the continuous evolution of deep learning technology, many image classification models are committed to improving recognition accuracy, but this is often accompanied by problems such as large model resource usage, complex structure, and high power consumption, which makes it challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. Herein, we propose an ultra-lightweight binary neural network (BNN) model designed for hardware deployment, and conduct image classification research based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. In addition, we also verify it on the Chinese Traffic Sign (CTS) and Belgian Traffic Sign (BTS) datasets. The proposed model shows excellent recognition performance with an accuracy of up to 97.64%, making it one of the best performing BNN models in the GTSRB dataset. Compared with the full-precision model, the accuracy loss is controlled within 1%, and the parameter storage overhead of the model is only 10% of that of the full-precision model. More importantly, our network model only relies on logical operations and low-bit width fixed-point addition and subtraction operations during the inference phase, which greatly simplifies the design complexity of the processing element (PE). Our research shows the great potential of BNN in the hardware deployment of computer vision models, especially in the field of computer vision tasks related to autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Cloud Removal With PolSAR-Optical Data Fusion Using A Two-Flow Residual Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical remote sensing images play a crucial role in the observation of the Earth's surface. However, obtaining complete optical remote sensing images is challenging due to cloud cover. Reconstructing cloud-free optical images has become a major task in recent years. This paper presents a two-flow Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR)-Optical data fusion cloud removal algorithm (PODF-CR), which achieves the reconstruction of missing optical images. PODF-CR consists of an encoding module and a decoding module. The encoding module includes two parallel branches that extract PolSAR image features and optical image features. To address speckle noise in PolSAR images, we introduce dynamic filters in the PolSAR branch for image denoising. To better facilitate the fusion between multimodal optical images and PolSAR images, we propose fusion blocks based on cross-skip connections to enable interaction of multimodal data information. The obtained fusion features are refined through an attention mechanism to provide better conditions for the subsequent decoding of the fused images. In the decoding module, multi-scale convolution is introduced to obtain multi-scale information. Additionally, to better utilize comprehensive scattering information and polarization characteristics to assist in the restoration of optical images, we use a dataset for cloud restoration called OPT-BCFSAR-PFSAR, which includes backscatter coefficient feature images and polarization feature images obtained from PoLSAR data and optical images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Robust Hyperspectral Image Panshapring via Sparse Spatial-Spectral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution hyperspectral imaging plays a crucial role in various remote sensing applications, yet its acquisition often faces fundamental limitations due to hardware constraints. This paper introduces S$^{3}$RNet, a novel framework for hyperspectral image pansharpening that effectively combines low-resolution hyperspectral images (LRHSI) with high-resolution multispectral images (HRMSI) through sparse spatial-spectral representation. The core of S$^{3}$RNet is the Multi-Branch Fusion Network (MBFN), which employs parallel branches to capture complementary features at different spatial and spectral scales. Unlike traditional approaches that treat all features equally, our Spatial-Spectral Attention Weight Block (SSAWB) dynamically adjusts feature weights to maintain sparse representation while suppressing noise and redundancy. To enhance feature propagation, we incorporate the Dense Feature Aggregation Block (DFAB), which efficiently aggregates inputted features through dense connectivity patterns. This integrated design enables S$^{3}$RNet to selectively emphasize the most informative features from differnt scale while maintaining computational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that S$^{3}$RNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, showing particular strength in maintaining high reconstruction quality even under challenging noise conditions. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate combining imaging and shape features extracted from MRI for the clinically relevant tasks of brain age prediction and Alzheimer's disease classification. Our proposed model fuses ResNet-extracted image embeddings with shape embeddings from a bespoke graph neural network. The shape embeddings are derived from surface meshes of 15 brain structures, capturing detailed geometric information. Combined with the appearance features from T1-weighted images, we observe improvements in the prediction performance on both tasks, with substantial gains for classification. We evaluate the model using public datasets, including CamCAN, IXI, and OASIS3, demonstrating the effectiveness of fusing imaging and shape features for brain analysis.</description>

      <title>DisCoPatch: Batch Statistics Are All You Need For OOD Detection, But Only If You Can Trust Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code will be made publicly available</description>

      <title>Evaluating Human Perception of Novel View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment of Gaussian Splatting and NeRF in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are two groundbreaking technologies that have revolutionized the field of Novel View Synthesis (NVS), enabling immersive photorealistic rendering and user experiences by synthesizing multiple viewpoints from a set of images of sparse views. The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</description>

      <title>AI Driven Water Segmentation with deep learning models for Enhanced Flood Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flooding is a major natural hazard causing significant fatalities and economic losses annually, with increasing frequency due to climate change. Rapid and accurate flood detection and monitoring are crucial for mitigating these impacts. This study compares the performance of three deep learning models UNet, ResNet, and DeepLabv3 for pixelwise water segmentation to aid in flood detection, utilizing images from drones, in field observations, and social media. This study involves creating a new dataset that augments wellknown benchmark datasets with flood-specific images, enhancing the robustness of the models. The UNet, ResNet, and DeepLab v3 architectures are tested to determine their effectiveness in various environmental conditions and geographical locations, and the strengths and limitations of each model are also discussed here, providing insights into their applicability in different scenarios by predicting image segmentation masks. This fully automated approach allows these models to isolate flooded areas in images, significantly reducing processing time compared to traditional semi-automated methods. The outcome of this study is to predict segmented masks for each image effected by a flood disaster and the validation accuracy of these models. This methodology facilitates timely and continuous flood monitoring, providing vital data for emergency response teams to reduce loss of life and economic damages. It offers a significant reduction in the time required to generate flood maps, cutting down the manual processing time. Additionally, we present avenues for future research, including the integration of multimodal data sources and the development of robust deep learning architectures tailored specifically for flood detection tasks. Overall, our work contributes to the advancement of flood management strategies through innovative use of deep learning technologies.</description>

Abstract: Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Masked Image Modeling to Avoid Model Collapse on Multi-modal MRI Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information of lesions for computer-aided diagnosis from different views. Deep learning algorithms are suitable for identifying specific anatomical structures, segmenting lesions, and classifying diseases. Manual labels are limited due to the high expense, which hinders further improvement of accuracy. Self-supervised learning, particularly masked image modeling (MIM), has shown promise in utilizing unlabeled data. However, we spot model collapse when applying MIM to multi-modal MRI datasets. The performance of downstream tasks does not see any improvement following the collapsed model. To solve model collapse, we analyze and address it in two types: complete collapse and dimensional collapse. We find complete collapse occurs because the collapsed loss value in multi-modal MRI datasets falls below the normally converged loss value. Based on this, the hybrid mask pattern (HMP) masking strategy is introduced to elevate the collapsed loss above the normally converged loss value and avoid complete collapse. Additionally, we reveal that dimensional collapse stems from insufficient feature uniformity in MIM. We mitigate dimensional collapse by introducing the pyramid barlow twins (PBT) module as an explicit regularization method. Overall, we construct the enhanced MIM (E-MIM) with HMP and PBT module to avoid model collapse multi-modal MRI. Experiments are conducted on three multi-modal MRI datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing both types of model collapse. By preventing model collapse, the training of the model becomes more stable, resulting in a decent improvement in performance for segmentation and classification tasks.

      <title>Zero-shot 3D Segmentation of Abdominal Organs in CT Scans Using Segment Anything Model 2: Adapting Video Tracking Capabilities for 3D Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the zero-shot performance of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) in 3D segmentation of abdominal organs in CT scans, and to investigate the effects of prompt settings on segmentation results.
  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we used a subset of the TotalSegmentator CT dataset from eight institutions to assess SAM 2's ability to segment eight abdominal organs. Segmentation was initiated from three different z-coordinate levels (caudal, mid, and cranial levels) of each organ. Performance was measured using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). We also analyzed the impact of "negative prompts," which explicitly exclude certain regions from the segmentation process, on accuracy.
  Results: 123 patients (mean age, 60.7 \pm 15.5 years; 63 men, 60 women) were evaluated. As a zero-shot approach, larger organs with clear boundaries demonstrated high segmentation performance, with mean DSCs as follows: liver 0.821 \pm 0.192, right kidney 0.862 \pm 0.212, left kidney 0.870 \pm 0.154, and spleen 0.891 \pm 0.131. Smaller organs showed lower performance: gallbladder 0.531 \pm 0.291, pancreas 0.361 \pm 0.197, and adrenal glands, right 0.203 \pm 0.222, left 0.308 \pm 0.234. The initial slice for segmentation and the use of negative prompts significantly influenced the results. By removing negative prompts from the input, the DSCs significantly decreased for six organs.
  Conclusion: SAM 2 demonstrated promising zero-shot performance in segmenting certain abdominal organs in CT scans, particularly larger organs. Performance was significantly influenced by input negative prompts and initial slice selection, highlighting the importance of optimizing these factors.</description>

      <title>A Cascaded Dilated Convolution Approach for Mpox Lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global outbreak of the Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods for Mpox, which rely on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, are slow and labor intensive. Deep learning-based approaches for skin lesion classification offer a promising alternative. However, developing a model that balances efficiency with accuracy is crucial to ensure reliable and timely diagnosis without compromising performance. This study introduces the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) framework to address these challenges, combining the Cascaded Atrous Attention module and the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism. The Cascaded Atrous Attention module utilizes dilated convolutions and cascades the outputs to enhance multi-scale representation. This is integrated into the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism, which reduces redundancy in Multi-Head Self-Attention. By integrating the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention module with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an accuracy of 98% on the Mpox Close Skin Image (MCSI) dataset while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. The model's robustness is demonstrated through extensive validation on two additional benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>HyFusion: Enhanced Reception Field Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion addresses the challenge of reconstructing High-Resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs) from High-Resolution Multispectral images (HR-MSIs) and Low-Resolution HSIs (LR-HSIs), a critical task given the high costs and hardware limitations associated with acquiring high-quality HSIs. While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) framework designed to enhance cross-domain feature extraction and enable effective feature map reusing. The framework first processes HR-MSI and LR-HSI inputs through specialized subnetworks that mutually enhance each other during feature extraction, preserving complementary spatial and spectral details. At its core, HyFusion utilizes an Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB), which combines shifting-window attention and dense connections to expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing into a coupled network architecture, HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral imaging. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equipped with the continuous representation capability of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, the limited receptive field of the linear layers in MLP restricts the representation capability of INR, while it is computationally expensive to query the MLP numerous times to render each pixel. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted contiguous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

      <title>A systematic review of the use of Deep Learning in Satellite Imagery for Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agricultural research is essential for increasing food production to meet the requirements of an increasing population in the coming decades. Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks; the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies.</description>

      <title>WINE: Wavelet-Guided GAN Inversion and Editing for High-Fidelity Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advanced GAN inversion models aim to convey high-fidelity information from original images to generators through methods using generator tuning or high-dimensional feature learning. Despite these efforts, accurately reconstructing image-specific details remains as a challenge due to the inherent limitations both in terms of training and structural aspects, leading to a bias towards low-frequency information. In this paper, we look into the widely used pixel loss in GAN inversion, revealing its predominant focus on the reconstruction of low-frequency features. We then propose WINE, a Wavelet-guided GAN Inversion aNd Editing model, which transfers the high-frequency information through wavelet coefficients via newly proposed wavelet loss and wavelet fusion scheme. Notably, WINE is the first attempt to interpret GAN inversion in the frequency domain. Our experimental results showcase the precision of WINE in preserving high-frequency details and enhancing image quality. Even in editing scenarios, WINE outperforms existing state-of-the-art GAN inversion models with a fine balance between editability and reconstruction quality.</description>
