      <title>Energy-Efficient Cryogenic Ternary Content Addressable Memory using Ferroelectric SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) are useful for certain computing tasks since they allow us to compare a search query with a whole dataset stored in the memory array. They can also unlock unique advantages for cryogenic applications like quantum computing, high-performance computing, and space exploration by improving speed and energy efficiency through parallel searching. This paper explores the design and implementation of a cryogenic ternary content addressable memory based on ferroelectric superconducting quantum interference devices (FeSQUIDs). The use of FeSQUID for designing the TCAM provides several unique advantages. First, we can get binary decisions (zero or non-zero voltage) for matching and mismatching conditions without using any peripheral circuitry. Moreover, the proposed TCAM needs ultra-low energy (1.36 aJ and 26.5 aJ average energy consumption for 1-bit binary and ternary search, respectively), thanks to the use of energy-efficient SQUIDs. Finally, we show the efficiency of FeSQUID through the brain-inspired application of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). Here, the FeSQUID-based TCAM implements the associative memory to support the highly parallel search needed in the inference step. We estimate an energy consumption of 89.4 fJ per vector comparison using a vector size of 10,000 bits. We also compare the FeSQUID-based TCAM array with the 5nm FinFET-based cryogenic SRAM-based TCAM array and observe that the proposed FeSQUID-based TCAM array consumes over one order of magnitude lower energy while performing the same task.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Mathematical Modeling of Stress Communication Between Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is an important communication paradigm found in nature. Odor-based Molecular Communication (OMC) is a specific type of MC with promising potential and a wide range of applications. In this paper, we examine OMC communication between plants in the context of stress communication. Specifically, we explore how plants use Biological Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) to convey information about the stresses they are experiencing to neighboring plants. We constructed an end-to-end mathematical model that discovers the underlying physical and biological phenomena affecting stress communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model this end-to-end stress communication. We numerically analyzed our system under different scenarios using MATLAB. Using experimental data from the literature, we demonstrated that continuous gene regulation can approximate BVOC emissions in plants under different stress conditions. Consequently, we applied this model to these stressors and plants to accurately approximate BVOC emissions. We also investigated a modulation method that plants use to send their messages, namely Ratio Shift Keying. Upon analyzing this method, we found that it benefits plants by both enabling a multiple access channel and preventing competitor plants from obtaining the information.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits via Intermediary Matrix Product Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Smartphone-based Spectrophotometry for Nutrient Identification and Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11027v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced nutrition is a global health issue with significant downstream effects. Current methods of assessing nutrient levels face several limitations, with accessibility being a major concern. In this paper, we take a step towards accessibly measuring nutrient status within the body. We explore the potential of smartphone-based spectrophotometry for identifying and quantifying nutrients in a solution by building and testing two prototype devices. We compared the prototypes and found that the limitations posed by the initial, simpler prototype were well addressed in the more portable and reliable second-generation device. With the second-generation prototype, we created and implemented a semi-automatic signal processing and analysis pipeline for analyzing absorption spectra. We thoroughly evaluated the prototypes by analyzing the effect of four different light sources and three reference spectra strategies. Results demonstrate that an LED bulb light source performed best, and all reference spectra strategies performed similarly. We then compared the second-generation prototype to a benchtop laboratory spectrophotometer to further validate the device. We applied the Beer-Lambert Law to demonstrate that our prototype is able to quantify the amount of vitamin B12 in a solution with an accuracy of up to 91.3%. Our in-depth analyses, discussions, and results demonstrate the potential use of smartphone-based spectrophotometry as an accessible method to identify and quantify nutrients and pave the way for future developments that can apply this approach to the human body.</description>

      <title>BRC20 Pinning Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BRC20 tokens are a type of non-fungible asset on the Bitcoin network. They allow users to embed customized content within Bitcoin satoshis. The related token frenzy has reached a market size of USD 3,650b over the past year (2023Q3-2024Q3). However, this intuitive design has not undergone serious security scrutiny.
  We present the first in-depth analysis of the BRC20 transfer mechanism and identify a critical attack vector. A typical BRC20 transfer involves two bundled on-chain transactions with different fee levels: the first (i.e., Tx1) with a lower fee inscribes the transfer request, while the second (i.e., Tx2) with a higher fee finalizes the actual transfer. We find that an adversary can exploit this by sending a manipulated fee transaction (falling between the two fee levels), which allows Tx1 to be processed while Tx2 remains pinned in the mempool. This locks the BRC20 liquidity and disrupts normal transfers for users. We term this BRC20 pinning attack.
  Our attack exposes an inherent design flaw that can be applied to 90+% inscription-based tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
  We also conducted the attack on Binance's ORDI hot wallet (the most prevalent BRC20 token and the most active wallet), resulting in a temporary suspension of ORDI withdrawals on Binance for 3.5 hours, which were shortly resumed after our communication.</description>

      <title>Sorted Weight Sectioning for Energy-Efficient Unstructured Sparse DNNs on Compute-in-Memory Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{sorted weight sectioning}$ (SWS): a weight allocation algorithm that places sorted deep neural network (DNN) weight sections on bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars to reduce analog-to-digital converter (ADC) energy consumption. Data conversions are the most energy-intensive process in crossbar operation. SWS effectively reduces this cost leveraging (1) small weights and (2) zero weights (weight sparsity).
  DNN weights follow bell-shaped distributions, with most weights near zero. Using SWS, we only need low-order crossbar columns for sections with low-magnitude weights. This reduces the quantity and resolution of ADCs used, exponentially decreasing ADC energy costs without significantly degrading DNN accuracy.
  Unstructured sparsification further sharpens the weight distribution with small accuracy loss. However, it presents challenges in hardware tracking of zeros: we cannot switch zero rows to other layer weights in unsorted crossbars without index matching. SWS efficiently addresses unstructured sparse models using offline remapping of zeros into earlier sections, which reveals full sparsity potential and maximizes energy efficiency.
  Our method reduces ADC energy use by 89.5% on unstructured sparse BERT models. Overall, this paper introduces a novel algorithm to promote energy-efficient CIM crossbars for unstructured sparse DNN workloads.</description>

      <title>Solving rescheduling problems in heterogeneous urban railway networks using hybrid quantum-classical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear model for the given problem and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments and covers all the requirements posed by the operator of the network. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. At the same time, the solutions that were obtained were feasible. Moreover, though they are probabilistic (heuristics) they offer a valid alternative by returning a range of possible solutions the dispatcher can choose from. And, most importantly, they outperform classical solvers in some cases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hybrid Model Pruning in Federated Learning through Loss Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of smart devices coupled with the advent of 6G networks has profoundly reshaped the domain of collaborative machine learning. Alongside growing privacy-security concerns in sensitive fields, these developments have positioned federated learning (FL) as a pivotal technology for decentralized model training. Despite its vast potential, specially in the age of complex foundation models, FL encounters challenges such as elevated communication costs, computational constraints, and the complexities of non-IID data distributions. We introduce AutoFLIP, an innovative approach that utilizes a federated loss exploration phase to drive adaptive hybrid pruning, operating in a structured and unstructured way. This innovative mechanism automatically identifies and prunes model substructure by distilling knowledge on model gradients behavior across different non-IID client losses topology, thereby optimizing computational efficiency and enhancing model performance on resource constrained scenarios. Extensive experiments on various datasets and FL tasks reveal that AutoFLIP not only efficiently accelerates global convergence, but also achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. On average, AutoFLIP reduces computational overhead by 48.8% and communication costs by 35.5%, while improving global accuracy. By significantly reducing these overheads, AutoFLIP offer the way for efficient FL deployment in real-world applications for a scalable and broad applicability.</description>
