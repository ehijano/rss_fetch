      <title>When Sellers Are Uncertain about Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-hand markets have expanded rapidly with the growth of online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms. A key feature of C2C markets is that sellers are typically non-professionals and often face uncertainty about the quality of the goods they sell. This creates scope for platforms to introduce systems that reduce sellers' uncertainty about quality. However, an important question remains: is it socially desirable for sellers to have more precise quality information? We present results showing that while improved information always benefits sellers, it can either benefit or harm buyers. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which buyers benefit, and show that this condition holds in many cases, especially when buyers' valuations are not too large relative to sellers' costs. These findings suggest that platforms should consider reducing sellers' uncertainty about quality as a means of improving market efficiency.</description>

      <title>Confidence and Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miscalibrated beliefs are widely viewed as compromising the quality of employees' decisions. Why, then, might an organization prefer to hire an individual known to be overconfident? This paper develops a theory of organizational demand for employees' levels of confidence when private information interacts with conflicts of interest. I study a model in which an employee uses private information to make decisions on behalf of the organization and analyze the belief design problem, namely, how the organization would like the employee to interpret his observations. I show that organizations prefer employees whose actions reflect a constant expected conflict of interest across observations. A well-calibrated employee is optimal if and only if private information does not affect this conflict. When the conflict varies with information, organizations optimally select employees whose confidence distorts their responses to information. Overconfidence is optimal when the organization seeks stronger adjustments to information than a well-calibrated employee would provide.</description>

      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>

      <title>Matching with Generalized Sequential Choice Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a many-to-one matching between individuals and institutions where institutions comprise multiple divisions and face cross-divisional constraints. We introduce a parametrized family of choice rules, which we call generalized sequential (GSq), that encompasses many different choice rules encountered in practice and in market design literature. We show that the cumulative offer mechanism (COM) is the unique stable and strategy-proof mechanism in a matching problem where all institutions have a GSq choice rule. We present two real-world applications in which choice rules in the GSq family emerge naturally: affirmative action in India's public higher educational institutions and government jobs, and high school admissions in China.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Optimal Control of Pollution Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a model for the optimal control (by a centralized economic agent which we call the planner) of pollution diffusion over time and space. The controls are the investments in production and depollution and the goal is to maximize an intertemporal utility function. The main novelty is the fact that the spatial component has a network structure. Moreover, in such a time-space setting we also analyze the trade-off between the use of green or non-green technologies: this also seems to be a novelty in such a setting. Extending methods of previous papers, we can solve explicitly the problem in the case of linear costs of pollution.</description>

      <title>From Design to Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of hard information in contractual and market settings in which the receiver can flexibly adjust allocations and transfers in response to the sender's disclosure. These settings include monopoly pricing, bilateral trade with interdependent values, insurance contracting, and policy negotiations. Across these settings, the sender is worst off if she reveals her type completely: if her type becomes known, the receiver can adjust the terms of trade to extract her surplus. Taking this feature as our central departure from the literature, we characterize the entire set of equilibrium payoffs across these disclosure games. We establish an equivalence result: every payoff profile that can be achieved through information design can also be approximated by an equilibrium of the disclosure game. Thus, hard information enables the sender to attain her commitment payoff without having to commit to an information structure. Moreover, this result highlights how verifiability can empower the sender in settings in which bargaining power resides with the receiver.</description>

      <title>Selling Multiple Items to a Unit-Demand Buyer via Automated Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the optimal (revenue-maximizing) mechanism to sell multiple items has been a prominent and notoriously difficult open problem. Existing work has mainly focused on deriving analytical results tailored to a particular class of problems (for example, Giannakopoulos, 2015; Yang, 2025). The present paper explores the possibility of a generally applicable methodology of the Automated Mechanism Design (AMD). We first employ the deep learning algorithm developed by D\"utting et al. (2023) to numerically solve small-sized problems, and the results are then generalized by educated guesswork and finally rigorously verified through duality. By focusing on a single buyer who can consume one item, our approach leads to two key contributions: establishing a much simpler way to verify the optimality of a wide range of problems and discovering a completely new result about the optimality of uniform pricing. First, we show that selling each item at an identical price (or equivalently, selling the grand bundle of all items) is optimal for any number of items when the value distributions belong to a class that includes the uniform distribution as a special case. Different items are allowed to have different distributions. Second, for each number of items, we established necessary and sufficient conditions that $c$ must satisfy for uniform pricing to be optimal when the value distribution is uniform over an interval $[c, c+1]$. This latter model does not satisfy the previously known sufficient conditions for the optimality of grand bundling (Haghpanah &amp; Hartline, 2021). Our results are in contrast to the only known results for $n$ items (for any $n$), Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017), which consider a single buyer with additive preferences, where the values of items are narrowly restricted to i.i.d. according to a uniform or exponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Information without Transitivity and Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I relax the standard assumptions of transitivity and partition structure in economic models of information to formalize vague knowledge: non-transitive indistinguishability over states. I show that vague knowledge, while failing to partition the state space, remains informative by distinguishing some states from others. Moreover, it can only be faithfully expressed through vague communication with blurred boundaries. My results provide microfoundations for the prevalence of natural language communication and qualitative reasoning in the real world, where knowledge is often vague.</description>

      <title>Team Disagreement and Productive Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how open disagreement influences team performance in a dynamic production game. Team members can hold different priors about the productivity of the available production technologies. Initial beliefs are common knowledge and updated based on observed production outcomes. We show that when only one technology is available, a player works harder early on when her coworkers are initially more pessimistic about the technology's productivity. Holding average team optimism constant, this force implies that a team's expected output increases in the degree of disagreement of its members. A manager with the task of forming two-member teams from a large workforce maximizes total expected output by matching coworkers' beliefs in a negative assortative way. When alternative, equally good, production technologies are available, a disagreeing team outperforms any like-minded team in terms of average output and team members' welfare.</description>

      <title>The Root of Revenue Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setup of selling one or more goods, various papers have shown, in various forms and for various purposes, that a small change in the distribution of a buyer's valuations may cause only a small change in the possible revenue that can be extracted. We prove a simple, clean, convenient, and general statement to this effect: let $X$ and $Y$ be random valuations on $k$ additive goods, and let $W(X,Y)$ be the Wasserstein (or "earth mover's") distance between them; then $$\left\vert \sqrt{Rev(X)}-\sqrt{Rev(Y)}\right\vert \le \sqrt{W(X,Y)}.$$ This further implies that a simple explicit modification of any optimal mechanism for $X$, namely, "uniform discounting," is guaranteed to be almost optimal for any $Y$ that is close to $X$ in the Wasserstein distance.</description>
