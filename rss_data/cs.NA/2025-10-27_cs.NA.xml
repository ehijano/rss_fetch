      <title>Graph Neural Regularizers for PDE Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), where the target coefficients of the forward operator are recovered through an iterative regularization scheme that alternates between FEM-based inversion and learned graph neural regularization. The forward problem is numerically solved using the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization-based invariant-domain-preserving limiters in solving gas dynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce effective splitting methods for implementing optimization-based limiters to enforce the invariant domain in gas dynamics in high order accurate numerical schemes. The key ingredients include an easy and efficient explicit formulation of the projection onto the invariant domain set, and also proper applications of the classical Douglas-Rachford splitting and its more recent extension Davis-Yin splitting. Such an optimization-based approach can be applied to many numerical schemes to construct high order accurate, globally conservative, and invariant-domain-preserving schemes for compressible flow equations. As a demonstration, we apply it to high order discontinuous Galerkin schemes and test it on demanding benchmarks to validate the robustness and performance of both $\ell^1$-norm minimization limiter and $\ell^2$-norm minimization limiter.</description>

      <title>On the recent advances of spectral analysis for systems arising from fully-implicit RK methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with two groups of spectral analysis results for matrices arising in fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods used for linear time-dependent partial differential equations. These were applied for different formulations of the same problem and used different tools to arrive at results that do not immediately coincide. We show the equivalence of the results as well as the equivalence of the approaches, unifying the two directions.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Estimates of One-Step Numerical Approximations for Superlinear SODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first-order convergence rate for the ergodic error of numerical approximations to a class of stochastic ODEs (SODEs) with superlinear coefficients and multiplicative noise. By leveraging the generator approach to the Stein method, we derive a general error representation formula for one-step numerical schemes. Under suitable dissipativity and smoothness conditions, we prove that the error between the accurate invariant measure $\pi$ and the numerical invariant measure $\pi_\tau$ is of order $\mathscr{O}(\tau)$, which is sharp. Our framework applies to several recently studied schemes, including the tamed Euler, projected Euler, and backward Euler methods.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Spectral Generalized Finite Element Methods for Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations. The method builds local approximations on overlapping subdomains as the sum of a local source solution and a correction from an optimal spectral coarse space, which is obtained from a generalized eigenproblem. The global solution is then assembled via a partition of unity. We prove nearly exponential decay of the approximation error for second-order elliptic problems discretized with a weighted symmetric interior-penalty DG scheme.</description>

      <title>A Variational Framework for the Algorithmic Complexity of PDE Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for modeling physical phenomena, yet most PDEs of practical interest cannot be solved analytically and require numerical approximations. The feasibility of such numerical methods, however, is ultimately constrained by the limitations of existing computation models. Since digital computers constitute the primary physical realizations of numerical computation, and Turing machines define their theoretical limits, the question of Turing computability of PDE solutions arises as a problem of fundamental theoretical significance. The Turing computability of PDE solutions provides a rigorous framework to distinguish equations that are, in principle, algorithmically solvable from those that inherently encode undecidable or non-computable behavior. Once computability is established, complexity theory extends the analysis by quantifying the computational resources required to approximate the corresponding PDE solutions. In this work, we present a novel framework based on least-squares variational formulations and their associated gradient flows to study the computability and complexity of PDE solutions from an optimization perspective. Our approach enables the approximation of PDE solution operators via discrete gradient flows, linking structural properties of the PDE, such as coercivity, ellipticity, and convexity, to the inherent complexity of their solutions. This framework characterizes both regimes where PDEs admit effective numerical solvers in polynomial-time and those exhibiting complexity blowup, where the input data possess polynomial-time complexity, yet the solution itself scales super-polynomially.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a fully discrete Fourier spectral Galerkin (FSG) method for the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (fZK) equation posed on a two-dimensional periodic domain. The equation generalizes the classical ZK model to incorporate nonlocal dispersion through a fractional Laplacian of order $\alpha \in [1,2]$. We first propose a semi-discrete FSG scheme in space that preserves the discrete analogs of mass, momentum, and energy. The existence and uniqueness of semi-discrete solutions are established. Using compactness arguments, we prove the uniform convergence of the semi-discrete approximations to the unique solution of the fZK equation for the periodic initial data in $H^{1+\alpha}_{\mathrm{per}}(\Omega)$. The method achieves spectral convergence of order $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r})$ for initial data in $H^r_{\mathrm{per}}$ with $r \geq \alpha+1$, and exponential convergence for analytic solutions utilizing a modified projection. An efficient integrating-factor Runge-Kutta time discretization is designed to handle the stiff fractional term, and an error analysis is presented. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various fractional orders.</description>

      <title>Exponential integrators for parabolic problems with non-homogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential Runge-Kutta methods are a well-established tool for the numerical integration of parabolic evolution equations. However, these schemes are typically developed under the assumption of homogeneous boundary conditions. In this paper, we extend classical convergence results to the case of non-homogeneous boundary conditions. Since non-homogeneous boundary conditions typically cause order reduction, we introduce a correction strategy based on smooth extensions of the boundary data. This results in a reformulation as a homogeneous problem with modified source term, to which standard exponential integrators can be applied. For linear problems, we prove that the corrected schemes recover the expected convergence order, and hat higher orders can be attained with suitable quadrature rules, reaching order $2s$ for s-stage Gauss collocation methods. For semilinear problems, our approach preserves the convergence orders guaranteed by exponential Runge-Kutta methods satisfying the corresponding stiff order conditions. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Matrix- and tensor-oriented numerical schemes for the evolutionary space-fractional complex Ginzburg--Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose matrix- and tensor-oriented methods for the numerical solution of the multidimensional evolutionary space-fractional complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. After a suitable spatial semidiscretization, the resulting system of ordinary differential equations is time integrated with stiff-resistant schemes. The needed actions of special matrix functions (e.g., inverse, exponential, and the so-called $\varphi$-functions) are efficiently computed in a direct way by exploiting the underlying tensor structure of the task and taking advantage of high performance BLAS and parallelizable pointwise operations. Several numerical experiments in 2D and 3D, where we apply the proposed technique in the context of linearly-implicit and exponential-type schemes, show the reliability and superiority of the approach against the state-of-the-art, allowing to obtain speedups which range from one to two orders of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that in our context a single GPU can be effectively exploited to boost the computations both on consumer- and professional-level hardware.</description>

      <title>Macro-element Refinement schemes for THB-Splines: Applications to B\'ezier Projection and Structure-Preserving Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive refinement strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) using Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). The proposed strategy enhances locally-refined meshes for specific applications, simplifying implementation. We focus on two key applications: an $L^2$-stable local projector for THB-splines via B\'ezier projection [Dijkstra and Toshniwal (2023)], and structure-preserving discretizations using THB-splines [Evans et al. (2020), Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024)]. Previous methods required mesh modifications to retain crucial properties like local linear independence and the exactness of discrete de Rham complexes. Our approach introduces a macro-element-based refinement technique, refining $\vec{q} = q_1\times\cdots\times q_n$ blocks of elements, termed $\vec{q}$-boxes, where the block size $\vec{q}$ is determined by the spline degree and application. For the B\'ezier projection, we refine $\vec{p}$-boxes (i.e., $\vec{q} = \vec{p}$), ensuring THB-splines are locally linearly independent in these boxes, which enables a straightforward extension of the B\'ezier projection algorithm, greatly improving upon Dijkstra and Toshniwal (2023). For structure-preserving discretizations, we refine $(\vec{p+1})$-boxes (i.e., $\vec{q} = \vec{p}+\vec{1}$), demonstrating that this choice meets the sufficient conditions for ensuring the exactness of the THB-spline de Rham complex, as outlined by Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024), in any dimension. This critical aspect allows for adaptive simulations without additional mesh modifications. The effectiveness of our framework is supported by theoretical proofs and numerical experiments, including optimal convergence for adaptive approximation and simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>The temporal domain derivative in inverse acoustic obstacle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes and analyzes the domain derivative for a time-dependent acoustic scattering problem. We study the nonlinear operator that maps a sound-soft scattering object to the solution of the time-dependent wave equation evaluated at a finite number of points away from the obstacle. The Fr\'echet derivative of this operator with respect to variations of the scatterer coincides with point evaluations of the temporal domain derivative. The latter is the solution to another time-dependent scattering problem, for which a well-posedness result is shown under sufficient temporal regularity of the incoming wave. Applying convolution quadrature to this scattering problem gives a stable and provably convergent semi-discretization in time, provided that the incoming wave is sufficient regular. Using the discrete domain derivative in a Gauss--Newton method, we describe an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the boundary of an unknown scattering object from time domain measurements in a few points away from the boundary. Numerical examples for the acoustic wave equation in two dimensions demonstrate the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Sparse Tensor Products of B-spline Approximation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and analyzes B-spline approximation spaces defined on general geometric domains obtained through a mapping from a parameter domain. These spaces are constructed as sparse-grid tensor products of univariate spaces in the parameter domain and are mapped to the physical domain via a geometric parametrization. Both the univariate approximation spaces and the geometric mapping are built using maximally smooth B-splines. We construct two such spaces, employing either the sparse-grid combination technique or the hierarchical subspace decomposition of sparse-grid tensor products, and we prove their mathematical equivalence. Furthermore, we derive approximation error estimates and inverse inequalities that highlight the advantages of sparse-grid tensor products. Specifically, under suitable regularity assumptions on the solution, these spaces achieve the same approximation order as standard tensor product spaces while using significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Additionally, our estimates indicate that, in the case of non-tensor-product domains, stronger regularity assumptions on the solution -- particularly concerning isotropic (non-mixed) derivatives -- are required to achieve optimal convergence rates compared to sparse-grid methods defined on tensor-product domains.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Trace FEM for Surface Cahn--Hilliard Equations: Analysis and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the analysis and numerical assessment of a computational method for solving the Cahn--Hilliard equation defined on a surface. The proposed approach combines the stabilized trace finite element method for spatial discretization with an implicit--explicit scheme for temporal discretization. The method belongs to a class of unfitted finite element methods that use a fixed background mesh and a level-set function for implicit surface representation. We establish the numerical stability of the discrete problem by showing a suitable energy dissipation law for it. We further derive optimal-order error estimates assuming simplicial background meshes and finite element spaces of order $m \geq 1$. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on several two-dimensional closed surfaces, confirming the theoretical results and illustrating the robustness and convergence properties of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Interpolative separable density fitting on adaptive real space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm, the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods. Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Pty-Chi: A PyTorch-based modern ptychographic data analysis package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography has become an indispensable tool for high-resolution, non-destructive imaging using coherent light sources. The processing of ptychographic data critically depends on robust, efficient, and flexible computational reconstruction software. We introduce Pty-Chi, an open-source ptychographic reconstruction package built on PyTorch that unifies state-of-the-art analytical algorithms with automatic differentiation methods. Pty-Chi provides a comprehensive suite of reconstruction algorithms while supporting advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe relaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch as the computational backend ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization, and seamless access to modern optimizers. An object-oriented, modular design makes Pty-Chi highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging models, integrate machine learning approaches, or build entirely new workflows on top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through challenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and unstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility. With community-driven development and open contribution, Pty-Chi offers a modern, maintainable platform for advancing computational ptychography and for enabling innovative imaging algorithms at synchrotron facilities and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard scheme for solving high-dimensional drift control problems with state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to the dynamic control of queueing networks, we develop a simulation-based scheme, the so-called multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation, for solving high-dimensional drift control problems whose states are constrained to stay within the nonnegative orthant, over a finite time horizon. We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate the value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to within a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows at most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\varepsilon$. To illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments for a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem of parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is computationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable Symmetric Stress Elements on the Barycentric Refinement in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybridizable \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conforming finite elements for symmetric tensors on simplices with barycentric refinement are developed in this work for arbitrary dimensions and any polynomial order. By employing barycentric refinement and an intrinsic tangential-normal (\(t\)-\(n\)) decomposition, novel basis functions are constructed to redistribute degrees of freedom while preserving \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conformity and symmetry, and ensuring inf-sup stability. These hybridizable elements enhance computational flexibility and efficiency, with applications to mixed finite element methods for linear elasticity.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitly computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach can significantly reduce computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy-momentum preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as geometrically nonlinear elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The integration strategy preserves energy and angular momentum exactly. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite deformations. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the leapfrog scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

      <title>MAGNET: an open-source library for mesh agglomeration by Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MAGNET, an open-source Python library designed for mesh agglomeration in both two- and three-dimensions, based on employing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a variety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms such as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric computation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure and primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology that capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE convolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et al. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates reinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for predicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial is provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the training of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh agglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability across various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced models is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the proposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and computational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's interface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library implementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the numerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger PDE systems is the onset of instabilities when solved numerically. Efforts towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Bi-degree $(d,d)$ Spline Spaces with the Highest Order of Smoothness over Hierarchical T-Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dimension of the spline space of di-degree $(d,d)$ with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical T-mesh $\mathscr T$ using the smoothing cofactor-conformality method. Firstly, we obtain a dimensional formula for the conformality vector space over a tensor product T-connected component. Then, we prove that the dimension of the conformality vector space over a T-connected component of a hierarchical T-mesh under the tensor product subdivision can be calculated in a recursive manner. Combining these two aspects, we obtain a dimensional formula for the bi-degree $(d,d)$ spline space with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical T-mesh $\mathscr T$ with mild assumption. Additionally, we provide a strategy to modify an arbitrary hierarchical T-mesh such that the dimension of the bi-degree $(d,d)$ spline space is stable over the modified hierarchical T-mesh. Finally, we prove that the dimension of the spline space over such a hierarchical T-mesh is the same as that of a lower-degree spline space over its CVR graph. Thus, the proposed solution can pave the way for the subsequent construction of basis functions for spline space over such a hierarchical T-mesh.</description>

      <title>Spectral element methods for boundary-value problems of functional differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove convergence of the spectral element method for piecewise polynomial collocation applied to periodic boundary value problems for functional differential equations. In particular, we prove that the numerical collocation solution approximates the true solution with accuracy of order $\mathrm{e}^{-\eta m}$ for some $\eta&gt;0$ and increasing degree $m$ of the polynomials for a case that is common in applications: differential equations where the right-hand side depends on a finite number of delayed arguments with parametric delays and real analytic coefficients. For state-dependent delays the spectral element method also converges under mild regularity assumptions, but the geometric convergence of the collocation solution depends on the properties of the true solution, which may in general not be real analytic even for analytic coefficients. However, in those cases the convergence rate is still higher than all finite orders.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Sobolev Gradient flows for the rotating Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of rotating Bose--Einstein condensates, formulated as the minimization of the Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional under a mass conservation constraint. To solve this problem, we consider three Sobolev gradient flow schemes: the $H_0^1$ scheme, the $a_0$ scheme, and the $a_u$ scheme. Convergence of these schemes in the non-rotating case was established by Chen et al., and the rotating $a_u$ scheme was analyzed in Henning et al. In this work, we prove the global convergence of the $H_0^1$ and $a_0$ schemes in the rotating case, and establish local linear convergence for all three schemes near the ground state. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Bean: A Language for Backward Error Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward error analysis offers a method for assessing the quality of numerical programs in the presence of floating-point rounding errors. However, techniques from the numerical analysis literature for quantifying backward error require substantial human effort, and there are currently no tools or automated methods for statically deriving sound backward error bounds. To address this gap, we propose Bean, a typed first-order programming language designed to express quantitative bounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. We prove the soundness of our system using a novel categorical semantics, where every Bean program denotes a triple of related transformations that together satisfy a backward error guarantee.
  To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated backward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from numerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error bounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype implementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically. Our evaluation shows that these inferred bounds match worst-case theoretical relative backward error bounds from the literature, underscoring Bean's utility in validating a key property of numerical programs: numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>
