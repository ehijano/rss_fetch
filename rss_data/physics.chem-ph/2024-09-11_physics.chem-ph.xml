      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of MPS representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic characterization of the ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) binary system for the development of models for CCS processes: Accurate experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data and virial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our study on ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) mixtures, this work reports new experimental($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data for two oxygen-rich mixtures with mole fractions $x$($O_{2}$) = (0.50 and 0.75) mol/mol, in the temperature range $T$ = (250-375) K and pressure range $p$ = (0.5-20) MPa, using a single-sinker densimeter. Experimental density data were compared to two well-established equation-of-state models: EOS-CG and GERG-2008. In the $p$, $T$-range investigated, the EOS-CG gave a better reproduction for the equimolar mixture $x$($O_{2}$) = 0.5, whereas the GERG-2008 performed significantly better for the oxygen-rich mixture $x$($O_{2}$) = 0.75. The EOS-CG generally overestimates the density, while the GERG-2008 underestimates it. This complete set of new experimental data, together with previous measurements, is used to calculate the virial coefficients $B$($T$, $x$) and $C$($T$, $x$), as well as the second interaction virial coefficient $B_{12}$($T$) for the ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) system.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity of Metastable Ionic Liquid [$C_{2}mim$][$CH_{3}SO_{3}$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic liquids have been suggested as new engineering fluids, namely in the area of heat transfer, as alternatives to current biphenyl and diphenyl oxide, alkylated aromatics and dimethyl polysiloxane oils, which degrade above 200 {\deg}C and pose some environmental problems. Recently, we have proposed 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate, [$C_{2}mim$][$CH_{3}SO_{3}$], as a new heat transfer fluid, because of its thermophysical and toxicological properties. However, there are some interesting points raised in this work, namely the possibility of the existence of liquid metastability below the melting point (303 K) or second order-disorder transitions ($\lambda$-type) before reaching the calorimetric freezing point. This paper analyses in more detail this zone of the phase diagram of the pure fluid, by reporting accurate thermal-conductivity measurements between 278 and 355 K with an estimated uncertainty of 2% at a 95% confidence level. A new value of the melting temperature is also reported, $T_{melt}$ = 307.8 $\pm$ 1 K. Results obtained support liquid metastability behaviour in the solid-phase region and permit the use of this ionic liquid at a heat transfer fluid at temperatures below its melting point. Thermal conductivity models based on Bridgman theory and estimation formulas were also used in this work, failing to predict the experimental data within its uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Orientational and steric effects in linear alkanoates + N-Alkane mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_u$COO(CH$_3$)$_v$CH$_3$ + n-alkane mixtures have been investigated on the basis of an experimental database containing effective dipole moments of esters, and excess molar functions of the systems: enthalpies ($H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), volumes ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), isobaric heat capacities ($C_{p\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and isochoric internal energies ($U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and by means of the application of the Flory model and the Kirkwood-Buff formalism. The situation of the mixtures within the $G_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ (excess molar Gibbs energy) vs. $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ diagram has also been briefly considered. Results indicate that dispersive interactions are dominant and that steric effects can explain some differences between solutions containing heptane and isomeric esters. Proximity and orientational effects are also discussed in diester + hexane mixtures. In the case of systems with a given alkane and different isomeric polar compounds, orientational effects become weaker in the order: n-alkanone &gt; dialkyl carbonate &gt; n-alkanoate. Results from the Kirkwood-Buff formalism indicate that the number of ester-ester interactions decreases in systems with alkyl ethanoates when the alkyl size increases and that preferential solvation between polar molecules decreases as follows: dialkyl carbonate &gt; n-alkanone &gt; n-alkanoate.</description>

      <title>Spectral Map for Slow Collective Variables, Markovian Dynamics, and Transition State Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of complex molecular systems is a fundamental problem in physical chemistry. To describe the long-time dynamics of such systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs, effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22, 5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion. We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein folding.</description>

      <title>Learning local and semi-local density functionals from exact exchange-correlation potentials and energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding accurate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals remains the defining challenge in density functional theory (DFT). Despite 40 years of active development, the desired chemical accuracy is still elusive with existing functionals. We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functionals by utilizing the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN) based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies, densities, atomization energies, and barrier heights for hundreds of molecules outside the training set. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA, highlighting the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals. We expect this approach to pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate and sophisticated XC functionals.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules in Modified-Morse Potential using Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. The Modified-Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For \ce{H2}, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Syntax-Guided Procedural Synthesis of Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the interplay between steel rebar corrosion rate and corrosion-induced cracking of reinforced concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated impressed current testing is the most common experimental method for assessing the susceptibility to corrosion-induced cracking, the most prominent challenge to the durability of reinforced concrete structures. Although it is well known that accelerated impressed current tests lead to slower propagation of cracks (with respect to corrosion penetration) than in natural conditions, which results in overestimations of the delamination/spalling time, the origins of this phenomenon have puzzled researchers for more than a quarter of a century. In view of recent experimental findings, it is postulated that the phenomenon can be attributed to the variability of rust composition and density, specifically to the variable ratio of the mass fractions of iron oxide and iron hydroxide-oxide, which is affected by the magnitude of the applied corrosion current density. Based on this hypothesis, a corrosion-induced cracking model for virtual impressed-current testing is presented. The simulation results obtained with the proposed model are validated against experimental data, showing good agreement. Importantly, the model can predict corrosion-induced cracking under natural conditions and thus allows for the calculation of a newly proposed crack width slope correction factor, which extrapolates the surface crack width measured during accelerated impressed current tests to corrosion in natural conditions.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature and crack-tip speed on crack propagation in elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the influence of temperature and the crack-tip velocity of the bond breaking at the crack tip in rubber-like materials. The bond breaking is considered as a stress-aided thermally activated process and result in an effective crack propagation energy which increases strongly with decreasing temperature or increasing crack-tip speed. This effect is particular important for adhesive (interfacial) crack propagation but less important for cohesive crack propagation owing to the much larger bond-breaking energies in the latter case. For adhesive cracks the theory results are consistent with adhesion measurements for silicone (PDMS) rubber in contact with silica glass surfaces. For cohesive cracks the theory agree well with experimental results PDMS films chemically bound to silinized glass.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (also known as freeze drying) is a process that is commonly used to increase the stability of drug products, e.g., mRNA vaccines, in pharmaceutical manufacturing. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shift the pharmaceutical industry towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article proposes the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which includes freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The state-of-the-art lyophilization technology is considered, in which vials are suspended and moved continuously through the process. The model can describe the evolution of several critical process parameters, namely the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire lyophilization process. The model is also demonstrated for several applications related to process design and optimization. Ultimately, the framework and results presented in this work can serve as a solid foundation to guide the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>An Update to Isomers of Rydberg Excitations in Argon Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of Diabatisation is reported in the excited argon isomers using the Diatomic-In-Molecules (DIM) method. In previous work using DIM, the lowest energy isomers of Ar$_N^*$ were shown as Ar$_3^*-$Ar$_{N-3}$, however, using the Hole-Particle-Psedopotential (HPP) method, it was shown that the excitation is localised over dimer not trimer; Ar$_2^*-$Ar$_{N-2}$. In this work we improve the DIM calculations by including previously ignored strongly avoided crossing between 3p4s and 3p4p $^{1,3}\Sigma$ states.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its internal structure is calculable to high precision from first principles. This allows tests of theoretical models and the determination of fundamental constants. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges. Standard control methods such as laser cooling, fluorescence detection and optical pumping are not applicable to $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ due to the very long lifetimes of its excited rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by using Quantum Logic Spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate full quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecule by co-trapping it with an atomic 'helper' ion and performing quantum operations between the two ions. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control and non-destructive readout, which we use to perform high-resolution microwave spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains, while offering techniques which are transferable to other molecular ions.</description>

Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum-Chandler-Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [K. Lum et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with Matchgate shadows</title>

Abstract: Solving the electronic structure problem of molecules and solids to high accuracy is a major challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15338</link>

Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <title>A transition state resonance radically reshapes angular distributions of the F + H2 -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction in the 62-101 meV energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>
