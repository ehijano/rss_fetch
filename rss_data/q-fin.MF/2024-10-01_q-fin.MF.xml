      <title>Time-Consistent Portfolio Selection for Rank-Dependent Utilities in an Incomplete Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the portfolio selection problem for an agent with rank-dependent utility in an incomplete financial market. For a constant-coefficient market and CRRA utilities, we characterize the deterministic strict equilibrium strategies. In the case of time-invariant probability weighting function, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the deterministic strict equilibrium strategy. The unique non-zero equilibrium, if exists, can be determined by solving an autonomous ODE. In the case of time-variant probability weighting functions, we observe that there may be infinitely many non-zero deterministic strict equilibrium strategies, which are derived from the positive solutions to a nonlinear singular ODE. By specifying the maximal solution to the singular ODE, we are able to identify all the positive solutions. In addition, we address the issue of selecting an optimal strategy from the numerous equilibrium strategies available.</description>

      <title>Pricing and Hedging Strategies for Cross-Currency Equity Protection Swaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the pricing and hedging strategies for an innovative insurance product called the equity protection swap(EPS). Notably, we focus on the application of EPSs involving cross-currency reference portfolios, reflecting the realities of investor asset diversification across different economies. The research examines key considerations regarding exchange rate fluctuations, pricing and hedging frameworks, in order to satisfy dynamic requirements from EPS buyers. We differentiate between two hedging paradigms: one where domestic and foreign equities are treated separately using two EPS products and another that integrates total returns across currencies. Through detailed analysis, we propose various hedging strategies with consideration of different types of returns - nominal, effective, and quanto - for EPS products in both separate and aggregated contexts. The aggregated hedging portfolios contain basket options with cross-currency underlying asset, which only exists in the OTC market, thus we further consider a superhedging strategy using single asset European options for aggregated returns. A numerical study assesses hedging costs and performance metrics associated with these hedging strategies, illuminating practical implications for EPS providers and investors engaged in international markets. We further employ Monte Carlo simulations for the basket option pricing, together with two other approximation methods - geometric averaging and moment matching. This work contributes to enhancing fair pricing mechanisms and risk management strategies in the evolving landscape of cross-currency financial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Signal inference in financial stock return correlations through phase-ordering kinetics in the quenched regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial stock return correlations have been analyzed through the lens of random matrix theory to differentiate the underlying signal from spurious correlations. The continuous spectrum of the eigenvalue distribution derived from the stock return correlation matrix typically aligns with a rescaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution, indicating no detectable signal. In this study, we introduce a stochastic field theory model to establish a detection threshold for signals present in the limit where the eigenvalues are within the continuous spectrum, which itself closely resembles that of a random matrix where standard methods such as principal component analysis fail to infer a signal. We then apply our method to Standard &amp; Poor's 500 financial stocks' return correlations, detecting the presence of a signal in the largest eigenvalues within the continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Axioms for Automated Market Makers: A Mathematical Framework in FinTech and Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within this work we consider an axiomatic framework for Automated Market Makers (AMMs). AMMs are smart contracts that set prices for swaps on a pool of assets. By imposing reasonable axioms on the underlying utility function, we are able to characterize the properties of the swap size of the assets and of the resulting pricing oracle. In providing these general axioms, we define a novel measure of price impacts that can be used to quantify those costs between different AMM constructions. We have analyzed many existing AMMs and shown that the vast majority of them satisfy our axioms. We have also considered the question of fees and divergence loss. In doing so, we have proposed a new fee structure so as to make the AMM indifferent to transaction splitting. Finally, we have proposed a novel AMM that has nice analytical properties and provides a large range over which there is no divergence loss.</description>
