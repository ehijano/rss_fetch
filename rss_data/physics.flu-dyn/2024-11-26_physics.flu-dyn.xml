      <title>Benjamin-Feir instability of wave packets at interface of liquid half-space and layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of internal waves in a hydrodynamic system comprising a solid bottom and an upper half-space is investigated. The study is conducted within the framework of a nonlinear low-dimensional model incorporating surface tension on an interface using the method of multi-scale expansions. The evolution equation of the envelope of the wave packet takes the form of the Schrodinger equation. Conditions for the Benjamin-Feir stability of the solution of the evolution equation are identified for various physical and geometrical characteristics of the system. An estimation of the parameter range in which the instability occurs is performed. Significant influence on the modulational stability of the geometrical characteristics of the system and surface tension is observed in each system for relatively small liquid layer thicknesses and waves with a wavelength comparable to the layer thickness</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian set-up for 4-layer density stratified Euler fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of the Hamiltonian approach to two-dimensional wave motions in heterogeneous fluids proposed by Benjamin, we derive a natural Hamiltonian structure for ideal fluids, density stratified in four homogenous layers, constrained in a channel of fixed total height and infinite lateral length. We derive the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion in the dispersionless long-wave limit, restricting ourselves to the so-called Boussinesq approximation. The existence of special symmetric solutions, which generalize to the four-layer case the ones obtained in the paper for the three-layer case, is examined.</description>

      <title>Generic equations for long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with finite amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the derivation of generic equations describing the long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with decaying effect. We show that in this theory the only restriction to the surface deviation is connected with the stability condition for the waves. Derivation of these generic equations is based on Euler equations for inviscid incompressible fluid and definition of dynamic pressure which leads to correct dispersion equation for gravity waves. These derived generic equations for velocity of fluid and the surface deviation describe the propagation of long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with finite amplitude. We also have found the necessary and sufficient conditions for generic equations with dissipation of energy or decaying effect. The developed approach can significantly improve the accuracy of theory for long gravity waves in incompressible fluid. We also have found the quasi-periodic and solitary wave solutions for generic equations with decaying effect.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Nature's Cost: Exploring Data-Free Physics-Informed Neural Network Solvers for Fluid Mechanics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for fluid dynamic simulations by harnessing the capabilities of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) guided by the newly unveiled principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). In a PINN formulation, the physics problem is converted into a minimization problem (typically least squares). The PMPG asserts that for incompressible flows, the total magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain must be minimum at every time instant, turning fluid mechanics into minimization problems, making it an excellent choice for PINNs formulation. Following the PMPG, the proposed PINN formulation seeks to construct a neural network for the flow field that minimizes Nature's cost function for incompressible flows in contrast to traditional PINNs that minimize the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations. This technique eliminates the need to train a separate pressure model, thereby reducing training time and computational costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a case study of inviscid flow around a cylinder, showing its ability to capture the underlying physics, while reducing computational cost and training time. The proposed approach outperforms the traditional PINNs approach in terms of Root Mean Square Error, training time, convergence rate, and compliance with physical metrics. While demonstrated on a simple geometry, the methodology is extendable to more complex flow fields (e.g., Three-Dimensional, unsteady, viscous flows) within the incompressible realm, which is the region of applicability of the PMPG.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy in Oil Displacement Mechanisms at the Equivalent Interfacial Tensions: Differentiating Contributions from Surfactant and Nanoparticles on Interfacial Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines discrepancies in oil displacement mechanisms at equivalent interfacial tensions, focusing on the distinct contributions of surfactants and nanoparticles. It was hypothesized that similar interfacial activities would result in consistent displacement outcomes, while differences would reflect unique interfacial behaviors. Micromodel experiments revealed that at high interfacial tension (~20 mN/m), surfactants outperformed nanofluids in efficiency and ultimate oil recovery by reinforcing capillary forces. Conversely, nanofluids showed limited ability to modify interfacial forces. At lower interfacial tensions (6.5 mN/m for surfactants, 15.6 mN/m for nanofluids), both systems displayed similar displacement efficiencies and fingering patterns, driven by distinct mechanisms: capillary instability for surfactants and expansive layer flow for nanofluids. These findings challenge the assumption that nanofluids rely primarily on interfacial tension reduction for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and highlight the need to refine our understanding of nanoparticle interfacial activities. Future studies should extend these insights to core-scale experiments for a more comprehensive evaluation of two-phase flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>From wicking to anti-wicking: A universal framework for capillary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of capillary rise under different geometric and fluid conditions have the common signatures of rapid rise followed by an equilibrium state that describe the underlying competing forces. We present a new interpretation of capillary dynamics using a linear damped system where modulation of damping and forcing characteristics are achieved using axisymmetric channels with sinusoidal variation in radius. The complete axisymmetric design space ranging from hydrophilic channels that enable spontaneous imbibition to hydrophobic channels, that required external pressure mechanisms is modeled and the force dynamics is split into simultaneous damping and forcing characteristics. We introduce the product of damping and forcing terms as the new parameter that effectively characterizes rise dynamics across various geometric and flow conditions, encompassing both flow-enhancing and flow-inhibiting scenarios. The monotonic nature of this parameter enables the development of a stochastic optimization method that can determine optimal channel geometries for controlled capillary rise.</description>

      <title>Excitation and stability of nonlinear compressible G\"ortler vortices and streaks induced by free-stream vortical disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generation, nonlinear development and secondary instability of unsteady G\"ortler vortices and streaks in compressible boundary layers exposed to free-stream vortical disturbances and evolving over concave, flat and convex walls. The formation and evolution of the disturbances are governed by the compressible nonlinear boundary-region equations, supplemented by initial and boundary conditions that characterise the impact of the free-stream disturbances on the boundary layer. Computations are performed for parameters typical of flows over high-pressure turbine blades, where the G\"ortler number, a measure of the curvature effects, and the disturbance Reynolds number, a measure of the nonlinear effects, are order-one quantities. At moderate intensities of the free-stream disturbances, increasing the G\"ortler number renders the boundary layer more unstable, while increasing the Mach number or the frequency stabilises the flow. As the free-stream disturbances become more intense, vortices over concave surfaces no longer develop into the characteristic mushroom-shaped structures, while the flow over convex surfaces is destabilised. An occurrence map identifies G\"ortler vortices or streaks for different levels of free-stream disturbances and G\"ortler numbers. Our calculations capture well the experimental measurements of the enhanced skin friction and wall-heat transfer over turbine-blade pressure surfaces. The time-averaged wall-heat transfer modulations, termed hot fingers, are elongated in the streamwise direction and their spanwise wavelength is half of the characteristic wavelength of the free-stream disturbances. Nonlinearly saturated disturbances are unstable to secondary high-frequencymodes, whose growth rate increases with the G\"ortler number. A new varicose even mode is reported, which may promote transition to turbulence at the stem of nonlinear streaks.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Heat Transfer Effects on Bubble Growth During Flow Boiling Heat Transfer in Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow boiling in microchannel heat sinks is an efficient way to dissipate high heat flux by utilizing the large surface-to-volume ratio and high latent heat. Previous studies of boiling heat transfer in microchannels mainly consider the fluid flow in channels only, but often neglect the conjugate effects of the heat conduction in the solid wall, which becomes important for microchannels because of the comparable sizes of the flow channel and the solid wall. In the present study, the effects of conjugate heat transfer on bubble growth during flow boiling in microchannels are examined by numerical simulation. The results indicate that the bubble growth is non-uniform for different bottom wall thicknesses or different solid materials even with the same heat flux at the wall. As the bottom wall thickness increases, the bubble growth rate increases because of the heat conduction in the solid wall along the channel direction. The increased bubble size also increases the perturbation to the flow field, and enhances the thermal convection between the fluid and the wall. For different solid materials, the high-thermal-diffusivity material possesses a higher heat transfer performance because of the quick diffusion of thermal energy from the heat source to the solid-fluid interface.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow of incompressible liquid through a conical diffuser with partial slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative form of the general solution of the linearized stationary Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in spherical coordinates is obtained by the vector potential method. A previously published solution to this problem, dating back to the paper by Sampson, is given in terms of a stream function, which leads to formulas that are difficult to apply in practice. The presented form of solution is applied to the problem of liquid flowing through a conical diffuser under a partial slip boundary condition for a certain slip length lambda. Recurrent relations are obtained that allow us to determine the velocity, pressure and stream function. The solution is analyzed in the first order of decomposition with respect to a small dimensionless parameter (lambda divided by r). It is shown that the sliding of the liquid over the surface of the cone leads to a vorticity of the flow. At zero slip length, we obtain the well-known solution to the problem of a diffuser with no-slip boundary condition that correspond to strictly radial streamlines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating realistic droplet simulations and animations has long been a formidable challenge for researchers and developers due to the inherent complexity of fluid dynamics. Achieving lifelike droplet splash simulations while managing computational resources has often resulted in sacrifices compromising the realism of visualizations. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past two decades, driven by advancements in particle-based methods such as Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). These methods have enabled the simulation of droplet splash behaviour with increasing accuracy and reduced computational complexity. Integrating features like surface tensions, fluid incompressibility, and liquid-wall interactions has further enhanced the realism of the simulations. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and methodologies employed in droplet simulations and how they have evolved over time. Accurate droplet interaction visualization holds immense potential across diverse applications, including gaming, animation, medical simulations, and engineering scenarios like 3D printing simulations.</description>

      <title>Can flocking aid the path planning of microswimmers in turbulent flows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that flocking of microswimmers in a turbulent flow can enhance the efficacy of reinforcement-learning-based path-planning of microswimmers in turbulent flows. In particular, we develop a machine-learning strategy that incorporates Vicsek-model-type flocking in microswimmer assemblies in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow in two dimensions (2D). We build on the adversarial-reinforcement-learning of Ref.~\cite{alageshan2020machine} for non-interacting microswimmers in turbulent flows. Such microswimmers aim to move optimally from an initial position to a target. We demonstrate that our flocking-aided version of the adversarial-reinforcement-learning strategy of Ref.~\cite{alageshan2020machine} can be superior to earlier microswimmer path-planning strategies.</description>

      <title>PINNs4Drops: Convolutional feature-enhanced physics-informed neural networks for reconstructing two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-phase flow phenomena play a key role in many engineering applications, including hydrogen fuel cells, spray cooling techniques and combustion. Specialized techniques like shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry can reveal gas-liquid interface evolution and internal velocity fields; however, they are largely limited to planar measurements, while flow dynamics are inherently three-dimensional (3D). Deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks provide a powerful approach for volumetric reconstruction based on the experimental data by leveraging spatial structure of images and extracting context-rich features. Building on this foundation, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a complementary and promising alternative integrating prior knowledge in the form of governing equations into the networks training process. This integration enables accurate predictions even with limited data. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we propose a novel convolutional feature-enhanced PINNs framework, designed for the spatio-temporal reconstruction of two-phase flows from color-coded shadowgraphy images. The proposed approach is first validated on synthetic data generated through direct numerical simulation, demonstrating high spatial accuracy in reconstructing the three-dimensional gas-liquid interface, along with the inferred velocity and pressure fields. Subsequently, we apply this method to interface reconstruction for an impinging droplet using planar experimental data, highlighting the practical applicability and significant potential of the proposed approach to real-world fluid dynamics analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal rigid brush for fluid capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel assemblies of slender structures forming brushes are common in our daily life from sweepers to pastry brushes and paintbrushes. This type of porous objects can easily trap liquid in their interstices when removed from a liquid bath. This property is exploited to transport liquids in many applications ranging from painting, dip-coating, brush-coating to the capture of nectar by bees, bats and honeyeaters. Rationalizing the viscous entrainment flow beyond simple scaling laws is complex due to its multiscale structure and the multidirectional flow. Here, we provide an analytical model, together with precision experiments with ideal rigid brushes, to fully characterize the flow through this anisotropic porous medium as it is withdrawn from a liquid bath. We show that the amount of liquid entrained by a brush varies non-monotonically during the withdrawal at low speed, is highly sensitive to the different parameters at play and is very well described by the model without any fitting parameter. Finally, an optimal brush geometry maximizing the amount of liquid captured at a given retraction speed is derived from the model and experimentally validated. These optimal designs open routes towards efficient liquid manipulating devices.</description>

      <title>Vortex shedding and heat transfer from a heated circular cylinder in Bingham plastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study numerically investigates the vortex shedding and heat transfer characteristics of a heated circular cylinder immersed in Bingham plastic fluids.The effects of three parameters, i.e., (i) plastic Reynolds number ($10 \leq Re \leq 180$), (ii) Prandtl number ($1\leq Pr \leq 100$), and (iii) the Bingham number ($0 \leq Bn \leq 10,000$), are evaluated. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations for flow and heat transfer are adopted, along with the incorporation of the Papanastasiou regularization to address the discontinuous-viscosity characteristics of Bingham plastic fluids. To illustrate the impact of fluid yield stress on the flow structure, the study provides comprehensive insights into flow transition, streamlines, shear rate and velocity distributions, the morphology of yielded/unyielded regions, and the drag coefficient ($C_d$). Additionally, the temperature distribution, the local Nusselt number ($\overline{Nu_{local}}$) along the cylinder, and the average Nusselt number on the cylinder ($\overline{Nu}$) are analyzed. The results indicate that the flow transition of Bingham fluids over a circular cylinder is dependent on external disturbances, exhibiting subcritical bifurcation behavior. This leads to abrupt jumps in the $\overline{Cd}$ - $Bn$ curve and the $\overline{Nu}$ - $Bn$ curve near the critical Bingham number $Bn_c$. Furthermore, the heat transfer performance is contingent upon the different distribution of shear strain rate in the boundary layer across various $Bn$ ranges. It is observed that $\overline{Nu}$ and $Bn$ fits well with the Carreau-Yasuda-like non-Newtonian viscosity model. This investigation enhances the understanding of the vortex shedding and heat transfer behaviors in Bingham plastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of a space-time modulated airborne acoustic circulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving strongly nonreciprocal scattering in compact linear acoustic devices is a challenging task. One possible solution is the use of time-modulated resonators, however, their implementation in the realm of audible airborne acoustics is typically hindered by the difficulty to obtain large modulation depth and speeds while managing noise issues. Here, we propose a practical and cost-efficient route to realize simple modulated resonators and observe experimentally the strong nonreciprocal behavior of an acoustic circulator. We propose to modulate the neck cross-section areas of three coupled Helmholtz resonators using rotating circular plates actuated by an electrical motor, and control their phase difference via meshed gears, thereby implementing a modulation scheme with broken time-reversal symmetry that effectively imparts angular momentum to the system. We experimentally demonstrate tunable nonreciprocal behavior with a high nonreciprocal isolation of 34 dB and reflection as low as -9 dB, with insertion losses of 5 dB and parasitic signals below -20 dB. All the experimental results agree well with theoretical and numerical predictions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Flow-induced Motion Energy Harvesting with Coupled Mechanism of Time-varying Stiffness and Passive Turbulence Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ocean contains a substantial amount of energy, and the efficient harvesting of this energy holds significant importance. Drawing inspiration from the biomimicry of octopus tentacles, this study introduces a synergistic mechanism designed to optimize energy harvesting through flowinduced motions, integrating boundary layer modulation via passive turbulence control (PTC) with dynamic system stiffness adjustments via time-varying stiffness (SIN &amp; Trapezoidal patterns). The implementation of PTC facilitates global stability by managing the local instabilities caused by variable stiffness, culminating in a highly effective energy harvesting capability. Our investigations summarize the requisite conditions for peak energy harvesting efficacy, notably within the SIN 80 degrees PTC and Trapezoid/60 degrees PTC arrangements, which have been demonstrated to double the efficiency of energy harvesting with up to 57%, alongside a reduction in initial harvesting frequency and an enhancement in both instantaneous power output and vibration amplitude. Furthermore, an energy transfer characteristic map has been compiled to illustrate the mechanism coupled between boundary layer modulation and time-varying stiffness. This research not only introduces novel perspectives but also stands as a significant stride in the realm of wide band and efficient energy harvesting in the ocean.</description>

      <title>Dataflow Optimized Reconfigurable Acceleration for FEM-based CFD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for analyzing and optimizing fluid flows in a wide range of real-world applications. These simulations involve approximating the solutions of the Navier-Stokes differential equations using numerical methods, which are highly compute- and memory-intensive due to their need for high-precision iterations. In this work, we introduce a high-performance FPGA accelerator specifically designed for numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations. We focus on the Finite Element Method (FEM) due to its ability to accurately model complex geometries and intricate setups typical of real-world applications. Our accelerator is implemented using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) on an AMD Alveo U200 FPGA, leveraging the reconfigurability of FPGAs to offer a flexible and adaptable solution. The proposed solution achieves 7.9x higher performance than optimized Vitis-HLS implementations and 45% lower latency with 3.64x less power compared to a software implementation on a high-end server CPU. This highlights the potential of our approach to solve Navier-Stokes equations more effectively, paving the way for tackling even more challenging CFD simulations in the future.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor instability in binary fluids with miscibility gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel phase field method is proposed to model the continuous transition of binary fluids exhibiting temperature sensitive miscibility gap, from immiscible state to miscible state via partially miscible states. The model is employed to investigate the isothermal single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability for binary fluids as the system temperature is varied. Assuming potential flow and utilizing Boussinesq approximation, we derived the dispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves and the RT instability. The study reveals the early-stage growth characteristics of the interfacial perturbation. Three zones with distinct qualitative behaviour for the growth rate are identified as a function of Atwood number and Weber Number. Subsequently, Boussinesq approximation is relaxed to obtain coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations to perform numerical simulations. The results from the numerical simulations corroborate the findings from the dispersion relation at early-stages. Further investigation of the late-time dynamics for viscous fluid pair reveal the tortuous topology presumed by the interface. The emanation of secondary instability in form of Kelvin-Helmholtz rolls is observed. The formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz rolls is found to be dependent on the system temperature. Finally, we present the effect of the slow nature of diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Path of a pair of deformable bubbles rising initially in line and close to a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that in an unbounded fluid, the inline configuration of a freely rising bubble pair is often unstable with respect to lateral disturbances. This work numerically examines the stability of this configuration in the presence of a nearby vertical wall. The focus is on moderately inertial regimes, where two bubbles rising initially in line typically separate laterally from each other under unbounded conditions. In the presence of the wall, our results indicate that while the path of the bubble pair predominantly separates laterally, the plane of separation largely depends on the wall bubble interaction. This interaction involves a competition between two distinct effects, with the dominance determined by the ratios of buoyancy to viscous and buoyancy to capillary forces, which define the Galilei (Ga) and Bond (Bo) numbers, respectively. When Bo is below a critical Ga-dependent threshold, irrotational effects dominate, initially stabilizing both bubbles near the wall until horizontal separation among them occurs in the wall parallel plane. Conversely, at higher Bo, vortical effects dominate such that both bubbles migrate away from the wall. During the departure, asymmetric interactions cause the wall normal velocities of the two bubbles to differ, leading to horizontal separation in the wall-normal plane. These two separation motions, both newly identified in the present study, are found to result from two distinct mechanisms: one associated with the shear flow generated in the gap separating the wall and the leading bubble, which attracts the trailing bubble toward the wall, and the other linked to vortex shedding from the leading bubble, which promotes the trailing bubble's faster escape from the wall.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives for turbulence modeling. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder. Training data was obtained by means of LES. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate the flow distribution, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence modeling. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they gave the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, is significantly slower at both inference and training time.</description>

      <title>Persistence and bimodality of large-scale turbulent structures across a Rayleigh-Taylor layer: Impact on transport and physical modelling through two-field-conditional correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution functions of field fluctuations of the turbulent mixing layer produced by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) have long been hypothesized to involve bimodal effects. The present work reviews existing quantitative and qualitative evidence in support this conjecture, provides an associated theoretical framework, and measures the corresponding relevant statistical quantities on a simulation of a turbulent RTI at low Atwood number.
  The bimodal behaviour of fluctuations, readily observable close to the edges of the mixing zone, is less obvious within the mixing zone where indirect evidence comes from different sources, here gathered, discussed, and expanded: energy structure of buoyancy-drag equation, visual eduction from simulated RTI, two-fluid conditional analysis of energy balance, bulk non-dimensional turbulent numbers (Stokes, Knudsen, and Reynolds)...
  In order to carry out a bimodal analysis of the statistical quantities, two complementary indicator functions are here defined, the `light, upward moving' and `heavy downward moving' fluid zones. An adapted reconstruction is introduced here, based on the thresholding of a space- and time-filtered field (here the vertical velocity).
  The prescription for the two-structure-field segmentation was applied to a direct numerical simulation of an RTI and the corresponding structure-conditioned averages of the main quantities were obtained (concentrations, momentum, turbulent energies...). Notable features for turbulence understanding and modelling are then observed.
  The measured conditional averages provide the first know reference data for validation and calibration of so-called `two-structure' RANS turbulence models such as Youngs' (2015 Int. J. Heat Fluid Fl. 56, 233--250 and refs therein) and 2SFK (2003 Laser Part.\ Beams 21 (3), 311--315).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat transfer of fluid can be greatly enhanced by natural convection, leading to the famous Nusselt-Rayleigh number scaling that has been a focus of modern fluid dynamics. Our work explores natural convection in an annular domain, where the annular geometry reinforces the large-scale circulation. To understand the heat transfer and flow pattern in this novel geometry, we derive a reduced model from the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations where the equations of flow and heat are transformed to a system of low-order partial differential equations, whose solution preserves the same boundary layer structures seen in the direct numerical simulation. By matching the solutions inside and outside the boundary layer, we recover all the scaling laws observed in the direct numerical simulation, further demonstrating the accuracy of this reduced model. Our results also provide a systematic way of analyzing thermal convection in an annular domain, which brings us one step closer to understanding the origin of large-scale circulation and the mechanism of convective heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Super-Stencils for Turbulence Model Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows remains a challenge due to the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and the limitations of traditional turbulence models. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting standard models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using a Non-Linear Super-Stencil (NLSS). The proposed method introduces a fully connected neural network that learns a mapping from the local mean flow field to a corrective force term, which is added to a standard RANS solver in order to align its solution with high-fidelity data. A procedure is devised to extract training data from reference DNS and large eddy simulations (LES). To reduce the complexity of the non-linear mapping, the dimensionless local flow data is aligned with the local mean velocity, and the local support domain is scaled by the turbulent integral length scale. After being trained on a single periodic hill case, the NLSS-corrected RANS solver is shown to generalize to different periodic hill geometries and different Reynolds numbers, producing significantly more accurate solutions than the uncorrected RANS simulations.</description>

      <title>Drop impact on a heated wet wall: deposition-on-crater regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of a liquid drop with high Reynolds and Weber numbers on a wet solid surface typically results in the emergence, rising, and expansion of a corona-like thin jet. This phenomenon is explained by the propagation of a kinematic discontinuity within the wall film. Conventional theories suggest that the corona-forming liquid jet comprises material from the impacting drop and wall film. In this study, the impact of a drop on a wall film is observed using a high-speed video system. Simultaneously, the distribution of the contact temperature at the substrate surface is measured with a high-speed infrared system. The results reveal that heat transfer predominantly occurs within the thin thermal boundary layers in the drop and substrate. Moreover, our experiments show that under our specific conditions, the drop deposits at the base of the crater while only the wall film produces the corona and splashes. Correspondingly, the secondary drops consist only of the heated material of the wall film. This regime has not been previously reported in the literature. The validated models for the diameter of the cold spot, the characteristic time, and the contact temperature developed in this study can be potentially useful for reliable modeling of spray cooling.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference compatible entropy-conserving schemes for the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis of blood flow within human left ventricle models, with particular emphasis on optimizing simulation conditions to enhance the realism and computational efficiency of heart flow dynamics. The objective is to determine the most effective mesh configurations, flow conditions, and boundary settings necessary for accurately capturing the formation and behavior of the vortex ring, a pivotal element in ventricular flow dynamics. Utilizing a computational fluid mechanics approach, we review the influence of both idealized and patient specific geometries on simulation outcomes. It is imperative to consider the necessity of dynamic wall motion and the precise calibration of inlet and outlet boundary conditions, which must be designed to mimic physiological conditions as accurately as possible. These factors are of paramount importance in achieving a balance between computational resource demands and the fidelity of the simulations, thereby providing valuable insights for future cardiovascular modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Pervaporation-driven electrokinetic energy harvesting using poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrokinetic energy harvesting from evaporation-driven flows in porous materials has recently been the subject of numerous studies, particularly with the development of nanomaterials with high conversion efficiencies. The configuration in which the energy conversion element is located upstream of the element which passively drives the evaporative flow has rarely been studied. However, this configuration offers the possibility of increasing the harvested energy simply by increasing the evaporation surface area and/or the hydraulic resistance of the energy conversion element. In this work, we investigate this configuration with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chips playing the role of {\it artificial leaves} driving a pervaporation-induced flow through a polystyrene colloid plug in a submillimetre tube for the energy conversion. With an appropriate design of the venation of the PDMS leaves, we report the first experimental evidence of electrokinetic energy conversion from pervaporation-induced flows, which increases with the pervaporation area. We also provide new insights by demonstrating that this increase is limited by cavitation within the PDMS leaves, which occurs systematically as soon as the water pressure inside the leaf reaches $P_\text{leaf} \simeq 0$~bar. Whatever the cavitation threshold, this phenomenon imposes an intrinsic limit on this configuration, underlining the need for innovative strategies to improve the harvesting of electrokinetic energy by evaporation.</description>

      <title>High-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver based on Jacobi polynomial expansion for compressible flows on unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Jacobi polynomial expansion, an arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver for compressible flows on unstructured meshes is proposed in the present work. First, we construct orthogonal polynomials for 2D and 3D isoparametric elements using the 1D Jacobi polynomials. We perform modal expansions of the state variables using the orthogonal polynomials, enabling arbitrary high-order spatial discretization of these variables. Subsequently, the discrete governing equations are derived by considering the orthogonality of the Euler equations' residuals and the test functions. On this basis, we develop a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver that supports various element types, including triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra, etc. An improved shock-capturing scheme has been adopted to capture shock discontinuities within the flow field. The variable's gradients at the discontinuous elements are reconstructed by its adjacent elements, and the slope limiter is applied to modify the state variables, smoothing the state variables and enhancing the robustness of the solver. The convergence rates of solvers of different orders have been verified by a benchmark case, and the CPU costs are given to prove that high-precision algorithms have higher computational efficiency under the same error level. Finally, several two- and three-dimensional compressible fluid dynamics problems are studied, compared with literature and experimental results, the effectiveness and accuracy of the solver were verified.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>

      <title>VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) are models that learn operators across different types of PDEs using a few-shot, in-context approach. Although they show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each data point as a single token, and suffer from computational inefficiency when processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing scaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</description>

      <title>Generalizable data-driven turbulence closure modeling on unstructured grids with differentiable physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable physical simulators are proving to be valuable tools for developing data-driven models in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a generic finite element solver to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid scale closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We validate our method for flow over a backwards-facing step and test its performance on novel geometries, demonstrating the ability to generalize to novel geometries without sacrificing stability. Additionally, we show that our GNN-based closure model may be learned in a data-limited scenario by interpreting closure modeling as a solver-constrained optimization. Our end-to-end learning paradigm demonstrates a viable pathway for physically consistent and generalizable data-driven closure modeling across complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning for the control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has found application in numerous use-cases pertaining to flow control. Multi-agent RL (MARL), a variant of DRL, has shown to be more effective than single-agent RL in controlling flows exhibiting locality and translational invariance. We present, for the first time, an implementation of MARL-based control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Control is executed by modifying the temperature distribution along the bottom wall divided into multiple control segments, each of which acts as an independent agent. Two regimes of RBC are considered at Rayleigh numbers $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$. Evaluation of the learned control policy reveals a reduction in convection intensity by $23.5\%$ and $8.7\%$ at $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$, respectively. The MARL controller converts irregularly shaped convective patterns to regular straight rolls with lower convection that resemble flow in a relatively more stable regime. We draw comparisons with proportional control at both $\mathrm{Ra}$ and show that MARL is able to outperform the proportional controller. The learned control strategy is complex, featuring different non-linear segment-wise actuator delays and actuation magnitudes. We also perform successful evaluations on a larger domain than used for training, demonstrating that the invariant property of MARL allows direct transfer of the learnt policy.</description>

      <title>Single-snapshot machine learning for super-resolution of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine-learning techniques are generally considered data-hungry. However, this may not be the case for turbulence as each of its snapshots can hold more information than a single data file in general machine-learning settings. This study asks the question of whether nonlinear machine-learning techniques can effectively extract physical insights even from as little as a {\it single} snapshot of turbulent flow. As an example, we consider machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis that reconstructs a high-resolution field from low-resolution data for two examples of two-dimensional isotropic turbulence and three-dimensional turbulent channel flow. First, we reveal that a carefully designed machine-learning model trained with flow tiles sampled from only a single snapshot can reconstruct vortical structures across a range of Reynolds numbers for two-dimensional decaying turbulence. Successful flow reconstruction indicates that nonlinear machine-learning techniques can leverage scale-invariance properties to learn turbulent flows. We also show that training data of turbulent flows can be cleverly collected from a single snapshot by considering characteristics of rotation and shear tensors. Second, we perform the single-snapshot super-resolution analysis for turbulent channel flow, showing that it is possible to extract physical insights from a single flow snapshot even with inhomogeneity. The present findings suggest that embedding prior knowledge in designing a model and collecting data is important for a range of data-driven analyses for turbulent flows. More broadly, this work hopes to stop machine-learning practitioners from being wasteful with turbulent flow data.</description>

      <title>Mode sensitivity: Connecting Lagrangian coherent structures with modal analysis for fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between modal representations obtained from data-driven decomposition methods and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs). Mode sensitivity is used to describe this analysis as an extension of the model sensitivity framework developed by Kasz\'as and Haller (2020). The method, based on the computation of the finite-time-Lyapunov exponent, uses modes from fluid data to compute the amplitude perturbations experienced by fluid particle trajectories along with their sensitivity to initial conditions. Demonstrations of the method are presented with both periodic and turbulent flows, including a kinematic flow model, experimental data from the wake past an oscillating foil, numerical data of the classical cylinder wake flow, and a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. Mode sensitivity fields reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively how the finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields used to visualize LCSs change due to the influence of modes or external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Influence of three-dimensionality on wake synchronization of oscillatory cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of three-dimensionality on the synchronization characteristics of the wake behind an oscillating circular cylinder at Re = 300. Cylinder oscillations in rotation, transverse translation, and streamwise translation are considered. We utilize phase-reduction analysis, which quantifies the phase-sensitivity function of periodic flows, to examine the synchronization properties. Here, we present an ensemble-based framework for phase-reduction analysis to handle three-dimensional wakes that are not perfectly time-periodic. Based on the phase-sensitivity functions, synchronizability to three types of cylinder oscillations is evaluated. In spite of similar trends, we find that phase-sensitivity functions involving three-dimensional wakes are lower in magnitude compared to those of two-dimensional wakes, which leads to narrower conditions for synchronization to weak cylinder oscillations. We unveil that the difference between the phase-sensitivity functions of two- and three-dimensional flows is strongly correlated to the amplitude variation of the three-dimensional flow by the cylinder motions. This finding reveals that the cylinder motion modifies the three-dimensionality of the wake as well as the phase of vortex shedding, which leads to reduced phase modulation. The synchronization conditions of three-dimensional wakes, predicted by phase-reduction analysis, agree with the identification by parametric studies using direct numerical simulations for forced oscillations with small amplitudes. This study presents the potential capability of phase-reduction to study synchronization characteristics of complex flows.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in surface and volume flow in the laminar region, to optimize the matching between the pattern of a surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold on which the pattern is defined. The fiber bundle concept is used to describe the pattern of the surface structure together with the implicit 2-manifold as an ensemble defined on the preset base manifold. Topology optimization of the surface structure for mass and heat transfer in surface and volume flow is then implemented on the variable curved surface expressed as the implicit 2-manifold, which is defined on the preset base manifold by using a differentiable homeomorphism. For both of the surface and volume flow, two sets of design variables are defined for the pattern of the surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold. The fiber bundle topology optimization problems are analyzed by using the continuous adjoint method to derive the gradient information of the design objectives and constraints, and they are then solved by using the gradient based iterative procedures. In the numerical results, the effects of variable amplitude of the implicit 2-manifold, Reynolds number, P\'{e}clet number, and pressure drop or dissipation power of the fluid flow are investigated to demonstrate the extended design freedom and design space of fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in surface and volume flow.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional potential theory with a view towards vortex motion: Energy, capacity and Green functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
  We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Senseiver, a transformer neural network designed for sparse sensing applications, to estimate full-field surface height measurements of tsunami waves from sparse observations. The model is trained on a large ensemble of simulated data generated via a shallow water equations solver, which we show to be a faithful reproduction for the underlying dynamics by comparison to historical events. We train the model on a dataset consisting of 8 tsunami simulations whose epicenters correspond to historical USGS earthquake records, and where the model inputs are restricted to measurements obtained at actively deployed buoy locations. We test the Senseiver on a dataset consisting of 8 simulations not included in training, demonstrating its capability for extrapolation. The results show remarkable resolution of fine scale phase and amplitude features from the true field, provided that at least a few of the sensors have obtained a non-zero signal. Throughout, we discuss which forecasting techniques can be improved by this method, and suggest ways in which the flexibility of the architecture can be leveraged to incorporate arbitrary remote sensing data (eg. HF Radar and satellite measurements) as well as investigate optimal sensor placements.</description>
