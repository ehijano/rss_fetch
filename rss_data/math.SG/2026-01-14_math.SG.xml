      <title>Ample divisor complements, Floer spectra, and relative Gromov-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We spectrally lift Ganatra-Pomerleano's low-energy log PSS morphism to compute the associated graded of Floer homotopy types of ample smooth divisor complements. Moreover, we show the obstruction to splitting into the associated graded is encoded in a stable homotopy class defined via (higher-dimensional) genus 0 relative Gromov-Witten moduli spaces. We compute numerous examples of splittings, including the affine part of all smooth projective hypersurfaces of degree at least 2.</description>

      <title>The symplectic groupoid for Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure arises naturally in the study of $n$-th order differential operators on the circle and plays a central role in Poisson geometry and integrable systems. Let $G$ be one of the Lie groups $\mathrm{PSL}(n)$, $\mathrm{PSp}(n)$ (for even $n$), or $\mathrm{PSO}(n)$ (for odd $n$). In this paper, we construct the symplectic groupoid integrating the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure associated to $G$ and prove that it is Morita equivalent to the quasi-symplectic groupoid integrating the Dirac structure on $Y_n(\mathbf{C})$, where $Y_n(\mathbf{C})$ denotes the quotient of the space of quasi-periodic non-degenerate curves by homotopies preserving the monodromy.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Framework for the McKay Correspondence via Gauge-Theoretic Morse Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $\Gamma$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heegaard diagrams and knot Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unification of the Alexander and Jones polynomials via a new geometric perspective, involving "quantum Heegaard surfaces". Then, we prove that it leads to knot Floer homology and opens avenues for explicit geometric categorifications for the Jones polynomial. This model codifies the difference between the geometry of the Alexander and Jones polynomials via a quantum deformation of the Alexander grading, constructed on the surface.
  We do so by introducing a new type of diagram, called "quantum Heegaard diagram" (encoding the knot complement) together with a "quantum Alexander grading". This grading is a refinement of the Alexander grading used in knot Floer homology. Then we define a graded Lagrangian intersection, in two variables, between concrete Lagrangian submanifolds arising from the curves of the diagram in the symmetric power of the quantum Heegaard surface. The two-variable intersection unifies and recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. Moreover, this leads to knot Floer homology on one side and provides an intersection model for the Jones polynomial on the other. The surface and Lagrangian submanifolds are concretely constructed via braid actions on the punctured disc.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>
