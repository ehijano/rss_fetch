      <title>Asymptotic enumeration of normal and hybridization networks via tree decoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks provide a more general description of evolutionary relationships than rooted phylogenetic trees. One way to produce a phylogenetic network is to randomly place $k$ arcs between the edges of a rooted binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves. The resulting directed graph may fail to be a phylogenetic network, and even when it is (and thereby a `tree-based' network), it may fail to be a tree-child or normal network. In this paper, we first show that if $k$ is fixed, the proportion of arc placements that result in a normal network tends to 1 as $n$ grows. From this result, the asymptotic enumeration of normal networks becomes straightforward and provides a transparent meaning to the combinatorial terms that arise. Moreover, the approach extends to allow $k$ to grow with $n$ (at the rate $o(n^\frac{1}{3})$), which was not handled in earlier work. We also investigate a subclass of normal networks of particular relevance in biology (hybridization networks) and establish that the same asymptotic results apply.</description>

      <title>One predator and two prey: Coexistence of pumas, guanacos and sheep in Patagonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ecosystem considered in this study is the outcome of a lengthy sequence of historical and ecological events. Patagonia's indigenous fauna comprises survivors of five significant extinction events, with the notable presence of the puma and the guanaco, two of the largest native mammals. In addition to these, European immigrants introduced sheep into the ecosystem. Together, these three species form a straightforward trophic network, featuring one predator and two prey species, all competing within the Patagonian steppe. For ranchers, guanacos and pumas are frequently perceived as threats to their economic interests. In recent decades, the field of biology, particularly ecology, has witnessed a substantial increase in the development of equation-based models. Scientists are interested in the ability to systematize hypotheses and gain insights into the behavior of complex biological systems, such as the one presented in this study. However, the nonlinear nature and the large number of parameters of models, represent a challenge when one wants to explore the parameter space. To overcome this and, at the same time, improve the understanding of the Patagonia ecosystem, we start by building an equation-based model based on previous contributions, and we reduce it to the essential minimum set of parameters. Then, we introduce two tools, a generalization of ternary graphs and a perceptron based ML, to help understand the response of the system equation to the key parameters. The perceptron tool allows us to visualize/interpret the influence of each parameter on the survival or extinction of each species. Through the generalization of the ternary graph, it was possible to conveniently visualize how the system responds to different combinations/variations of the five parameters of the reduced system equation in a single graphical representation.</description>

      <title>Persistence/extinction scenarios in an almost periodic metapopulation with competition and habitat destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an almost periodic version of a metapopulation model developed by Tilman \textit{et.al} and Nee \textit{et.al} in the nineties, which generalizes the classical Levins approach by considering several species in competition affected by habitat destruction. The novelty is to assume that the colonization and extinction rates are positive almost periodic functions whereas our main results show that the predominance of either colonization or extinction forces of a specific species is equivalent to the property of exponential dichotomy of a scalar linear differential equation. By using well known results of exponential dichotomy theory, we carry out a recursive and exhaustive description of persistence/extinction scenarios. In addition, we start a preliminary discussion describing a more elusive behavior when the colonization and extinction forces are similar in average.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book brings new mathematical rigour to the ongoing vigorous debate on how to quantify biological diversity. The question "what is diversity?" has surprising mathematical depth, and breadth too: this book involves parts of mathematics ranging from information theory, functional equations and probability theory to category theory, geometric measure theory and number theory. It applies the power of the axiomatic method to a biological problem of pressing concern, but the new concepts and theorems are also motivated from a purely mathematical perspective.
  The main narrative thread requires no more than an undergraduate course in analysis. No familiarity with entropy or diversity is assumed.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>
