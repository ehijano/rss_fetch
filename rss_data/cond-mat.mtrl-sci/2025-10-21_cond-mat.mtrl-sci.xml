      <title>Engineering phase-frustration induced flat bands in an aza-triangulene covalent Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced One-Dimensional Magnetism in CrSBr Chains via Carbon Nanotube Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encapsulating low-dimensional magnetic materials within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offers a compelling route to stabilize unconventional magnetic states and engineer quantum functionalities at the limit of miniaturization. In this work, we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of one-dimensional (1D) CrSBr chains encapsulated within CNTs using density functional theory (DFT) and spin dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the structural stability of CrSBr@CNT, where confinement and charge transfer cooperate to stabilize ferromagnetism in the 1D limit, which persists up to 50 K. These findings position CrSBr@CNT as a model platform for realizing 1D magnetism and establish CNT encapsulation as a powerful strategy for exploring emergent quantum spin phenomena and engineering nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Antimodes in Multi-Drive Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <title>Coherent and Dynamic Small Polaron Delocalization in CuFeO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications.</description>

      <title>Infrared Absorption and Laser Spectroscopy of Ho$^{3+}$ Doped K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy are used to determine electronic energy levels for Ho$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 72 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 8 multiplets, are assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Ho$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Partially-resolved hyperfine splittings are accurately reproduced by the model. The temperature dependence of the fluorescent lifetime of the $^5$F$_5$ multiplet is measured and the temperature dependence of the non-radiative relaxation is modelled by a five-phonon process. Preliminary measurements of infra-red to visible upconversion in microparticles co-doped with Ho$^{3+}$ and Yb$^{3+}$ is reported.</description>

      <title>Electron Localization in Non-Compact Covalent Bonds Captured by the r2SCAN+V Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In density functional theory, the SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed) and r2SCAN functionals significantly improve over generalized gradient approximation functionals such as PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) in predicting electronic, magnetic, and structural properties across various materials, including transition-metal compounds. However, there remain puzzling cases where SCAN and r2SCAN underperform, such as in calculating the band structure of graphene, the magnetic moment of Fe, the potential energy curve of the Cr2 molecule, and the bond length of VO2. This research identifies a common characteristic among these challenging materials: non-compact covalent bonding through s-s, p-p, or d-d electron hybridization. While SCAN and r2SCAN excel at capturing electron localization at local atomic sites, they struggle to accurately describe electron localization in non-compact covalent bonds, resulting in a biased improvement. To address this issue, we propose the r2SCAN+V approach as a practical modification that improves accuracy across all the tested materials. The parameter V is 4 eV for metallic Fe, but substantially lower for the other cases. Our findings provide valuable insights for the future development of advanced functionals.</description>

      <title>Stacking-tunable multiferroic states in bilayer ScI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional(2D) multiferroic materials hold significant promise for advancing the miniaturization and integration of nanodevices. In this study, we demonstrate that 2D bilayer ScI2, which exhibits ferromagnetic(FM) ordering within each layer, enables the tuning of interlayer magnetic coupling, ferroelectricity, and valley polarization through interlayer sliding and rotation. Our first-principles calculations show that the AA stacking configuration induces antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling, while a 180 rotation of one layer (resulting in the antialigned AA stacking) leads to FM interlayer coupling. Moreover, the interlayer magnetic coupling can be switched between AFM and FM by translating the stacking configuration: FM in the aligned AB and BA configurations, and AFM in the antialigned AB and BA configurations. This switching behavior is driven by variations in superexchange interactions due to orbital hopping between layers. Notably, the aligned stacking exhibits ferroelectricity upon sliding, which is induced by interlayer orbital hybridization and the resulting asymmetric charge redistribution, with maximal ferroelectric behavior occurring at the AB and BA stacking configurations. Additionally, for the AB and BA stackings, spontaneous valley polarization emerges from the manipulation of the spin orientation toward the out-of-plane direction. This valley polarization arises due to inversion symmetry breaking, either through ferroelectricity (in the AB and BA stackings) or AFM interlayer coupling , in combination with spin-orbit coupling. These results highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism, ferroelectricity, and valley polarization in bilayer ScI2, with each property being tunable via stacking configuration.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-concentration-dependent thermal stability of fcc-(Ti,Al)Nx predicted via chemical-environment-sensitive diffusion activation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal decomposition of metastable fcc-(Ti,Al)Nx limits the lifetime of coated components. While energetic decomposition aspects can be modelled reliably, the inherent variability of chemical environment-dependent diffusion activation energies remains systematically unexplored. Here, we predict an activation energy range (envelope) for mass transport in varying chemical environments, reflecting the vacancy concentration range fcc-(Ti0.5Al0.5)1-xNx with x = 0.47, 0.5, 0.53. The stoichiometric compound shows maximum thermal stability, consistent with experimental data. Metal vacancies decrease the average migration energy, while metal and nitrogen vacancies reduce barriers via lattice strain relaxation, enhancing mobility. The strong chemical environment dependence challenges conclusions from single-point activation energy data.</description>

      <title>Surface Reactivity in Low Temperature Deposited Amorphous/Crystalline SnO2 Thin Films: Chemisorbed Oxygen Activity and CO Oxidation Pathways Revealed by In Situ XPS and Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates two critical aspects of the gas sensing mechanism in metal oxide sensors: (1) the conditions that maximize chemisorbed oxygen concentration as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, and (2) which surface oxygen species (chemisorbed or lattice-bound) are primarily responsible for interaction with carbon monoxide (CO). SnO2 thin films, deposited at temperatures as low as 60 C and exhibiting mixed amorphous-crystalline phases with open, tortuous porosity, were evaluated for CO sensing at 200 C. Comprehensive characterization using EIS, MS, XPS, TEM, and sensor tests revealed a strong correlation between high sensing performance and the structural/electronic features of the defect rich low-temperature-deposited SnO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to identify the optimal sensing temperature. Mass spectroscopy (MS) used to analyze the exhaust gases after sensing reactions. The films exhibited oxygen under-stoichiometry and high concentrations of chemisorbed oxygen species. In situ XPS under 1 mbar (10000 ppm) O2 and CO exposures showed that chemisorbed oxygen, not lattice oxygen, was actively involved in CO oxidation, as further confirmed by CO2 detection via Mass spectroscopy (MS). Quantitative analysis revealed dynamic surface chemical status alternations, emphasizing the pivotal role of chemisorbed oxygen in the sensing mechanism at 200 C.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a ternary compound, Eu$_{0.8}$Pt$_6$Al$_{15.8}$. We determine its chemical and structural characteristics based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as well as both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, demonstrating that it crystallizes in a hexagonal structure type EuPt$_6$Al$_{16}$ with no reported structural analog. The electronic and magnetic properties are characterized by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization, and temperature-dependent resistance measurements, revealing that the Eu$^{2+}$ magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically below 2.8 K.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond photo-induced displacive phase transition in Sb$_{2}$Te (group 2) phase-change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two classes of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have emerged as the best candidates for applications requiring the fast reading and writing of data: GeTe-Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ pseudobinary alloys (group 1) and doped Sb-Te compounds near the eutectic composition Sb$_{70}$Te$_{30}$ (group 2). Both material classes undergo reversible switching between a low-resistance opaque crystalline phase and a high-resistance but less absorbing amorphous phase through heating, electrical, or optical pulses, achieving (sub-)nanosecond switching speeds. While group 1 compounds are employed in current generation devices and relatively well studied, model systems in group 2 compounds have been found to crystallize more rapidly and thus offer the perspective of improved devices. Despite their superior crystallization speed (SET process), to this point there have been no ultrafast experimental studies on crystallized PCMs of group 2 for the RESET process. Here we perform ultrafast electron diffraction and femtosecond resolved sum frequency non-linear spectroscopy on Peierls distorted Sb$_{2}$Te crystallized thin films (PCM of group 2) following femtosecond optical pulse irradiation. We observe a pump-induced structural change on two distinct timescales: responses with characteristic timescales of $\approx$ 300 fs and 2~ps. We quantified the experimental result by a coherent displacement and the Debye-Waller effect. In particular, the $\approx$ 300 fs UED signal results from the ultrafast release of the Peierls distortion through non-thermal coherent Sb displacement, while the 2~ps response reflects electron-lattice equilibrium. These results reveal the ultrafast non-thermal structural dynamics of Sb$_{2}$Te and suggest energy-efficient switching of group 2 PCMs should be possible on femtosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Unified Electronic and Interatomic Potentials: Strain-tunable Electronic Structures in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UEIPNet, an equivariant graph neural network designed to predict both interatomic potentials and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians for an atomic structure. The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Structural Origin of Chirality in Magic-Size Semiconductor Nanoclusters through Self-Assembly Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor magic-size clusters (MSCs) are atomically precise nanoparticles exhibiting unique size-dependent properties, but their ultrasmall dimensions hinder structural characterization, limiting our understanding of their formation and stability. A few MSC structures have been fully resolved, revealing either bulk-like zincblende-type structures or a range of non-bulk-like motifs. Here we use a computational model to investigate the relationship between cluster size and atomic structure in zincblende-forming II-VI and III-V semiconductors. Firstly, we find that all non-bulk-like MSCs in these systems exhibit the same distorted icosahedral motif that is intrinsically chiral. Secondly, we reproduce these MSC geometries in small-cluster self-assembly simulations and discover that their chirality emerges from the geometric frustration and symmetry breaking in arranging tetrahedral bonding environments into an icosahedral topology. Overall, this work reproduces experimentally reported motifs without system-specific parameterization, establishes the structural origin of chirality in MSCs, and provides design principles for predicting new cluster geometries.</description>

      <title>Structure and stability of 7:3 rare earth oxide-phosphates: a combined ab initio and experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth oxide-phosphates (REOPs) form a largely unexplored family of refractory lanthanides and yttrium compounds with general formula RExOy(PO4)z. They are of interest for applications ranging from thermal barrier coatings to catalysts and magnetic materials. At least four REOPs phases were experimentally identified with RE/P ratios from 7:3 to 6:1, however the structures were solved only for 3:1 phases (RE3O3(PO4)). In this work we report the structure for the 7:3 phases (RE7O6(PO4)3) derived by ab initio analysis of models based on previously reported oxide-vanadate analogues. The most stable structures for all 7:3 REOPs were found to be isotypic, adopting monoclinic symmetry with space group P21/c. The structures were validated by comparison of their powder X-ray diffraction patterns to those of synthesized La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Tb 7:3 phases (Rietveld refinement for all except Tb). Ab initio analysis of thermodynamic stability showed that all 7:3 REOPs are unstable at 0 K toward decomposition to REPO4 and RE3PO7 or RE2O3. The entropy contribution stabilizes RE7O6(PO4)3 phases for light rare earth elements above 1000 K, however, starting with Dy, computationally predicted stabilization temperature is higher than estimated melting points of RE7O6(PO4)3, which is consistent with observed synthesis pattern.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting nanotubes derived from a rectangular graphyne: a DFT study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposing new ways to organize carbon in 2D nanomaterials has been a relevant strategy in the search for systems with targeted properties for different applications. One focus is the study of fully sp$^2$ non-graphitic networks, with successfully synthesized examples. Hybrid sp-sp$^2$ systems of the graphyne family are a related approach, and many systems have the honeycomb lattice as a base model. However, other examples have been inspired by other lattices as the recently proposed r$\gamma$GY sheet, which features a semiconducting behavior with highly localized \emph{quasi}-1D states. Here, we investigate how to tune r$\gamma$GY properties by folding this sheet into nanotube forms. We elucidate mechanisms that determine their electronic structure by means of density functional theory calculations, as well as we identify the interplay involving chirality, diameter, and the emergence of dispersive/localized frontier states on gap modulation through simple extrapolated methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient small-cell sampling for machine-learning potentials of multi-principal element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) exhibit exceptional properties but face significant challenges in developing accurate machine-learning potentials (MLPs) due to their vast compositional and configurational complexity. Here, we introduce an efficient small-cell sampling (SCS) method, which allows for generating diverse and representative training datasets for MPEAs using only small-cell structures with just one and two elements, thereby bypassing the computational overhead of iterative active learning cycles and large-cell density functional theory calculations. The efficacy of the method is carefully validated through principal component analysis, extrapolation grades evaluation, and root-mean-square errors and physical properties assessment on the TiZrHfCuNi system. Further demonstrations on TiZrVMo, CoCrFeMnNi, and AlTiZrNbHfTa systems accurately reproduce complex phenomena including phase transitions, chemical orderings, and thermodynamic properties. This work establishes an efficient one-shot protocol for constructing high-quality training datasets across multiple elements, laying a solid foundation for developing universal MLPs for MPEAs.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Multiferroics from Coupling of Fractional Quantum Ferroelectricity and Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroics, which combine ferroelectric and magnetic order, offer a transformative platform for next-generation electronic devices. However, the intrinsic competition between the mechanisms driving ferroelectricity and magnetism in single-phase materials severely limits their performance, typically resulting in weak magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing challenge through the novel concept of fractional quantum multiferroics (FQMF), where strong magnetoelectric coupling is naturally realized by coupling fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE) with altermagnetism (AM). Symmetry analysis shows that reversing the FQFE polarization necessarily inverts the AM spin splitting under parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) or time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}\tau$) operations. A minimal tight-binding model reproduces this effect, demonstrating electrically driven spin control without rotating the N\'eel vector. First-principles calculations further identify a broad family of candidate materials in two and three dimensions including bulk MnTe, Cr$_2$S$_3$, Mn$_4$Bi$_3$NO$_{15}$ and two-dimensional AB$_2$ bilayers such as MnX$_2$ (X=Cl, Br, I), CoCl$_2$, CoBr$_2$, and FeI$_2$. Notably, MnTe exhibits a high N\'eel temperature ($\sim$300 K) and a large electrically switchable spin splitting ($\sim$0.8 eV), demonstrating room-temperature magnetoelectric performance that surpasses that of conventional multiferroics. To further showcase the technological potential, we propose an electric-field-controlled FQMF tunnel junction based on MnTe that achieves tunneling magnetoresistance exceeding 300\%. This work establishes FQMF as a distinct and promising route to achieving room-temperature strong magnetoelectric coupling, opening a new avenue for voltage-controlled spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We report a three-stage synthesis of a hybrid metal-carbon 2D material, in which cobalt atoms are covalently embedded in the graphene-like carbon (GLC) matrix. The resulting material (CoGLC) exhibits a distinctive XRD pattern indicative of the ordered arrangement of cobalt atoms in the layers.

      <title>Intermediate-Band Formation in Tm3+-doped Ca2SnO4: A Wide-Gap Oxide Host for Visible-Light Absorption and Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth doping is an effective way to convert chemically stable oxides into multifunctional materials with coupled electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. We present first principles calculations of pristine and Tm3+ doped Ca2SnO4 to understand how localized 4f states change the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior of the host. Pristine Ca2SnO4 is a mechanically stable, wide band gap insulator with mostly ionic covalent bonding and diamagnetic character. Replacing Ca2+ with Tm3+ introduces several key changes: (i) localized Tm 4f states create intermediate levels inside the wide gap, reducing the optical band gap; (ii) exchange and spin orbit interactions generate strong local magnetic moments and spin asymmetry near the conduction band; (iii) electron localization function analysis shows enhanced covalency and electron pockets that stabilize luminescent centers; and (iv) the optical response shows visible range absorption, refractive index features, and low energy plasmon peaks while maintaining high energy dielectric stability. These effects make Tm doped Ca2SnO4 a mechanically robust, optically tunable, and magnetically active oxide phosphor suitable for red emission, intermediate band photovoltaics, and spin photon coupling. More broadly, our results show how targeted rare earth substitution can enable multifunctionality in wide gap stannates and guide the design of next generation spintronic photonic oxides.</description>

      <title>A first-principles investigation of the diffusivities of oxygen and oxygen defects in ThO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis is presented for the diffusivity of oxygen defects and oxygen self-diffusion in ThO$-2$. The migration energy and diffusivity of oxygen defects with nominal charges have been investigated using density functional theory and phonon simulations. The pathway for the lowest migration energy barrier of oxygen vacancies was found to be along the $\langle 100 \rangle$ direction. Neutral and non-neutral oxygen interstitials exhibited direct (interstitial) and indirect (interstitialcy) migration, respectively. The vacancy migration barrier was found to be lowest for the highest charge, while for interstitials, it is lowest when the charge is lowest. The attempt frequencies of defects were calculated using the Eyring and Vineyard theories. These frequencies displayed a similar dependence on the defect charge as the activation barriers. The charge-averaged diffusivity of vacancies and interstitials were also computed. Across all temperatures, the average vacancy diffusivity was found to be greater than that of interstitial, indicating that oxygen vacancies are more mobile than interstitials. Oxygen self- and chemical diffusion coefficients were analyzed by combining the defect diffusivities with the concentrations computed using an equilibrium defect thermodynamics. The self-diffusion coefficient of oxygen was found to rise with temperatures and lower oxygen pressures. The contributions of various defects to self-diffusion of oxygen were subsequently examined. In the normal to high oxygen pressure range, at all temperatures, it is found that interstitials contribute most to oxygen diffusion in ThO2. At low oxygen pressures, vacancies with highest charge state were found to dominate oxygen diffusion. The chemical diffusion coefficient of oxygen was further computed, which was found to increase with temperature and decrease with hypo-stoichiometry in ThO2 to a plateau value.</description>

      <title>Coherent terahertz control of metastable magnetization in FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain, pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile, on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation. In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered, light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Exploring transition pathways in the Landau-Brazovskii model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an interpretation method for deep learning models that allows us to handle high-dimensional spectral data in materials science. The proposed method uses feature extraction and clustering analysis to categorize materials into classes based on similarities in both spectral data and chemical characteristics such as elemental composition and atomic arrangement. As a demonstration, we apply this method to an atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) model trained on first-principles calculation data of 2,681 metal oxides, chalcogenides, and related compounds for optical absorption spectrum prediction. Our analysis reveals key elemental species and their coordination environments that influence optical absorption onset characteristics. The method proposed herein is broadly applicable to the classification and interpretation of diverse spectral data, extending beyond the optical absorption spectra of inorganic crystals.</description>

Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Mechanism from NH3 and CH4 on Ni-Doped Graphene: Tuning Electronic and Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a multi-scale computational modeling approach, combining density functional theory (DFT) and self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB), to investigate hydrogen (H2) production and dissociation mechanisms from ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) on pristine and nickel-doped graphene. These two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for applications in advanced gas sensing and catalysis. Our analysis reveals that Ni-doped graphene, validated through work function calculations, is a promising material for gas separation and hydrogen production. The samples with adsorbed molecules are characterized by calculating chemical potential, chemical hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, vibrational frequencies, adsorbtion and Gibbs energies by DFT calculations. Methane molecules preferentially adsorb at the hexagonal ring centers of graphene, while ammonia inter-acts more strongly with carbon atoms, highlighting distinct molecular doping mechanisms for CH4 and NH3. Dynamic simulations show that CH4 splits into CH3+H, with Ni-doped graphene facilitating enhanced hydrogen transmission, while NH3 dissociates into NH2+H, which may lead to N2H4 formation. Our non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulations demonstrate increased H-atom transmission on Ni-doped graphene during gas interactions. These findings suggest that Ni-doped graphene is superior to pristine graphene for applications in gas separation, hydrogen production, and high-sensitivity sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports optical and electronic numerical modelling of a novel emerging structure which is the GaAs nanocrystal on Si tandem solar cell by epitaxial lateral overgrowth, a technique which allows defect free material growth. The techniqueconsists of creating nucleation sites in a silicon surface SiO2 layer and initiating growth of nanoscalescale seeds, whereby strain energy remains below the Matthews-Blakeslee strain relaxation limit. This leads to AlxGaAs growth in micro-crystals without generation of material defects. The focus of this presentation is optical and electrical modelling of nanocrystals for applications in the very active field of silicon based multijunction solar cells, and design of a AlxGaAs/Si two terminal tandem, for compositions ranging from x=0 to x=30% in absorber layers. We present a model of the complete structure in two dimensions, consisting of a Al xGaAs high bandgap subcell connected with a tunnel junction to the low bandgap Si junction. The elaboration of models is described, with an emphasis on the AlxGaAs crystal featuring a non-planar pn-junction, and a focus on the optical properties of this lattice of micrometric AlGaAs crystals and in particular their light trapping properties from the resulting surface texture. The question of AlxGaAs surface coverage is addressed, given that neighbouring AlxGaAs crystals have different crystal orientations on a (111) Si surface, such that any coalescence of neighbour AlxGaAs crystals leads to crippling defects at their interface. The result is that some high energy incident light above the AlxGaAs bandgap is nevertheless transmitted directly to the Si cell, such that the resulting photogenerated carriers thermalise to the Silicon bandgap, and result in a loss of efficiency. The interface between AlxGaAs and Si subcells is addressed, with an emphasis on current transport efficiency through the nanoseeds and tunnelling currents through appropriately designed SiO2 buffer layers. This work therefore presents a theoretical framework for evaluating the potential of AlxGaAs nanocrystal growth on Si for light trapping, for GaAs silicon two terminal tandem cell performance including tunnel junctions, and provides models and design rules for efficient AlxGaAs microcrystal arrays as high bandgap subcells for tandem solar cells on silicon.</description>

Abstract: Improvement of functional and structural fatigue endurance for applications of ferroelastic materials requires an optimization of their composition. A strategy for finding alloy compositions that minimize the transformation hysteresis is necessary. We propose an experimental high throughput methodology to explore the model \b{eta}-Cu-Zn-Al system. It is based on an original route to process bulk gradient composition single crystals to investigate fine variation of composition range coupled with local measurements of the austenite-martensite microstructure by light microscopy during the transformation. The latter method is compared with differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The methodology is applied in an Al-richer range of composition of standard CuZnAl SMA where a minimum of transformation hysteresis is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bond rupture under the action of external forces is induced by temperature fluctuations. We show that measured forces from single molecule force spectroscopy experiments can be predicted from two quantities describing the bond that are the barrier to break the bond in absence of force as well as the maximal force the bond can withstand. The former can be obtained by a force free transition state calculation and the latter is determined by a simple constrained ge- ometry simulates forces (COGEF) calculation. Considering experimental temperature and force loading rate allows the prediction of measured bond rupture forces from a closed expression with very good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Chemically tailored planar defect phases in the Ta-Fe {\mu}-phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermetallics often exhibit complex crystal structures, which give rise to intricate defect structures that critically influence their mechanical and functional properties. Despite studies on individual defect types, a comprehensive understanding of the defect landscape in {\mu}-phases, a class of topologically close-packed phases, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the planar defect structures in the Ta-Fe {\mu}-phase across a compositional range of 46 to 58 at.% Ta using electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Electron backscatter diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a transition from basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 TaFe2 Laves phase layers at a low Ta content to pyramidal {1\bar{1}02} twins at a higher Ta content. Density functional theory calculations of defect formation energies confirm a chemical potential-driven stabilisation of Laves phase lamellae. The prevalence of pyramidal twins in Ta-rich {\mu}-phase samples is attributed to the competitive nature of different planar defects during solidification. A defect landscape for {\mu}-phases is proposed, illustrating the interplay between site occupancy, dislocation types and planar faults across the chemical potential space. These findings provide fundamental insights into defect engineering in structurally complex intermetallics and open pathways for optimising material properties through chemical tuning.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study for Screening High-Selectivity Inhibitors in Area-Selective Atomic Layer Deposition on Amorphous Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) is an emerging technology in semiconductor manufacturing. However, accurately understanding inhibitor reactivity on surfaces remains challenging, particularly when the substrate is amorphous. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate reaction pathways and quantify the reactivity of (N,N-dimethylamino)trimethylsilane (DMATMS) and ethyltrichlorosilane (ETS) at silanol (-OH), siloxane (-O-), amine (-NH2), and imide (-NH-) sites on both amorphous and crystalline silicon oxide and silicon nitride surfaces. Notably, both molecules exhibit greater reactivity toward terminal sites (-OH and -NH2) on amorphous surfaces compared to crystalline counterparts. For bridge sites, -O- and -NH-, multiple reaction pathways are identified, with bridge-cleavage reactions being the predominant mechanism, except for DMATMS reactions with nitride surfaces. The reactivity of DMATMS with -NH- sites is comparable to that with -NH2, with both reactions yielding volatile products. This study underscores the importance of amorphous surface modeling in reliably predicting inhibitor adsorption and reactivity on realistic surfaces. Moreover, we outline a computational screening approach that accounts for site-specific precursor-inhibitor interactions, enabling efficient and rational theoretical design of AS-ALD precursor-inhibitor pairs.</description>

      <title>Electrical properties of PbS films doped with iodine by chemical bath deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of measurements of bulk current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and local surface I-V characteristics by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of iodine-doped PbS films. It is established that bulk I-V curves of both undoped and iodine-doped PbS films demonstrate a linear (ohmic) U(I) dependence. The tipe of local surface I-V characteristics is ohmic at the concentration range of the dopant 0&lt;[NH4I]&lt;=0.10 M and becomes rectifying at [NH4I]&gt;=0.15 M, which is determined by a decrease in the size and a change in the shape of the film grains, as well as a decrease in the surface roughness of the film. An increase in the iodine content in the PbS(I) films leads to nonlinear dependences of the microscopic characteristics and photoelectric parameters of the PbS(I) films. A sharp decrease in the diffusion coefficient, the beginning of an increase in the charge carrier lifetime, a maximum in voltage sensitivity and specific detectability are observed in the PbS(I) film chemically deposited from a reaction mixture containing [NH4I] = 0.15 M. This indicates that the optimalconcentration of iodine in the film is 2.7 at.%.</description>

      <title>Hybridization in van der Waals epitaxy of PtSe2/h-BN and PtSe2/graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which combine bi-dimensional materials of different properties, enable a range of quantum phenomena. Here, we present a comparative study between the electronic properties of mono- and bi-layer of platinum diselenide (PtSe2) grown on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT), the electronic structure of PtSe2/graphene and PtSe2/h-BN vdW heterostructures are investigated in systematic manner. In contrast to PtSe2/h-BN, the electronic structure of PtSe2/graphene reveals the presence of interlayer hybridization between PtSe2 and the graphene, which is evidenced by minigap openings in the {\pi}-band of graphene. Furthermore, our measurements show that the valence band maximum (VBM) of monolayer PtSe2 is located at the {\Gamma} point with different binding energies of about -0.9 eV and -0.55 eV relative to the Fermi level on h-BN and graphene and substrates, respectively. Our results represent a significant advance in the understanding of electronic hybridization between TMDs and different substrates, and they reaffirm the crucial role of the substrate in any nanoelectronic applications based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Chiral soft mode transition driven by strain in ferroelectric bubble domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in solids is attracting growing attention as a potential ferroic order, yet virtually no paradigmatic example of a soft-mode achiral-to-chiral phase transition has been firmly established to date. Here we identify ferroelectric bubble domains as a model system that undergoes a strain-driven achiral-to-chiral transition exhibiting the hallmarks of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Using second-principles atomistic simulations, we uncover chiral phonon modes in ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices that soften under epitaxial strain following textbook soft-mode behaviour. The transition is accompanied by a change in topological character, highlighting an interplay between chirality and topology in these systems. This work provides a concrete step towards establishing chirality as a genuine ferroic order in solids.</description>

      <title>On chaotic regimes of conductivity behavior in the tight-binding approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the probability of detecting the most nontrivial conductivity behavior regimes in metals whose electron spectrum is described by the tight-binding approximation. These regimes are associated with the emergence of highly complex electron trajectories on the Fermi surface and correspond to a nontrivial (scaling) behavior of the conductivity tensor in strong magnetic fields. The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have not yet been observed experimentally. The results of our study allow us, in particular, to estimate the probability of their occurrence and to indicate the conditions for their possible detection for a wide class of conductors.</description>

      <title>Sub-unit cell engineering of CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered corundum oxides introduce new prospects in the field of functional oxides thin films, complementing the more widely studied class of ABO$_3$ perovskites. In this work, we take advantage of the layer-by-layer growth regime to fabricate epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films with atomic-scale accuracy on the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers. By means of X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we confirm the thickness control in the sub-unit cell scale, alternating 3, 2 or 1 single atomic layers of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and V$_2$O$_3$. For the first time, we stabilize the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) and compare the functional properties of the thin film with those calculated by density functional theory. This novel approach to the growth of ordered corundum oxides opens the path towards the stabilization of new complex oxides with tailored properties by varying the composition and the superlattice period, ultimately broadening the family of functional rhombohedral oxides.</description>

      <title>Design and theory of switchable linear magnetoelectricity by ferroelectricity in Type-I multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling mechanisms in 19 altermagnetic and 4 ferrimagnetic Type-I multiferroics using electronic band structure calculations with spin-orbit coupling, a first-principles ME response framework, and spin-space-group theory analysis. We formulate a universal scheme for realizing nonvolatile ME coupling in Type-I multiferroics, where two distinct pathways emerge, each dictated by spin-space symmetry. The first pathway is associated with switching of the spin splitting or the now familiar spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space, characteristic of some altermagnetic mul-tiferroics that exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. The second pathway involves real-space magnetization switching via electric polarization reversal, characterized by switchable components of the linear ME tensor, despite the traditionally weak coupling in Type-I systems due to the independent origins of magnetism and ferroelectricity. We demonstrate that these two intrinsic ME coupling mechanisms are mutually exclusive and propose thermodynami-cally stable compounds for experimentation. Our findings establish general design principles for controlling robust nonvolatile ME effects in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning method to determine concentrations of structural defects in irradiated materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and subsequent growth of structural defects in an irradiated material can strongly influence the material's performance in technological and industrial applications. Predicting how the growth of defects affects material performance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common computational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster dynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track the time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the computational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical implementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of physical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and pressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the computational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high accuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated on the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other materials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture complex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation conditions, and the concentration of defects.</description>

      <title>Broad-Range Tuning of Ferroelectric Switching of LaxBi1-xFeO3 Epitaxial Films via Digital Doping using Off-Axis Co-Sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the scope of ferroelectric behavior in La-substituted BiFeO3 films, LaxBi1-xFeO3 epitaxial films were synthesized using off-axis co-sputtering on SrTiO3(001) and DyScO3(110) substrates with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode layer. A digital-doping deposition method was used to enable precise control and continuous tuning of La concentration in high-quality LaxBi1-xFeO3 films across a wide range of x = 0.05-0.60, which was systematically investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy. Robust and reversible out-of-plane ferroelectric switching has been observed up to x = 0.35, while films with x $\geq$ 0.37 exhibit no measurable ferroelectric behavior, indicating a sharp ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition between x = 0.35 and 0.37. This represents the highest reported La concentration in LaxBi1-xFeO3 films that retains ferroelectric ordering, highlighting opportunities to engineer ferroelectric and multiferroic properties in complex oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenated Aluminum Doped Zinc Oxide as Highly Transparent and Passivating Indium-Free Recombination Junction for TOPCon-Based Bottom Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tandem solar cells offer a promising alternative to exceed the efficiency limits of single-junction silicon photovoltaics, yet they require high-performance recombination junctions that are transparent, passivating, and electrically efficient. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is conventionally used as a recombination junction material, faces challenges related to indium scarcity and sputter-induced damage. This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a viable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited AZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200 nm wavelength range. When applied to n-TOPCon surfaces with an AlOx capping layer, the stack achieves an outstanding passivation quality, indicated by implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) values up to 734 mV after annealing. The AlOx capping layer proved crucial for enhancing thermal stability by preventing hydrogen effusion at higher temperatures. While the contact resistivity was high for the 20 nm thick films tested, the combination of superior optical and passivation properties establishes spatial ALD-deposited AZO:H as a highly promising material for creating efficient and indiumfree recombination junctions in next-generation tandem solar cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends. Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS - 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Unifying Polymer Modeling and Design via a Conformation-Centric Generative Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining. Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and powerful tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory has demonstrated remarkable predictive power in calculating magnetic properties at zero temperature. At finite temperatures, thermally excited phonons may affect magnetism. Efficient ab-initio methods to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetic exchange interactions are still lacking despite the importance of room temperature magnetism for applications. Exchange is controlled by an interplay between metal-ligand hybridization, Hubbard repulsion, band gap, interatomic distances and bond angles, all of which change with temperature. Here we present a method to calculate the exchange interactions at finite temperatures from first principles using only two supercell calculations and quantify these mechanisms. Changes in bond angles and the band gap are identified as a primary factors. In NiO with 180-degree bonds exchange decreases with temperature, while in Cr$_2$O$_3$ with the bond angles away from 180 degrees the exchange increases by 10% at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced coherent magnetization and polaritons in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: A false zero resistance behavior was observed during our study on the search of superconductivity in Ge-doped GaNb4Se8. This zero resistance was proved to be caused by open-circuit in multi-phase samples comprised of metals and insulators by measuring with four-probe method. The evidence strongly suggests that the reported superconductivity in hydrides should be carefully re-checked.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Charge and Spin Transport in $\beta12$ Borophene Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic propagation method beyond the sequential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ stochastic propagation method, which relies on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation using random initial states, is widely used in large-scale first-principles calculations. In this work, we eliminate the conventional sequential computation of intermediate states by introducing a concurrent strategy that minimizes information redundancy. The new method, in its state-, moment-, and energy-based implementations, not only surpasses the time step constraint of sequential propagation but also maintains precision within the framework of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Systematic benchmarking on one billion atoms within the tight-binding model demonstrates that our new concurrent method achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling the rapid computation of a wide range of electronic, optical, and transport properties. This performance breakthrough offers valuable insights for enhancing other time-propagation algorithms, including those employed in large-scale stochastic density functional theory.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting, enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector, Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting. Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields, and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and logic.</description>

      <title>Mott vs Kondo: Influence of Various Density Functional Based Methods on the Ce Isostructural Phase Transition Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cerium iso-structural phase transition (gamma to alpha) is dominated by f-electron localization changes that results in a magnetic ordering change and a volume collapse. Generally, these physics are difficult to capture with ab initio and first principles methods. However, previous works have shown various methods to be successful in predicting at least some of the physics of the gamma to alpha phase transition. Therefore, here, we perform a broad survey of density functional based methods across three levels of theory and types of functions (GGA, MetaGGA, and Hybrid functionals) and compare the results, focusing on hydrostatic compression across the phase boundary at zero Kelvin. For the methods that best reproduce experimental results, we directly probe the predicted mechanisms and frame the results in the Mott/Kondo debate, assessing how the underlying methods and assumptions of different functionals can assess the physical drivers in the phase transition, providing insight into the governing dynamics of this unique phase transition.</description>

      <title>Atomic relaxation and flat bands in strain-engineered transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer moir\'{e} systems</title>

Abstract: Strain-induced lattice mismatch leads to moir\'{e} patterns in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We investigate the structural and electronic properties of such strained moir\'{e} patterns in TMD homobilayers. The moir\'{e} patterns in strained TMDs consist of several stacking domains which are separated by tensile solitons. Relaxation of these systems distributes the strain unevenly in the moir\'{e} superlattice, with the maximum strain energy concentrating at the highest energy stackings. The order parameter distribution shows the formation of aster topological defects at the same sites. In contrast, twisted TMDs host shear solitons at the domain walls, and the order parameter distribution in these systems shows the formation of vortex defects. The strained moir\'{e} systems also show the emergence of several well-separated flat bands at both the valence and conduction band edges, and we observe a significant reduction in the band gap. The flat bands in these strained moir\'{e} superlattices provide platforms for studying the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice as well as the ionic Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, we study the localization of the wave functions corresponding to these flat bands. The wave functions localize at different stackings compared to twisted TMDs, and our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic experiments.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Crystalline Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic transport underpins the performance of materials in technologies such as energy storage and electronics, yet its simulation remains computationally demanding. In particular, modeling ionic diffusion in solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) requires methods that can overcome the scale limitations of traditional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate MD simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 SSE candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent pseudo-spin model for monolayer-bilayer phase transitions in silver-based honeycomb layered materials, we propose that the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems correspond to both the infinite-channel Feshbach resonance widths of a (Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein/etc.) condensate in 2 dimensions, and equivalently to the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising model of two pseudo-spins with a partition function corresponding to a class of functions that must include the Riemann Xi function. Identifying the quantum-mechanical operator that yields the discontinuous/random/topological spectrum of the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems offers a tenable realisation of the Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture.</description>

      <title>Near complete laser-induced modulation of the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase fraction in FeRh films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten microns squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations ($dR/dT$, thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency $f$ is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90% with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrode morphology critically determines the stability and efficiency of lithium metal anodes, yet no predictive framework has explained how measurable parameters control deposition. Here we introduce the first theoretical model of electrochemical Ostwald ripening, capturing the competition between electroplating and surface-energy-driven redistribution and identifying it as the governing process behind morphology evolution in the non-dendritic regime. The framework explicitly incorporates SEI resistance, electrolyte conductivity, electrode wettability, and current density revealing the transition from 2D SEI-limited to 3D electrolyte-limited growth. The model yields analytical expressions for nucleus size, density and distribution that quantitatively reproduce independent experimental results and establishes a direct link between plating conditions, morphology, and Coulombic efficiency. By providing experimentally accessible relationships between key parameters and deposition outcomes, the framework enables predictive understanding of lithium plating and provides a broadly applicable basis for controlling electrodeposition morphology across diverse electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Tip-Based Proximity Ferroelectric Switching and Piezoelectric Response in Wurtzite Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an external field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically switchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of "proximity switching" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of "proximity suppression" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the "otherwise unswitchable" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of zero-dimensional topological states in ultranarrow germanene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible, all-electric control of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional modes has been a long-standing goal. In buckled honeycomb lattices, a perpendicular field couples to the staggered sublattice potential providing the required handle. We combine scanning tunneling microscopy and tight-binding theory to switch zero-dimensional topological end states reversibly on and off in ultranarrow germanene nanoribbons by tuning the electric field in the tunnel junction. Increasing the field switches off the end modes of topological two-hexagon wide ribbons, while the same field switches on zero-dimensional states in initially trivial three- and four-hexagon wide ribbons. This atomic scale platform realizes a proof-of-principle for a zero-dimensional topological field effect device, opening a path for ultrasmall memory, controllable qubits, and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio density-functional calculations show that orthorhombic Pca21 hafnia HfO2 mixed with vanadium at low concentration is a ferroelectric and ferromagnetic insulator. The multiorbital degeneracy of singly-occupied V states in the nominally 4+ ionic state is broken by magnetism, reduced symmetry, and local distortion, causing a single one-electron majority state per V atom to be occupied. A gap of order 1 eV thus survives at all V concentrations, and intrinsic polarization is preserved, at the level of two-thirds the hafnia value. Ferromagnetic magnetization is found to increase linearly with V content, with values of 30-40 emu/cm3 at concentrations near the end of the stability range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Theory of Five- and Six-Phonon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculations reveal dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si even at high temperatures, they become increasingly important in MgO near its melting point (3100~K) and in BaO at intermediate temperatures (1200~K). Most remarkably, five- and six-phonon scatterings surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity in BaO near its melting point (2100~K), reducing lattice thermal conductivity by over 50\%. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work provides theoretical insights into the lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures (down to 2 K), outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements along with microstructural and compositional analyses, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of single-crystalline CoSn (10-10) kagome metal thin films for interconnect applications: structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CoSn kagome metal is a pseudo-one-dimensional electronic conductor, exhibiting low resistivity (\r{ho}) along the [0001] direction (c-axis) and significantly higher \r{ho} along other crystallographic directions. Such anisotropic conduction is expected to mitigate resistivity increases in narrow interconnect wires at advanced semiconductor technology process nodes, making CoSn a promising candidate for future interconnect applications. In this study, CoSn thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering, and their resistivity anisotropy was investigated with respect to crystallographic orientation. Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 {\deg}C. The CoSn films exhibited relatively low \r{ho} along [0001], reaching 13 micro{\Omega} cm for films thickner than 50 nm, and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of \r{ho} between [0001] and [2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with previous reports on bulk CoSn single crystals. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness, attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, which hinders accurate evaluation of the thickness dependence of resistivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. These results highlight both the potential and challenges of employing CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetic and Electronic Properties of Double Perovskite La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$ double perovskite series serves as an effective platform for investigating the evolution of magnetic and electronic properties as a function of chemical pressure (doping) or hydrostatic pressure due to the interplay between the electrons correlation and spin-orbit coupling. In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\% for $x =$ 0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 100 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We have created an innovative natural thermostat algorithm to mimic the direct impact of temperature on interatomic distances in both a perfect crystal and a system containing a vacancy. Unlike previous research, our findings demonstrate that in a system with a defect, the radii of the initial ten coordination spheres increase almost linearly with temperature. However, the coefficients defining these dependencies, unlike those for interatomic distances farther from the vacancy, do not equal the linear thermal expansion coefficient of the perfect crystal. Knowing the atomic coordinates and their temperature evolution, we calculated the temperature dependence of the vacancy formation energy and the vacancy relaxation volume in bcc iron. The significance of these effects for the accurate calculation of atomic diffusion coefficients is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme electron-ion non-equilibrium states, generated by ultrafast laser excitation, lead to melting processes that are fundamentally different from those under conventional thermal equilibrium and remain not fully understood. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as critical to heterogeneous phase transformations. This nonthermal expansion generates a density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures, creating electronic pressure-driven solid-liquid interface propagation at a high speed of 2500 m/s -- tenfold faster than that of thermal heterogeneous melting mechanisms. Simulated time-resolved X-ray diffraction signatures distinguish this nonthermal expansion from thermal expansion dynamics driven by thermoelastic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, extending the applicability of classical dynamics to the challenging case of gapless excitations. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions for uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Entanglement witnesses derived from the quantum-equivalent DSSF act as sensitive diagnostics for the quantum-to-classical crossover. Their reliability stems from their dependence on spectral features alone, enabling classical dynamics to emulate quantum thresholds without genuine entanglement. This framework also reproduces transverse spin correlations in finite magnetic fields, in agreement with quantum simulations. Together, our results establish quantum-corrected classical dynamics as a scalable and predictive tool for interpreting scattering experiments and exploring quantum correlations in strongly correlated spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is a key concept in condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a probe of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a multipolar phonon, a three-dimensional and alternating displacement resembling the chiral phonon, plays a vital role in the proposed optical phenomena. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>
