      <title>Quality of Descriptive Information on Cultural Heritage Objects: Definition and Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective data processing depends on the quality of the underlying data. However, quality issues such as inconsistencies and uncertainties, can significantly impede the processing and subsequent use of data. Despite the centrality of data quality to a wide range of computational tasks, there is currently no broadly accepted, domain-independent consensus on the definition of data quality. Existing frameworks primarily define data quality in ways that are tailored to specific domains, data types, or contexts of use. Although quality assessment frameworks exist for specific domains, such as electronic health record data and linked data, corresponding approaches for descriptive information about cultural heritage objects remain underdeveloped. Moreover, existing quality definitions are often theoretical in nature and lack empirical validation based on real-world data problems. In this paper, we address these limitations by first defining a set of quality dimensions specifically designed to capture the characteristics of descriptive information about cultural heritage objects. Our definition is based on an in-depth analysis of existing dimensions and is illustrated through domain-specific examples. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our proposed quality definition using a curated set of real-world data quality problems from the cultural heritage domain. This empirical evaluation substantiates our definition of data quality, resulting in a comprehensive definition of data quality in this domain.</description>

      <title>Bridging Through Absence: How Comeback Researchers Bridge Knowledge Gaps Through Structural Re-emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21926</link>

Abstract: Understanding the role of researchers who return to academia after prolonged inactivity, termed "comeback researchers", is crucial for developing inclusive models of scientific careers. This study investigates the structural and semantic behaviors of comeback researchers, focusing on their role in cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and network reintegration. Using the AMiner citation dataset, we analyze 113,637 early-career researchers and identify 1,425 comeback cases based on a three-year-or-longer publication gap followed by renewed activity. We find that comeback researchers cite 126% more distinct communities and exhibit 7.6% higher bridging scores compared to dropouts. They also demonstrate 74% higher gap entropy, reflecting more irregular yet strategically impactful publication trajectories. Predictive models trained on these bridging- and entropy-based features achieve a 97% ROC-AUC, far outperforming the 54% ROC-AUC of baseline models using traditional metrics like publication count and h-index. Finally, we substantiate these results via a multi-lens validation. These findings highlight the unique contributions of comeback researchers and offer data-driven tools for their early identification and institutional support.</description>

      <title>Behind the Byline: A Large-Scale Study of Scientific Author Contributions</title>

Abstract: Understanding how co-authors distribute credit is critical for accurately assessing scholarly collaboration. In this study, we uncover the implicit structures within scientific teamwork by systematically analyzing author contributions across a large corpus of research publications. We introduce a computational framework designed to convert free-text contribution statements into 14 standardized CRediT categories, identifying clear and consistent positional patterns in task assignments. By analyzing over 400,000 scientific articles from prominent sources such as PLOS One and Nature, we extracted and standardized more than 5.6 million author-task assignments corresponding to 1.58 million author mentions. Our analysis reveals substantial disparities in workload distribution. Notably, in small teams with three co-authors, the most engaged contributor performs over three times more tasks than the least engaged, a disparity that grows linearly with team size. This demonstrates a consistent pattern of central and peripheral roles within modern collaborative teams. Moreover, our analysis shows distinct positional biases in task allocation: technical responsibilities, such as software development and formal analysis, broadly fall to authors positioned earlier in the author list, whereas managerial tasks, including supervision and funding acquisition, increasingly concentrate among authors positioned toward the end. This gradient underscores a significant division of labor, where early-listed authors mainly undertake most hands-on activities. In contrast, senior authors mostly assume roles involving leadership and oversight. Our findings highlight the structured and hierarchical organization within scholarly collaborations, providing deeper insights into the specific roles and dynamics that govern academic teamwork</description>
