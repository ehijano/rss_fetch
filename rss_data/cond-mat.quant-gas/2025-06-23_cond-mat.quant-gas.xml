      <title>Normal modes and shockwaves in cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods are developed to simulate the dynamics of atoms in a Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT), based on the fluid description of ultracold gases under laser cooling and magnetic trapping forces. With this model, equilibrium hydrostatic profiles and normal modes are calculated, and numerical results are validated against theoretical predictions. As a test case, shock wave formation due to rapid gas expansion and contraction of the ultracold gas is simulated. The latter is caused by a sudden change of the value of its effective collective charge. Limitations of the current methods and future improvements are discussed. This work provides a foundation for studying numerically complex MOT behaviors and their use as analog simulators for astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization Control via Magnetic Field in Dissipative Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering spin polarization in dissipative bosonic systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum metrology and space-based quantum simulations. This work demonstrates precise magnetic moment control in multicomponent Bose gases during evaporative cooling via tailored magnetic fields. By adjusting the magnetic field gradients, null point position, and duration, we selectively tune evaporation rates of magnetic sublevels, achieving targeted spin polarization. Theoretical models, validated by numerical simulations and Stern-Gerlach experiments, reveal how magnetic fields reshape trapping potentials and spin-dependent dissipation. The results establish a dissipative spin-selection mechanism governing polarization evolution in evaporatively cooled Bose gases and provide a framework for engineering spin-polarized quantum states.</description>

      <title>Four-body physics in low-dimensional bosons with three-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-channel model for bosons with the three-body interaction is proposed. Similar to the Hamiltonian describing narrow Feshbach resonance in the two-body sector, our model includes the finite-range effects of the three-body potential and is well-defined in the ultraviolet (UV). A detailed exploration of the Efimov-like effect in the fractal-dimension system of four bosons is carried out. Peculiarities of the four-body bound states and the low-energy atom-trimer scattering in one dimension are revealed.</description>

      <title>Probing universal phase diagram of dimensional crossover with an atomic quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality is a fundamental concept in physics, which plays a hidden but crucial role in various domains, including condensed matter physics, relativity and string theory, statistical physics, etc. In quantum physics, reducing dimensionality usually enhances fluctuations and leads to novel properties. Owing to these effects, quantum simulators in which dimensionality can be controlled have emerged as a new area of interest. However, such a platform has only been studied in specific regimes and a universal phase diagram is lacking. Here, we produce an interacting atomic quantum simulator with continuous tunability of anisotropy and temperature, and probe the universal phase diagram of dimensional crossover. At low temperatures, we identify the regimes from quantum three to zero dimensions. By increasing temperature, we observe the non-trivial emergence of a thermal regime situated between the quantum zero and integer dimensions. We show that the quantum-to thermal transition falls into four different universality classes depending on the dimensionality. Surprisingly, we also detect a fifth type where the high-dimensional quantum system can reach the thermal phase by crossing a low-dimensional quantum regime. Our results provide a crucial foundation for understanding the projective condensed matter structures in unconventional dimensions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.</description>

      <title>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked tetratomic molecules (FL tetramers) to deeper bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Polaronic dressing of bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of 2D moir\'e materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moir\'e potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moir\'e-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moir\'e potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moir\'e potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moir\'e strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.</description>

      <title>Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>Entangled states from sparsely coupled spins for metrology with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10010</link>

Abstract: Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20593</link>

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</description>
