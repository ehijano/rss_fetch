      <title>Hysteretic response to different modes of ramping an external field in sparse and dense Ising spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hysteretic behavior of Ising spin glasses at $T=0$ for various modes of driving. Previous studies mostly focused on an infinitely slow speed $\dot{H}$ by which the external field $H$ was ramped to trigger avalanches of spin flips by starting with destabilizing a single spin while few have focused on the effect of different driving methods. First, we show that this conventional protocol imposes a system size dependence. Then, we numerically analyze the response of Ising spin glasses at rates $\dot{H}$ that are fixed as well, to elucidate the differences in the response. Specifically, we compare three different modes of ramping ($\dot{H}=c/N$, $\dot{H}=c/\sqrt{N}$, and $\dot{H}=c$ for constant $c$) for two types of spin glass systems of size $N$, representing dense networks by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and sparse networks by the lattice spin glass in $d=3$ dimensions known as the Edwards Anderson model. Depending on the mode of ramping, we find that the response of each system, in form of spin-flip avalanches and other observables, can vary considerably. In particular, in the $N$-independent mode applied to the lattice spin glass, which is closest to experimental reality, we observe a percolation transition with a broad avalanche distribution between phases of localized and system-spanning responses. We explore implications for combinatorial optimization problems pertaining to sparse systems.</description>

      <title>First return times on sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Elastic electron scattering and localization in a chain with isotopic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study elastic electron scattering and localization by ubiquitous isotopic disorder in one-dimensional systems appearing due to interaction with phonon modes localized at isotope impurities. By using a tight-binding model with intersite hopping matrix element dependent on the interatomic distance, we find mass-dependent backscattering probability by single and pairs of isotopic impurities. For the pairs, in addition to the mass, the distance between the isotopes plays the critical role. Single impurities effectively attract electrons and can produce localized weakly bound electron states. In the presence of disorder, the electron free path at positive energies becomes finite and the corresponding Anderson localization at the spatial scale greatly exceeding the distance between the impurities becomes possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of $k$-local quantum chains subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment, which exhibits "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert space fragmented phases as charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages": local regions across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. We prove that this implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov sectors that each form an exponentially-vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically-disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical states at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement scaling, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" states featuring non-area-law scaling. We then numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We also study the critical scaling of the dimensions of various Krylov sectors at $\nu=\nu_c$, as well as investigate the properties of certain special case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Non-linear classification capability of quantum neural networks due to emergent quantum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power and expressivity of deep classical neural networks can be attributed to non-linear input-output relations. Such non-linearities are at the heart of many computational tasks, such as data classification and pattern recognition. Quantum neural networks, on the other hand, are necessarily linear as they process information via unitary operations. Here we show that effective non-linearities can be implemented in these platforms by exploiting the relationship between information processing and many-body quantum dynamics. The crucial point is that quantum many-body systems can show emergent collective behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions, which leads to an effectively non-linear dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In the context of quantum neural networks, which are necessarily finite, this translates into metastability with transient non-ergodic behavior. By using a quantum neural network whose architecture is inspired by dissipative many-body quantum spin models, we show that this mechanism indeed allows to realize non-linear data classification, despite the underlying dynamics being local and linear. Our proof-of-principle study may pave the way for the systematic construction of quantum neural networks with emergent non-linear properties.</description>
