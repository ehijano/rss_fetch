      <title>Optimal strategies for low-noise detection of atoms using resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy in cold atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy has been used as a highly-sensitive method for measuring the output of cold-atom interferometers. Using a detailed model that accounts for optical saturation, spatially-varying intensities and atomic densities, and radiation pressure on the atoms, we theoretically investigate under what parameter regimes the optimum signal-to-noise ratio is found under experimentally realistic conditions. We compare this technique to the standard method of fluorescence imaging and find that it outperforms fluorescence imaging for compact interferometers using condensed atomic sources or where the photon collection efficiency is limited. However, we find that fluorescence imaging is likely to be the preferred method when using squeezed atomic sources due to limited atom number.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of rotationally cold ArH$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally studied dissociative recombination (DR) of electronically and vibrationally relaxed ArH$^+$ in its lowest rotational levels, using an electron--ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic Storage Ring. We report measurements for the merged-beams rate coefficient of ArH$^+$ and compare it to published experimental and theoretical results. In addition, by measuring the kinetic energy released to the DR fragments, we have determined the internal state of the DR products after dissociation. At low collision energies, we find that the atomic products are in their respective ground states, which are only accessible via non-adiabatic couplings to neutral Rydberg states. Published theoretical results for ArH$^+$ have not included this DR pathway. From our measurements, we have also derived a kinetic temperature rate coefficient for use in astrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature 617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic and nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron transition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.05\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from tenths to approximately $6\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental studies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent verification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited generalized measurement for tunnel-coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient readout of the relevant information is pivotal for quantum simulation experiments. Often only single observables are accessed by performing standard projective measurements. In this work, we implement a generalized measurement scheme based on controlled outcoupling of atoms. This gives us simultaneous access to number imbalance and relative phase in a system of two tunnel-coupled 1D Bose gases, which realize a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. We demonstrate that our measurement is quantum limited by accessing number squeezing and show that we can track Josephson oscillation dynamics with the generalized measurements. Finally, we show that the scheme allows the extraction of atoms while maintaining the system's coherent dynamics, which opens up the door to accessing multi-time correlation functions. Our scheme constitutes a step towards accessing quantum properties of the sine-Gordon field theory and, in the future, studying spatially extended systems under continuous monitoring.</description>

      <title>Atomic fluorescence collection into planar photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

      <title>Laser Resonance Chromatography of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ in He: an ab initio investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a laser resonance chromatography (LRC) experiment on $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$, with the goal of detecting the ion's electronic ground $5f$ $^2$F$_{5/2}$ state and metastable $7s$ $^2$S$_{1/2}$ state by means of their ion mobilities. To this end, we first model the ion-neutral interaction potentials for the two electronic states with a relativistic Fock space coupled cluster method and complete basis-set extrapolation scheme. The interaction potentials are used to simulate the state-specific reduced ion mobilities in terms of the operating temperature and the external electric field. The ion mobilities differ by more than 7% at 300 K and moderate field strengths; thus, separation of the $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ metastable state lies within the reach of LRC experiments targeting optical probing and monitoring of the nuclear clock transition in this isotope.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magnetically silent optically pumped magnetometers for the TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.5 pT/rtHz at 1~Hz and a stability of 90 fT over 150 seconds of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications. Novel aspects of the system include commercial construction and the ability to operate up to 24 sensors on a single probe laser diode.</description>
