      <title>Making Symmetry Explicit: The Limits of Sophistication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is often treated in philosophy of physics as an interpretive problem. A particularly lively dispute concerns local symmetries: do they indicate surplus structure that ought to be expunged, or are they merely a harmless redundancy? One influential response favours the second option for certain theories -- those dubbed internally sophisticated. And indeed, in much of physics practice, local symmetries are left implicit: one simply works "up to isomorphism'' without pausing over invariance. But not always. In some settings, local symmetry and invariance become pressing practical concerns for physicists. Yet philosophical discussions of sophistication have paid little sustained attention to when, and why, this happens.
  Surveying textbook general relativity (GR) and gauge theory, I identify the settings in which diffeomorphism invariance or gauge invariance must be handled explicitly. (Here a setting is a choice of representational framework or background assumptions within which one formulates and uses the theory -- for instance, linearisation, an initial-value formulation, or a Hamiltonian $3+1$ formalism.) I propose an operational criterion -- background-relative sophistication (BRS) -- and argue that it accounts well for the pattern: it marks just where symmetry can stay implicit and where it must be made explicit. Quantum and subsystem settings raise a further difficulty: there, certain tasks (superposition and gluing) force symmetry into view even for theories that are BRS.</description>

      <title>A Huygens-Leibniz-Lange framework for classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss the physical basis of classical mechanics, such as expressed commonly using the framework of Newton's Principia. Newton's formulation of the laws of motion is seen to have quite a few ambiguities and shortcomings. Therefore I offer an alternative set of laws, based in particular on ideas of his contemporaries Huygens and Leibniz with a crucial addition by Ludwig Lange, which avoids the problems with Newton's formulation. It is shown that from these laws of motion all the usual results of classical mechanics, as it concerns the motion of idealized point masses, can be rederived. The application of these principles to relativistic point particles is discussed.</description>

      <title>The road of quantum entanglement: from Einstein to 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the achievements that were awarded 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, as well as the preceding and the later developments. The main notions and historic cornerstones of Bell inequalities, the related researches on quantum entanglement are reviewed, and the key physical ideas are emphasized. Among the early work, C. S. Wu's contributions using polarization-entangled photons from electron-positron annihilation are introduced.</description>

      <title>Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13520v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Th\'{e}orie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.</description>
