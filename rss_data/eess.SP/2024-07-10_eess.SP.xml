      <title>Soli-enabled Noncontact Heart Rate Detection for Sleep and Meditation Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) is a crucial physiological signal that can be used to monitor health and fitness. Traditional methods for measuring HR require wearable devices, which can be inconvenient or uncomfortable, especially during sleep and meditation. Noncontact HR detection methods employing microwave radar can be a promising alternative. However, the existing approaches in the literature usually use high-gain antennas and require the sensor to face the user's chest or back, making them difficult to integrate into a portable device and unsuitable for sleep and meditation tracking applications. This study presents a novel approach for noncontact HR detection using a miniaturized Soli radar chip embedded in a portable device (Google Nest Hub). The chip has a $6.5 \mbox{ mm} \times 5 \mbox{ mm} \times 0.9 \mbox{ mm}$ dimension and can be easily integrated into various devices. The proposed approach utilizes advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to extract HRs from radar signals. The approach is validated on a sleep dataset (62 users, 498 hours) and a meditation dataset (114 users, 1131 minutes). The approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of $1.69$ bpm and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of $2.67\%$ on the sleep dataset. On the meditation dataset, the approach achieves an MAE of $1.05$ bpm and a MAPE of $1.56\%$. The recall rates for the two datasets are $88.53\%$ and $98.16\%$, respectively. This study represents the first application of the noncontact HR detection technology to sleep and meditation tracking, offering a promising alternative to wearable devices for HR monitoring during sleep and meditation.</description>

      <title>Fast Signal Interpolation Through Zero-padding and FFT/IFFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the sampling theorem, interpolation should be conducted by employing the sinc functions as the kernels. Inspired by the fact that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is sampled from the discrete time Fourier transform, a fast signal interpolation algorithm based on zero-padding and fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) is presented. This algorithm gives a good approximate of the ideal interpolation, in spite of the windowing effect. The fundamental difference of this algorithm and the ideal sinc interpolation is unveiled, and shown to be deeply rooted in the connection of the sinc function and the Dirichlet function.</description>

      <title>RS-BNN: A Deep Learning Framework for the Optimal Beamforming Design of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) relies on beamforming design for attaining spectral efficiency and energy efficiency gains over traditional multiple access schemes. While conventional optimization approaches such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) achieve suboptimal solutions for RSMA beamforming optimization, they are computationally demanding. A novel approach based on fractional programming (FP) has unveiled the optimal beamforming structure (OBS) for RSMA. This method, combined with a hyperplane fixed point iteration (HFPI) approach, named FP-HFPI, provides suboptimal beamforming solutions with identical sum rate performance but much lower computational complexity compared to WMMSE. Inspired by such an approach, in this work, a novel deep unfolding framework based on FP-HFPI, named rate-splitting-beamforming neural network (RS-BNN), is proposed to unfold the FP-HFPI algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed RS-BNN attains a level of performance closely matching that of WMMSE and FP-HFPI, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Optimizers for Fault Isolation and Diagnostics of Control Rod Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the optimization of fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) in the Control Rod Drive System (CRDS) of GE-Hitachi's BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR), focusing on the electrically powered fine motion control rod drive (FMCRD) servomotors. Leveraging the coordinated motion of multiple FMCRDs for control rod adjustments, the study proposes a deep learning approach, utilizing one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN)-based autoencoders for anomaly detection and encoder-decoder structured 1D CNN classifiers for fault classification. Simulink models simulate normal and fault operations, monitoring electric current and electromagnetic torque. The training of the fault isolation and fault classification models is optimized. Various optimizers, including Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Nesterov Adam (Nadam), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), are evaluated, with Nadam demonstrating a relatively superior performance across the isolation and classification tasks due to its adaptive gradient and Nesterov components. The research underscores the importance of considering the number of runs (each run has a different set of initial model parameters) as a hyperparameter during empirical optimizer comparisons and contributes insights crucial for enhancing FDD in SMR control systems and for the application of 1D CNN to FDD.</description>

      <title>Off-grid Channel Estimation for Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Using Grid Refinement and Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing (ODDM) has been recently proposed as a promising multicarrier modulation scheme to tackle Doppler spread in high-mobility environments. Accurate channel estimation is of paramount importance to guarantee reliable communication for the ODDM, especially when the delays and Dopplers of the propagation paths are off-grid. In this paper, we propose a novel grid refinement and adjustment-based sparse Bayesian inference (GRASBI) scheme for DD domain channel estimation. The GRASBI involves first formulating the channel estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery through the introduction of a virtual DD grid. Then, an iterative process is proposed that involves (i) sparse Bayesian learning to estimate the channel parameters and (ii) a novel grid refinement and adjustment process to adjust the virtual grid points. The grid adjustment in GRASBI relies on the maximum likelihood principle to attain the adjustment and utilizes refined grids that have much higher resolution than the virtual grid. Moreover, a low-complexity grid refinement and adjustment-based channel estimation scheme is proposed, that can provides a good tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and the complexity. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed channel estimation schemes.</description>

      <title>UAV Formation and Resource Allocation Optimization for Communication-Assisted 3D InSAR Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation and resource allocation optimization for communication-assisted three-dimensional (3D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing. We consider a system consisting of two UAVs that perform bistatic interferometric SAR (InSAR) sensing for generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) and transmit the radar raw data to a ground station (GS) in real time. To account for practical 3D sensing requirements, we use non-conventional sensing performance metrics, such as the SAR interferometric coherence, i.e., the local cross-correlation between the two co-registered UAV SAR images, the point-to-point InSAR relative height error, and the height of ambiguity, which together characterize the accuracy with which the InSAR system can determine the height of ground targets. Our objective is to jointly optimize the UAV formation, speed, and communication power allocation for maximization of the InSAR coverage while satisfying energy, communication, and InSAR-specific sensing constraints. To solve the formulated non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem, we divide it into three sub-problems and propose a novel alternating optimization (AO) framework that is based on classical, monotonic, and stochastic optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive simulations and compared to several benchmark schemes. Furthermore, our simulation results highlight the impact of the UAV-GS communication link on the flying formation and sensing performance and show that the DEM of a large area of interest can be mapped and offloaded to ground successfully, while the ground topography can be estimated with centimeter-scale precision. Lastly, we demonstrate that a low UAV velocity is preferable for InSAR applications as it leads to better sensing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, performance of an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) scenario is evaluated, in which a vehicle simultaneously detects the next vehicle ahead while receiving a communication signal from a RoadSide Unit (RSU) of the infrastructure. Univariate and joint radar and communication performance metrics are evaluated within three different frameworks, namely the Stochastic Geometry (SG), Monte-Carlo (MC), and Ray-Tracing (RT) frameworks. The parameters of the system model are extracted from the RT simulations, and the metrics are compared to assess the accuracy of the SG framework. It is shown that the SG and MC system models are relevant w.r.t. RT simulations for the evaluation of univariate communication and sensing metrics, but larger discrepancies are observed for the joint metrics.</description>

      <title>Learning From Crowdsourced Noisy Labels: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotator-produced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing -- showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and regression in the presence of outliers in data by applying low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition. For multivariate data corrupted with outliers, it is generally hard to estimate the true low dimensional manifold from corrupted data. The objective of the proposed framework is to find a robust estimate of the low dimensional space of data to reliably perform regression. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated experimentally for simultaneous regression and dimensionality reduction in the presence of outliers in data.</description>

      <title>HiSAC: High-Resolution Sensing with Multiband Communication Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC ) systems are expected to perform accurate radar sensing while having minimal impact on communication. Ideally, sensing should only reuse communication resources, especially for spectrum which is contended by many applications. However, this poses a great challenge in that communication systems often operate on narrow subbands with low sensing resolution. Combining contiguous subbands has shown significant resolution gain in active localization. However, multiband ISAC remains unexplored due to communication subbands being highly sparse (non-contiguous) and affected by phase offsets that prevent their aggregation (incoherent). To tackle these problems, we design HiSAC, the first multiband ISAC system that combines diverse subbands across a wide frequency range to achieve super-resolved passive ranging. To solve the non-contiguity and incoherence of subbands, HiSAC combines them progressively, exploiting an anchor propagation path between transmitter and receiver in an optimization problem to achieve phase coherence. HiSAC fully reuses pilot signals in communication systems, it applies to different frequencies and can combine diverse technologies, e.g., 5G-NR and WiGig. We implement HiSAC on an experimental platform in the millimeter-wave unlicensed band and test it on objects and humans. Our results show it enhances the sensing resolution by up to 20 times compared to single-band processing while occupying the same spectrum.</description>

      <title>Garment suggestion based on comfort extracted from physiological and emotional parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the study was to find the true comfort of the wearer by conceptualizing, formulating, and proving the relation between physiological and emotional parameters with clothing fit and fabric. A mixed-method research design was used, and the findings showed that physiological indicators such as heart rate are closely linked with user comfort. However, a significant change in emotional response indicated a definite relationship between different fabric and fit types. The research was conducted to discover the relation between true comfort parameters and clothing, which is unique to the field. The findings help us understand how fabric types and clothing fit types can affect physiological and emotional responses, providing the consumer with satisfactory clothing with the suitable properties needed.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss our vision for neuromorphic accelerators based on integrated photonics within the framework of the Horizon Europe NEUROPULS project. Augmented integrated photonic architectures that leverage phase-change and III-V materials for optical computing will be presented. A CMOS-compatible platform will be discussed that integrates these materials to fabricate photonic neuromorphic architectures, along with a gem5-based simulation platform to model accelerator operation once it is interfaced with a RISC-V processor. This simulation platform enables accurate system-level accelerator modeling and benchmarking in terms of key metrics such as speed, energy consumption, and footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goals of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) include high spatial and temporal resolutions with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To simultaneously improve spatial and temporal resolutions and maintain the high SNR advantage of OSSI, we present novel pipelines for fast acquisition and high-resolution fMRI reconstruction and physics parameter quantification. We propose a patch-tensor low-rank model, a physics-based manifold model, and a voxel-wise attention network. With novel models for acquisition and reconstruction, we demonstrate that we can improve SNR and resolution simultaneously without compromising scan time. All the proposed models outperform other comparison approaches with higher resolution and more functional information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing super-resolution ultrasound localisation through multi-frame deconvolution exploiting spatiotemporal coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound imaging through microbubble (MB) localisation and tracking, also known as ultrasound localisation microscopy, allows non-invasive sub-diffraction resolution imaging of microvasculature in animals and humans. The number of MBs localised from the acquired contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images and the localisation precision directly influence the quality of the resulting super-resolution microvasculature images. However, non-negligible noise present in the CEUS images can make localising MBs challenging. To enhance the MB localisation performance, we propose a Multi-Frame Deconvolution (MF-Decon) framework that can exploit the spatiotemporal coherence inherent in the CEUS data, with new spatial and temporal regularisers designed based on total variation (TV) and regularisation by denoising (RED). Based on the MF-Decon framework, we introduce two novel methods: MF-Decon with spatial and temporal TVs (MF-Decon+3DTV) and MF-Decon with spatial RED and temporal TV (MF-Decon+RED+TV). Results from in silico simulations indicate that our methods outperform two widely used methods using deconvolution or normalised cross-correlation across all evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, $F_1$ score, mean and standard localisation errors. In particular, our methods improve MB localisation precision by up to 39% and recall by up to 12%. Super-resolution microvasculature maps generated with our methods on a publicly available in vivo rat brain dataset show less noise, better contrast, higher resolution and more vessel structures.</description>

      <title>Effects of Small-Scale User Mobility on Highly Directional XR Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of next-generation communication systems promises to enable extended reality (XR) applications, such as XR gaming with ultra-realistic content and human-grade sensory feedback. These demanding applications impose stringent performance requirements on the underlying wireless communication infrastructure. To meet the expected Quality of Experience (QoE) for XR applications, high-capacity connections are necessary, which can be achieved by using millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands and employing highly directional beams. However, these narrow beams are susceptible to even minor misalignments caused by small-scale user mobility, such as changes in the orientation of the XR head-mounted device (HMD) or minor shifts in user body position. This article explores the impact of small-scale user mobility on mmWave connectivity for XR and reviews approaches to resolve the challenges arising due to small-scale mobility. To deepen our understanding of small-scale mobility during XR usage, we prepared a dataset of user mobility during XR gaming. We use this dataset to study the effects of user mobility on highly directional communication, identifying specific aspects of user mobility that significantly affect the performance of narrow-beam wireless communication systems. Our results confirm the substantial influence of small-scale mobility on beam misalignment, highlighting the need for enhanced mechanisms to effectively manage the consequences of small-scale mobility.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing combines the power of convex optimization techniques with a sparsity-inducing prior on the signal space to solve an underdetermined system of equations. For many problems, the sparsifying dictionary is not directly given, nor its existence can be assumed. Besides, the sensing matrix can change across different scenarios. Addressing these issues requires solving a sparse representation learning problem, namely dictionary learning, taking into account the epistemic uncertainty of the learned dictionaries and, finally, jointly learning sparse representations and reconstructions under varying sensing matrix conditions. We address both concerns by proposing a variant of the LISTA architecture. First, we introduce Augmented Dictionary Learning ISTA (A-DLISTA), which incorporates an augmentation module to adapt parameters to the current measurement setup. Then, we propose to learn a distribution over dictionaries via a variational approach, dubbed Variational Learning ISTA (VLISTA). VLISTA exploits A-DLISTA as the likelihood model and approximates a posterior distribution over the dictionaries as part of an unfolded LISTA-based recovery algorithm. As a result, VLISTA provides a probabilistic way to jointly learn the dictionary distribution and the reconstruction algorithm with varying sensing matrices. We provide theoretical and experimental support for our architecture and show that our model learns calibrated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>OFDM Achieves the Lowest Ranging Sidelobe Under Random ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Resource Allocation in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations into 5G and Beyond is essential to achieve truly global connectivity. A distinctive characteristic of LEO mega-constellations is that they constitute a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, which enables the pre-planned allocation of the radio resources. However, the different bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies. Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we present an ISAC framework and frame structure to accurately estimate the attenuation in the communication links due to precipitation, with the aim of finding the optimal serving satellites and resource allocation for downlink communication with users on ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and the fairness by 600% when compared to solving these problems separately.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness and Security in ISAC Network Design: Leveraging Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface transceiver-enhanced robust and secure integrated sensing and communication network. A time-division sensing communication mechanism is designed for the scenario, which enables communication and sensing to share wireless resources. To address the interference management problem and hinder eavesdropping, we implement rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where the common stream is designed as a useful signal and an artificial noise, while taking into account the imperfect channel state information and modeling the channel for the illegal users in a fine-grained manner as well as giving an upper bound on the error. We introduce the secrecy outage probability and construct an optimization problem with secrecy sum-rate as the objective functions to optimize the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix and the timeslot duration variable. Due to the coupling of the optimization variables and the infinity of the error set, the proposed problem is a nonconvex optimization problem that cannot be solved directly. In order to address the above challenges, the block coordinate descent-based second-order cone programming algorithm is used to decouple the optimization variables and solving the problem. Specifically, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems concerning the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix, and the timeslot duration variable, which are solved by alternating optimization until convergence is reached. To solve the problem, S-procedure, Bernstein's inequality and successive convex approximation are employed to deal with the objective function and non-convex constraints. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the secrecy energy efficiency and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao boundary.</description>

      <title>Revealing the evanescent components in Kronecker-product based codebooks: insights and implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orthogonal bases of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been recognized as the standard spatial-domain bases for Type I, Type II and enhanced Type II codewords by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). For uniform planar arrays, these spatial-domain bases are derived as the Kronecker product of one-dimensional DFT bases. Theoretically, each spatial basis corresponds to a beam directed towards a specific angle of departure and the set of bases represent the orthogonal beams that cover the front hemisphere of an array. While the Kronecker-product based precoding scheme facilitates the concise indexing of a codeword in the codebooks through precoding matrix indicators (PMIs) in channel state information feedback, it introduces redundant spatial beams characterized by high spatial-frequency components. This paper investigates the presence of codewords representing high spatial-frequency components within the Kronecker-product based codebooks. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we confirm the redundancy of these codewords in MIMO communications, advocating for their removal from the codebooks to enhance system performance. Several topics relevant to the high spatial components are also involved in the discussion. Practical suggestions regarding future standard design are provided based on our theoretical analysis and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Gaunt coefficients for complex and real spherical harmonics with applications to spherical array processing and Ambisonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustical signal processing of directional representations of sound fields, including source, receiver, and scatterer transfer functions, are often expressed and modeled in the spherical harmonic domain (SHD). Certain such modeling operations, or applications of those models, involve multiplications of those directional quantities, which can also be expressed conveniently in the SHD through coupling coefficients known as Gaunt coefficients. Since the definition and notation of Gaunt coefficients varies across acoustical publications, this work defines them based on established conventions of complex and real spherical harmonics (SHs) along with a convenient matrix form for spherical multiplication of directionally band-limited spherical functions. Additionally, the report provides a derivation of the Gaunt coefficients for real SHs, which has been missing from the literature and can be used directly in spatial audio frameworks such as Ambisonics. Matlab code is provided that can compute all coefficients up to user specified SH orders. Finally, a number of relevant acoustical processing examples from the literature are presented, following the matrix formalism of coefficients introduced in the report.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Fair STAR-RIS for Mobile Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to improve the energy efficiency and fairness of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) for mobile users, ensuring reduced power consumption while maintaining reliable communication. To achieve this, we introduce a new parameter known as the subsurface assignment variable, which determines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user. We then formulate a novel optimization problem by concurrently optimizing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and subsurface assignment variable. We leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to address this optimization problem. The DRL model predicts the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and efficiently allocates elements of STAR-RIS to the users. Additionally, we incorporate a penalty term in the DRL model to facilitate intelligent deactivation of STAR-RIS elements when not in use to enhance energy efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method can achieve fairly high and nearly equal data rates for all users in both the transmission and reflection spaces in an energy-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Identity-enabled CDMA LiDAR for massively parallel ranging with a single-element receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06918v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as a crucial tool for high-resolution 3D imaging, particularly in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, and augmented reality. However, the increasing demand for faster acquisition speed and higher resolution in LiDAR systems has highlighted the limitations of traditional mechanical scanning methods. This study introduces a novel wavelength-multiplexed code-division multiple access (CDMA) parallel laser ranging approach with a single-pixel receiver to address these challenges. By leveraging the unique properties of Gold-sequences in a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) framework, our design enables comprehensive parallelization in detection and ranging activities to significantly enhance system efficiency and user capacity. The proposed coaxial architecture simplifies hardware requirements using a single avalanche photodiode (APD) for multi-reception, reducing susceptibility to ambient noise and external interferences. We demonstrate 3D imaging at 5 m and 10 m, and the experimental results highlight the capability of our CDMA LiDAR system to achieve 40 parallel ranging channels with centimeter-level depth resolution and an angular resolution of 0.03 degree. Furthermore, our system allows for user identification modulation, enabling identity-based ranging among different users. The robustness of our proposed system against interference and speckle noise and near-far signal problems, combined with its potential for miniaturization and integration into chip-scale optics, presents a promising avenue to develop high-performance, compact LiDAR systems suitable for commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Enhancing Efficiency of DL-based Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks, where the concept of native AI will be introduced. Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) plays a pivotal role in the sixth generation networks to enhance communication rate and localization accuracy. In this letter, we propose a positioning algorithm in a RIS-assisted environment, where the Base Station (BS) is multi-antenna, and the Mobile Station (MS) is single-antenna. We show that our method can achieve a high-precision positioning if the line-of-sight (LOS) is obstructed and three RISs are available. We send several known signals to the receiver in different time slots and change the phase shifters of the RISs simultaneously in a proper way, and we propose a technique to eliminate the destructive effect of the angle-of-departure (AoD) in order to determine the distances between each RISs and the MS. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is better than the algorithms which do not estimate the AoD, shown in the numerical result section.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the application of Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflective Surface (BD-IRS) to enhance THz downlink communication systems, operating in a hybrid: reflective and transmissive mode, to simultaneously provide services to indoor and outdoor users. We propose an optimization framework that jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors and phase shifts in the hybrid reflective/transmissive mode, aiming to maximize the system sum rate. To tackle the challenges in solving the joint design problem, we employ the conjugate gradient method and propose an iterative algorithm that successively optimizes the hybrid beamforming vectors and the phase shifts. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in rate when compared to existing benchmark schemes, including time- and frequency-divided approaches, by approximately $30.5\%$ and $69.9\%$ respectively and even outperforms the STAR-IRS system by $76.99\%$. This underscores the significant influence of IRS elements on system performance relative to that of base station antennas, highlighting their pivotal role in advancing the communication system efficacy.</description>

      <title>Subject-Adaptive Transfer Learning Using Resting State EEG Signals for Cross-Subject EEG Motor Imagery Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) classification is a fundamental, yet challenging task due to the variation of signals between individuals i.e., inter-subject variability. Previous approaches try to mitigate this using task-specific (TS) EEG signals from the target subject in training. However, recording TS EEG signals requires time and limits its applicability in various fields. In contrast, resting state (RS) EEG signals are a viable alternative due to ease of acquisition with rich subject information. In this paper, we propose a novel subject-adaptive transfer learning strategy that utilizes RS EEG signals to adapt models on unseen subject data. Specifically, we disentangle extracted features into task- and subject-dependent features and use them to calibrate RS EEG signals for obtaining task information while preserving subject characteristics. The calibrated signals are then used to adapt the model to the target subject, enabling the model to simulate processing TS EEG signals of the target subject. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in cross-subject EEG MI classification. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging RS EEG signals to advance practical brain-computer interface systems.

      <description>arXiv:2406.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates an uplink pilot-based wireless indoor localization problem in a multipath environment for a single-input single-output (SISO) narrowband communication system aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The indoor localization problem is challenging because the uplink channel consists of multiple overlapping propagation paths with varying amplitudes and phases, which are not easy to differentiate. This letter proposes the use of RIS capable of adaptively changing its reflection pattern to sense such a multiple-path environment. Toward this end, we train a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based controller to perform adaptive sequential reconfigurations of the RIS over multiple stages and propose to group multiple pilots as input in each stage. Information from the multiple paths is captured by training the LSTM to generate multiple RIS configurations to align to the different paths within each stage. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in significantly reducing training complexity while maintaining localization performance at fixed number of pilots.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the probability of error associated with the social machine learning framework, which involves an independent training phase followed by a cooperative decision-making phase over a graph. This framework addresses the problem of classifying a stream of unlabeled data in a distributed manner. In this work, we examine the classification task with limited observations during the decision-making phase, which requires a non-asymptotic performance analysis. We establish a condition for consistent training and derive an upper bound on the probability of error for classification. The results clarify the dependence on the statistical properties of the data and the combination policy used over the graph. They also establish the exponential decay of the probability of error with respect to the number of unlabeled samples.</description>

      <title>Learning Regionalization using Accurate Spatial Cost Gradients within a Differentiable High-Resolution Hydrological Model: Application to the French Mediterranean Region</title>

Abstract: Estimating spatially distributed hydrological parameters in ungauged catchments poses a challenging regionalization problem and requires imposing spatial constraints given the sparsity of discharge data. A possible approach is to search for a transfer function that quantitatively relates physical descriptors to conceptual model parameters. This paper introduces a Hybrid Data Assimilation and Parameter Regionalization (HDA-PR) approach incorporating learnable regionalization mappings, based on either multi-linear regressions or artificial neural networks (ANNs), into a differentiable hydrological model. This approach demonstrates how two differentiable codes can be linked and their gradients chained, enabling the exploitation of heterogeneous datasets across extensive spatio-temporal computational domains within a high-dimensional regionalization context, using accurate adjoint-based gradients. The inverse problem is tackled with a multi-gauge calibration cost function accounting for information from multiple observation sites. HDA-PR was tested on high-resolution, hourly and kilometric regional modeling of 126 flash-flood-prone catchments in the French Mediterranean region. The results highlight a strong regionalization performance of HDA-PR especially in the most challenging upstream-to-downstream extrapolation scenario with ANN, achieving median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores from 0.6 to 0.71 for spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal validations, and improving NSE by up to 30% on average compared to the baseline model calibrated with lumped parameters. ANN enables to learn a non-linear descriptors-to-parameters mapping which provides better model controllability than a linear mapping for complex calibration cases.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Semantic Communication: Architecture, Challenges, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15483</link>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to be a core paradigm in future communication networks, yielding significant benefits in terms of spectrum resource saving and information interaction efficiency. However, the existing SemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and background knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the potential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating and creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this article first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of GAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges. To tackle these challenges, we further propose a novel GAI-integrated SemCom network (GAI-SCN) framework in a cloud-edge-mobile design. Specifically, by employing global and local GAI models, our GAI-SCN enables multimodal semantic content provisioning, semantic-level joint-source-channel coding, and AIGC acquisition to maximize the efficiency and reliability of semantic reasoning and resource utilization. Afterward, we present a detailed implementation workflow of GAI-SCN, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation in comparison with two benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of GAI-SCN.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly perform generation by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then convert it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their usefulness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth extension, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to past work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

      <title>Constant Directivity Loudspeaker Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loudspeaker array beamforming is a common signal processing technique for acoustic directivity control and robust audio reproduction. Unlike their microphone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to arrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency, acoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work proposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient directivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for maximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant directivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their quadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments optimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a full-band heterogeneous array.</description>
