      <title>Chinese-LiPS: A Chinese audio-visual speech recognition dataset with Lip-reading and Presentation Slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating visual modalities to assist Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks has led to significant improvements. However, existing Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) datasets and methods typically rely solely on lip-reading information or speaking contextual video, neglecting the potential of combining these different valuable visual cues within the speaking context. In this paper, we release a multimodal Chinese AVSR dataset, Chinese-LiPS, comprising 100 hours of speech, video, and corresponding manual transcription, with the visual modality encompassing both lip-reading information and the presentation slides used by the speaker. Based on Chinese-LiPS, we develop a simple yet effective pipeline, LiPS-AVSR, which leverages both lip-reading and presentation slide information as visual modalities for AVSR tasks. Experiments show that lip-reading and presentation slide information improve ASR performance by approximately 8\% and 25\%, respectively, with a combined performance improvement of about 35\%.

      <title>Fashion-RAG: Multimodal Fashion Image Editing via Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</description>

      <title>ROI-Guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression Towards Human and Machine Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud data is pivotal in applications like autonomous driving, virtual reality, and robotics. However, its substantial volume poses significant challenges in storage and transmission. In order to obtain a high compression ratio, crucial semantic details usually confront severe damage, leading to difficulties in guaranteeing the accuracy of downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we are the first to introduce a novel Region of Interest (ROI)-guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression (RPCGC) method for human and machine vision. Our framework employs a dual-branch parallel structure, where the base layer encodes and decodes a simplified version of the point cloud, and the enhancement layer refines this by focusing on geometry details. Furthermore, the residual information of the enhancement layer undergoes refinement through an ROI prediction network. This network generates mask information, which is then incorporated into the residuals, serving as a strong supervision signal. Additionally, we intricately apply these mask details in the Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization process, with each point weighted in the distortion calculation. Our loss function includes RD loss and detection loss to better guide point cloud encoding for the machine. Experiment results demonstrate that RPCGC achieves exceptional compression performance and better detection accuracy (10% gain) than some learning-based compression methods at high bitrates in ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.</description>

      <title>Balancing Privacy and Action Performance: A Penalty-Driven Approach to Image Anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of video surveillance systems for object detection, tracking, activity recognition, and anomaly detection has revolutionized our day-to-day lives while setting alarms for privacy concerns. It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.</description>

      <title>Video QoE Metrics from Encrypted Traffic: Application-agnostic Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instant Messaging-Based Video Call Applications (IMVCAs) and Video Conferencing Applications (VCAs) have become integral to modern communication. Ensuring a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users in this context is critical for network operators, as network conditions significantly impact user QoE. However, network operators lack access to end-device QoE metrics due to encrypted traffic. Existing solutions estimate QoE metrics from encrypted traffic traversing the network, with the most advanced approaches leveraging machine learning models. Subsequently, the need for ground truth QoE metrics for training and validation poses a challenge, as not all video applications provide these metrics. To address this challenge, we propose an application-agnostic approach for objective QoE estimation from encrypted traffic. Independent of the video application, we obtained key video QoE metrics, enabling broad applicability to various proprietary IMVCAs and VCAs. To validate our solution, we created a diverse dataset from WhatsApp video sessions under various network conditions, comprising 25,680 seconds of traffic data and QoE metrics. Our evaluation shows high performance across the entire dataset, with 85.2% accuracy for FPS predictions within an error margin of two FPS, and 90.2% accuracy for PIQE-based quality rating classification.</description>

      <title>VLM as Policy: Common-Law Content Moderation Framework for Short Video Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant challenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health, particularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to catastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical limitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high operational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced content understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation regulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update cycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this field. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the existence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law content moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod consists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment &amp; refinement. Leveraging large vision language model (VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video toxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy with rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale online A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the best moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces the user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation increases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several Kuaishou scenarios. We have open-sourced our benchmark at https://kuaimod.github.io.</description>

      <title>SwinGS: Sliding Window Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Video Streaming with Arbitrary Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work and could be easily scaled to volumetric videos with arbitrary length with no increasing of required GPU resources.</description>

      <title>Steganography in Game Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exchange of messages has always carried with it the timeless challenge of secrecy. From whispers in shadows to the enigmatic notes written in the margins of history, humanity has long sought ways to convey thoughts that remain imperceptible to all but the chosen few. The challenge of subliminal communication has been addressed in various forms of steganography. However, the field faces a fundamental paradox: as the art of concealment advances, so too does the science of revelation, leading to an ongoing evolutionary interplay. This study seeks to extend the boundaries of what is considered a viable steganographic medium. We explore a steganographic paradigm, in which hidden information is communicated through the episodes of multiple agents interacting with an environment. Each agent, acting as an encoder, learns a policy to disguise the very existence of hidden messages within actions seemingly directed toward innocent objectives. Meanwhile, an observer, serving as a decoder, learns to associate behavioural patterns with their respective agents despite their dynamic nature, thereby unveiling the hidden messages. The interactions of agents are governed by the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning and shaped by feedback from the observer. This framework encapsulates a game-theoretic dilemma, wherein agents face decisions between cooperating to create distinguishable behavioural patterns or defecting to pursue individually optimal yet potentially overlapping episodic actions. As a proof of concept, we exemplify action steganography through the game of labyrinth, a navigation task where subliminal communication is concealed within the act of steering toward a destination, and systematically validate the stego-system in terms of distortion, capacity, secrecy and robustness when subjected to simulated passive and active adversaries.</description>

      <title>Steganography Beyond Space-Time with Chain of Multimodal AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steganography is the art and science of covert writing, with a broad range of applications interwoven within the realm of cybersecurity. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what, if any, remains invariant. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal artificial intelligence is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both auditory and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual resampling, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research.
