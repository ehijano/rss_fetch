      <title>An ASME-Compliant Helium-4 Evaporation Refrigerator for the SpinQuest Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, safety basis, and commissioning results of a 1 K liquid helium-4 (4He) evaporation refrigerator developed for the Fermilab SpinQuest Experiment (E1039). The system represents the first high power helium evaporation refrigerator operated in a fixed target scattering experiment at Fermilab and was engineered to comply with the Fermilab ES\&amp;H Manual (FESHM) requirements governing pressure vessels, piping, cryogenic systems, and vacuum vessels. The design is mapped to ASME B31.3 (Process Piping) and the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) for pressure boundary integrity and overpressure protection, with documented compliance to FESHM Chapters 5031 (Pressure Vessels), 5031.1 (Piping Systems), and 5033 (Vacuum Vessels). This work documents the methodology used to reach compliance and approval for the 4He evaporation refrigerator at Fermilab which the field lacks. Design considerations specific to the high radiation target-cave environment including remotely located instrumentation approximately 20 m from the cryostat are summarized, together with the relief-system sizing methodology used to accommodate transient heat loads from dynamic nuclear polarization microwaves and the high-intensity proton beam. Commissioning data from July 2024 confirms that the system satisfies all thermal performance and safety objectives.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Micrsocopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (&lt;100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.</description>

      <title>Autonomous X-ray Fluorescence Mapping of Chemically Heterogeneous Systems via a Correlative Feature Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions. Future extensions will incorporate machine learning and probabilistic sampling to further improve detection sensitivity and scan efficiency. X-AutoMap is currently in active use at HXN and provides a flexible foundation for scalable, intelligent imaging workflows at synchrotron beamlines.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Time Resolution in a SiPM-Readout Plastic Scintillator for Cosmic-Ray Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balloon- and space-borne cosmic-ray experiments employ plastic scintillators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to achieve picosecond-level time resolutions for triggering and particle identification. The performance of these systems can be affected by temperature variations encountered in flight. In this work, a time-of-flight (TOF) prototype consisting of a BC418 plastic scintillator bar coupled to Onsemi MICROFC-30050 SiPMs was constructed and tested under a controlled thermal environment between -20 and 20$^{\circ}$C. Electrons from a $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source were used as a beam, and a dedicated differential preamplifier and coincidence triggering were implemented to study the detector response. A minimum time resolution of 160ps was achieved at an overvoltage of 3V, remaining stable across the tested temperature range and uniform along the scintillator bar.</description>

      <title>Time resolution of the ALICE Time-Of-Flight detector with the first Run 3 pp collisions at ${\bf \sqrt{\textit{s}} = 13.6}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle identification (PID) is a fundamental aspect of the ALICE detector system, central to its heavy-ion and proton-proton physics programs. Among the different PID strategies, ALICE uses the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector to identify particles at intermediate momenta ($0.5 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 4$ GeV/$c$). The ALICE TOF detector performed successfully during the first ten years of LHC operations. During the Long Shutdown 2, many ALICE sub-detectors, including TOF, were upgraded to fully leverage the targeted 50 kHz interaction rate of Pb-Pb collisions, which required the implementation of a continuous readout scheme. The TOF detector electronics were upgraded and refurbished, while processing algorithms for data quality control, reconstruction, calibration, and analysis were rewritten. This paper presents the upgraded TOF detector operation and calibration procedures and its performance in terms of timing resolution, a key factor for particle separation in ALICE analyses. Using 2022 pp collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV from Run 3, the time resolution of the detector was estimated with two independent methods, both yielding consistent results, better than 80 ps. Despite the excellent performance already achieved, further improvements are expected after additional detector commissioning and refined calibration procedures, thus enhancing the ALICE PID capabilities for Run 3 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Development of the CEPC analog hadron calorimeter prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a next-generation electron$-$positron collider proposed for the precise measurement of the properties of the Higgs boson. To emphasize boson separation and jet reconstruction, the baseline design of the CEPC detector was guided by the particle flow algorithm (PFA) concept. As one of the calorimeter options, the analogue hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) was proposed. The CEPC AHCAL comprises a 40-layer sandwich structure using steel plates as absorbers and scintillator tiles coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) as sensitive units. To validate the feasibility of the AHCAL option, a series of studies were conducted to develop a prototype. This AHCAL prototype underwent an electronic test and a cosmic ray test to assess its performance and ensure it was ready for three beam tests performed in 2022 and 2023. The test beam data is currently under analysis, and the results are expected to deepen our understanding of hadron showers, validate the concept of Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA), and ultimately refine the design of the CEPC detector.</description>

      <title>Edge Machine Learning for Cluster Counting in Next-Generation Drift Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&amp;D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Topmetal-L: A Low Noise Charge-Sensitive Pixel Sensor for POLAR2/LPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2-10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $\mu$m^2 charge-collecting electrode window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0-4 ke-, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\mu$V/e-, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e-, a sensitive area exceeding 3.6 cm^2, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel-scanning readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.0 keV source, and a counting rate saturated at 15 k counts/(cm^2$\cdot$s) when tested at 5.4 keV.</description>

      <title>M3Scope a 3D multimode multiplane microscope for imaging nanoscale dynamics in soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.</description>

      <title>CaloChallenge 2022: A Community Challenge for Fast Calorimeter Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of the "Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022" - the CaloChallenge. We study state-of-the-art generative models on four calorimeter shower datasets of increasing dimensionality, ranging from a few hundred voxels to a few tens of thousand voxels. The 31 individual submissions span a wide range of current popular generative architectures, including Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, Diffusion models, and models based on Conditional Flow Matching. We compare all submissions in terms of quality of generated calorimeter showers, as well as shower generation time and model size. To assess the quality we use a broad range of different metrics including differences in 1-dimensional histograms of observables, KPD/FPD scores, AUCs of binary classifiers, and the log-posterior of a multiclass classifier. The results of the CaloChallenge provide the most complete and comprehensive survey of cutting-edge approaches to calorimeter fast simulation to date. In addition, our work provides a uniquely detailed perspective on the important problem of how to evaluate generative models. As such, the results presented here should be applicable for other domains that use generative AI and require fast and faithful generation of samples in a large phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Development and performance evaluation of a water-based liquid scintillator tracking detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a novel tracking detector utilizing a water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) for the accurate characterization of neutrino interactions on a water target. In this detector, the WbLS is optically segmented into small cells by reflective separators, and the scintillation light is read out in three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In this paper, we report on a design of the WbLS tracking detector, the development of the WbLS, the results of the beam test, and subsequent improvements to the WbLS and optical separators.</description>

Abstract: As liquid xenon time projection chambers scale to ever-larger sizes, so too do the engineering challenges they pose. We describe a large, flexible, multipurpose test facility capable of supporting the development of a number of key aspects of liquid xenon detector systems. Example applications of this facility include characterization of large-area light and charge sensor arrays, tests of xenon purification techniques and materials compatibility, and investigations into high-voltage phenomena. This facility uses an automated and remotely monitored cryo-cooling system based on immersion of the test chamber in a liquid bath rather than conductive coupling, leading to advantages in temperature and pressure stability, as well as increasing required response times in the case of cooling-power loss. Design advantages, operational procedures, and performance of the facility are described, as well as five examples of liquid xenon test chambers that use the facility.</description>

      <title>Signal Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms for Precise Timing with PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High particle rates in current and future experiments make pile-up phenomena a critical issue for extracting useful information. In this context, timing can be important as the 4$^{\mathrm{th}}$ dimension parameter for triggering or event reconstruction. The PICOSEC-Micromegas detector has been shown to offer precise timing of the order of tens of\,ps. In this work, novel signal processing algorithms are being developed and evaluated to demonstrate the technology's ability for online precise timing. We propose, an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This algorithm uses a model to train the ANN. The performance of the different algorithms is evaluated using experimental data, resulting in a timing resolution of 18.3 $\pm$ 0.6\,ps, comparable to the standard analysis based on the Constant Fraction Discrimination technique. Additionally, an alternative algorithm using the charge of the pulse exceeding a threshold as a parameter to correct for systematic effects is reported.</description>

      <title>Performance of heavy-flavour jet identification in Lorentz-boosted topologies in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

Abstract: Measurements in the highly Lorentz-boosted regime provoke increased interest in probing the Higgs boson properties and in searching for particles beyond the standard model at the LHC. In the CMS Collaboration, various boosted-object tagging algorithms, designed to identify hadronic jets originating from a massive particle decaying to $\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ or $\mathrm{c\overline{c}}$, have been developed and deployed across a range of physics analyses. This paper highlights their performance on simulated events, and summarizes novel calibration techniques using proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV during the 2016$-$2018 LHC data-taking period. Three dedicated methods are used for the calibration in multijet events, leveraging either machine learning techniques, the presence of muons within energetic boosted jets, or the reconstruction of hadronically decaying high-energy Z bosons. The calibration results, obtained through a combination of these approaches, are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>An ultrafast plenoptic-camera system for high-resolution 3D particle tracking in unsegmented scintillators</title>

Abstract: Detectors deployed in high-resolution neutrino experiments, particle calorimetry, or dark matter candidate searches require dense and massive active materials and, in some cases, extremely fine segmentation. This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample batch.TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>
