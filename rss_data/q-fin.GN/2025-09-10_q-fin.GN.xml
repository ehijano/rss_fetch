      <title>Automated Trading System for Straddle-Option Based on Deep Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Straddle Option is a financial trading tool that explores volatility premiums in high-volatility markets without predicting price direction. Although deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to trading automation in financial markets, existing work mostly focused on predicting price trends and making trading decisions by combining multi-dimensional datasets like blogs and videos, which led to high computational costs and unstable performance in high-volatility markets. To tackle this challenge, we develop automated straddle option trading based on reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms to handle unpredictability in high-volatility markets. Firstly, we leverage the attention mechanisms in Transformer-DDQN through both self-attention with time series data and channel attention with multi-cycle information. Secondly, a novel reward function considering excess earnings is designed to focus on long-term profits and neglect short-term losses over a stop line. Thirdly, we identify the resistance levels to provide reference information when great uncertainty in price movements occurs with intensified battle between the buyers and sellers. Through extensive experiments on the Chinese stock, Brent crude oil, and Bitcoin markets, our attention-based Transformer-DDQN model exhibits the lowest maximum drawdown across all markets, and outperforms other models by 92.5\% in terms of the average return excluding the crude oil market due to relatively low fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Joint calibration of the volatility surface and variance term structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a calibration framework for complex option pricing models that jointly fits market option prices and the term structure of variance. Calibrated models under the conventional objective function, the sum of squared errors in Black-Scholes implied volatilities, can produce model-implied variance term structures with large errors relative to those observed in the market and implied by option prices. I show that this can occur even when the model-implied volatility surface closely matches the volatility surface observed in the market. The proposed joint calibration addresses this issue by augmenting the conventional objective function with a penalty term for large deviations from the observed variance term structure. This augmented objective function features a hyperparameter that governs the relative weight placed on the volatility surface and the variance term structure. I test this framework on a jump-diffusion model with stochastic volatility in two calibration exercises: the first using volatility surfaces generated under a Bates model, and the second using a panel of S&amp;P 500 equity index options covering the 1996-2023 period. I demonstrate that the proposed method is able to fit observed option prices well while delivering realistic term structures of variance. Finally, I provide guidance on the choice of hyperparameters based on the results of these numerical exercises.</description>

      <title>Environmental Performance, Financial Constraint and Tax Avoidance Practices: Insights from FTSE All-Share Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through its initiative known as the Climate Change Act (2008), the Government of the United Kingdom encourages corporations to enhance their environmental performance with the significant aim of reducing targeted greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Previous research has predominantly assessed this encouragement favourably, suggesting that improved environmental performance bolsters governmental efforts to protect the environment and fosters commendable corporate governance practices among companies. Studies indicate that organisations exhibiting strong corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, or high levels of environmental performance often engage in lower occurrences of tax avoidance. However, our findings suggest that an increase in environmental performance may paradoxically lead to a rise in tax avoidance activities. Using a sample of 567 firms listed on the FTSE All Share from 2014 to 2022, our study finds that firms associated with higher environmental performance are more likely to avoid taxation. The study further documents that the effect is more pronounced for firms facing financial constraints. Entropy balancing, propensity score matching analysis, the instrumental variable method, and the Heckman test are employed in our study to address potential endogeneity concerns. Collectively, the findings of our study suggest that better environmental performance helps explain the variation in firms tax avoidance practices.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for General Insurance Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g. sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework. Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.</description>
