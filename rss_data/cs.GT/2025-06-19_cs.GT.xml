      <title>A theory of Lending Protocols in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lending protocols are one of the main applications of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), enabling crypto-assets loan markets with a total value estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Unlike traditional lending systems, these protocols operate without relying on trusted authorities or off-chain enforcement mechanisms. To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the loan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as rewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by awarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol. In this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the essential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove key properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tractable Graph Structures in EFX Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its introduction, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) has become a fundamental solution concept in fair division of indivisible goods. Its existence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility functions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists. Unsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable cases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the notion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and the items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are incident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents while satisfying the EFX condition.
  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp complexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph -- polynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs with chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic landscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.
  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent condition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the valuations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals away from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value makes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away from being bipartite. We further perform a parameterized analysis to examine structures of the underlying graph that enable tractability. In particular, we show that the problem is solvable in linear time on graphs whose treewidth is bounded by a constant and that the complexity of an instance is closely tied to the sizes of acyclic connected components on its one-valued edges.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Q-learners Can Provably Collude in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of computational studies shows that simple machine learning agents converge to cooperative behaviors in social dilemmas, such as collusive price-setting in oligopoly markets, raising questions about what drives this outcome. In this work, we provide theoretical foundations for this phenomenon in the context of self-play multi-agent Q-learners in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. We characterize broad conditions under which such agents provably learn the cooperative Pavlov (win-stay, lose-shift) policy rather than the Pareto-dominated "always defect" policy. We validate our theoretical results through additional experiments, demonstrating their robustness across a broader class of deep learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Less-excludable Mechanism for DAOs in Public Good Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have emerged in public good auctions, allowing "small" bidders to gather together and enlarge their influence in high-valued auctions. However, models and mechanisms in the existing research literature do not guarantee non-excludability, which is a main property of public goods. As such, some members of the winning DAO may be explicitly prevented from accessing the public good. This side effect leads to regrouping of small bidders within the DAO to have a larger say in the final outcome. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the best regrouping of bidders that maximizes the total bidding power of a DAO. We also prove that such a regrouping is less-excludable, better aligning the needs of the entire DAO and the nature of public goods. Next, notice that members of a DAO in public good auctions often have a positive externality among themselves. Thus we introduce a collective factor into the members' utility functions. We further extend the mechanism's allocation for each member to allow for partial access to the public good. Under the new model, we propose a mechanism that is incentive compatible in generic games and achieves higher social welfare as well as less-excludable allocations.</description>

      <title>Computing the Schulze Method for Large-Scale Preference Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schulze method is a voting rule widely used in practice and enjoys many positive axiomatic properties. While it is computable in polynomial time, its straight-forward implementation does not scale well for large elections. In this paper, we develop a highly optimised algorithm for computing the Schulze method with Pregel, a framework for massively parallel computation of graph problems, and demonstrate its applicability for large preference data sets. In addition, our theoretic analysis shows that the Schulze method is indeed particularly well-suited for parallel computation, in stark contrast to the related ranked pairs method. More precisely we show that winner determination subject to the Schulze method is NL-complete, whereas this problem is P-complete for the ranked pairs method.</description>

      <title>CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.</description>
