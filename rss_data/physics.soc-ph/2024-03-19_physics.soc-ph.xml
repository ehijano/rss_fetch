      <title>Cooperation in a non-Ergodic World on a Network -- Insurance and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation between individuals is emergent in all parts of society, yet mechanistic reasons for this emergence is ill understood in the literature. A specific example of this is insurance. Recent work has, though, shown that assuming the risk individuals face is proportional to their wealth and optimising the time average growth rate rather than the ensemble average results in a non-zero-sum game, where both parties benefit from cooperation through insurance contracts. In a recent paper, Peters and Skjold present a simple agent-based model and show how, over time, agents that enter into such cooperatives outperform agents that do not. Here, we extend this work by restricting the possible connections between agents via a lattice network. Under these restrictions, we still find that all agents profit from cooperating through insurance. We, though, further find that clusters of poor and rich agents emerge endogenously on the two-dimensional map and that wealth inequalities persist for a long duration, consistent with the phenomenon known as the poverty trap. By tuning the parameters which control the risk levels, we simulate both highly advantageous and extremely risky gambles and show that despite the qualitative shift in the type of risk, the findings are consistent.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the international staple agrifood trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is a growing concern worldwide and poses serious threats to regional and global food security. Using monthly trade data for maize, rice, and wheat from 2016/1 to 2022/12, this paper constructs three international crop trade networks (iCTNs) and an aggregate international food trade network (iFTN). We aim to examine the structural changes following the occurrence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We find significant shifts in the number of edges, average degree, density, efficiency, and natural connectivity in the third quarter of 2022, particularly in the international wheat trade network. Additionally, we have shown that political reasons have caused more pronounced changes in the trade connections between the economies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia than with Ukraine. This paper could provide insights into the negative impact of geopolitical conflicts on the global food system and encourage a series of effective strategies to mitigate the negative impact of the conflict on global food trade.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of networks with weak geometric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Renormalization Group is crucial for understanding systems across scales, including complex networks. Renormalizing networks via network geometry, a framework in which their topology is based on the location of nodes in a hidden metric space, is one of the foundational approaches. However, the current methods assume that the geometric coupling is strong, neglecting weak coupling in many real networks. This paper extends renormalization to weak geometric coupling, showing that geometric information is essential to preserve self-similarity. Our results underline the importance of geometric effects on network topology even when the coupling to the underlying space is weak.</description>

      <title>Gun Culture in Fringe Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09254v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of mass shootings in the United States has, unfortunately, become a norm. While the issue of gun control in the US involves complex legal concerns, there are also societal issues at play. One such social issue is so-called "gun culture," i.e., a general set of beliefs and actions related to gun ownership. However relatively little is known about gun culture, and even less is known when it comes to fringe online communities. This is especially worrying considering the aforementioned rise in mass shootings and numerous instances of shooters being radicalized online.
  To address this gap, we explore gun culture on /k/, 4chan's weapons board. More specifically, using a variety of quantitative techniques, we examine over 4M posts on /k/ and position their discussion within the larger body of theoretical understanding of gun culture. Among other things, our findings suggest that gun culture on /k/ covers a relatively diverse set of topics (with a particular focus on legal discussion), some of which are signals of fetishism.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SIS process on a graph poses many challenges. An important problem is to identify characteristics of the metastable behaviour. Existing mean-field methods (such as Heterogeneous Mean Field and the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation) overestimate the metastable infected fraction, because they ignore correlations. Especially in sparse graphs, this leads to serious inaccuracies. We propose quenched and annealed methods incorporating correlations and giving significantly more accurate approximations. We use the Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph as a test case, but the methods can be generalized easily. Our methods are computationally very friendly and can be applied to fairly large graphs, in contrast with some other second-order mean field approximations.</description>

      <title>Mobility Census for monitoring rapid urban development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring urban structure and development requires high-quality data at high spatiotemporal resolution. While traditional censuses have provided foundational insights into demographic and socioeconomic aspects of urban life, their pace may not always align with the pace of urban development. To complement these traditional methods, we explore the potential of analyzing alternative big-data sources, such as human mobility data. However, these often noisy and unstructured big data pose new challenges. Here we propose a method to extract meaningful explanatory variables and classifications from such data. Using movement data from Beijing, which are produced as a byproduct of mobile communication, we show that meaningful features can be extracted, revealing, for example, the emergence and absorption of subcentres. This method allows the analysis of urban dynamics at a high spatial resolution (here, 500m) and near real-time frequency, and high computational efficiency, which is especially suitable for tracing event-driven mobility changes and their impact on urban structures.</description>

      <title>Individual differences in knowledge network navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid accumulation of online information, efficient web navigation has grown vital yet challenging. To create an easily navigable cyberspace catering to diverse demographics, understanding how people navigate differently is paramount. While previous research has unveiled individual differences in spatial navigation, such differences in knowledge space navigation remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed personal information questionnaires. Our analysis shows that age negatively affects knowledge space navigation performance, while multilingualism enhances it. Under time pressure, participants' performance improves across trials and males outperform females, an effect not observed in games without time pressure. In our experiment, successful route-finding is usually not related to abilities of innovative exploration of routes. Our results underline the importance of age, multilingualism and time constraint in the knowledge space navigation.</description>

      <title>Short research review: Applications of statistical physics investigating financial and other social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics research complements traditional approaches, such as mathematical (stochastic) finance and econometrics in quantitative economics and finance. In the early years of this millennium, we embarked on an interdisciplinary research endeavor in Lithuania, applying concepts from statistical physics to understand complex financial and social systems. Here, we provide a short review of investigations in Lithuania, spanning from 2008 to 2022, undertaken by our research group.</description>

      <title>The optimal placement of the head in the noun phrase. The case of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The word order of a sentence is shaped by multiple principles. The principle of syntactic dependency distance minimization is in conflict with the principle of surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) in single head syntactic dependency structures: while the former predicts that the head should be placed at the center of the linear arrangement, the latter predicts that the head should be placed at one of the ends (either first or last). A critical question is when surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) should surpass syntactic dependency distance minimization. In the context of single head structures, it has been predicted that this is more likely to happen when two conditions are met, i.e. (a) fewer words are involved and (b) words are shorter. Here we test the prediction on the noun phrase when it is composed of a demonstrative, a numeral, an adjective and a noun. We find that, across preferred orders in languages, the noun tends to be placed at one of the ends, confirming the theoretical prediction. We also show evidence of anti locality effects: syntactic dependency distances in preferred orders are longer than expected by chance.</description>
