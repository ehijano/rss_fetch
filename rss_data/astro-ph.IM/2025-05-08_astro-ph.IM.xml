      <title>Machine Learning Workflow for Morphological Classification of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the EU-funded Center of Excellence SPACE (Scalable Parallel Astrophysical Codes for Exascale), seven commonly used astrophysics simulation codes are being optimized to exploit exascale computing platforms. Exascale cosmological simulations will produce large amounts of data (i.e. several petabytes) that will soon be waiting to be analyzed, with enormous potential for scientific breakthroughs. Our tool Spherinator enables the reduction of these complex data sets to a low-dimensional space using Generative Deep Learning to understand the morphological structure of simulated galaxies. A spherical latent space allows the HiPSter module to provide explorative visualization using Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS) in the Aladin software.
  Here we present a machine-learning workflow covering all stages, from data collection to preprocessing, training, prediction, and final deployment. This workflow ensures full reproducibility by keeping track of the code, data, and environment. Additionally, the workflow allows for scalability in managing a large amount of data and complex pipelines. We use only open source software and standards that align with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reproducibility) principles. In this way, we are able to distribute the workflow reliably and enable collaboration by sharing code, data, and results efficiently.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Learning Method for Radio Interferometry Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the incomplete sampling of spatial frequencies by radio interferometers, achieving precise restoration of astrophysical information remains challenging. To address this ill-posed problem, compressive sensing(CS) provides a robust framework for stable and unique recovery of sky brightness distributions in noisy environments, contingent upon satisfying specific conditions. We explore the applicability of CS theory and find that for radio interferometric telescopes, the conditions can be simplified to sparse representation. {{Building on this insight, we develop a deep dictionary (realized through a convolutional neural network), which is designed to be multi-resolution and overcomplete, to achieve sparse representation and integrate it within the CS framework. The resulting method is a novel, fully interpretable unsupervised learning approach that combines}} the mathematical rigor of CS with the expressive power of deep neural networks, effectively bridging the gap between deep learning and classical dictionary methods. {{During the deconvolution process, the model image and the deep dictionary are updated alternatively.}} This approach enables efficient and accurate recovery of extended sources with complex morphologies from noisy measurements. Comparative analyses with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, i.e., achieving a dynamic range (DR) nearly 45 to 100 times higher than that of multiscale CLEAN (MS-CLEAN).</description>

      <title>Gaussian process representation of dispersion measure noise in pulsar wideband datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium disperses pulsar radio signals, resulting in a stochastic time-variable delay known as the dispersion measure (DM) noise. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, we measure a DM together with a time of arrival from a pulsar observation to handle frequency-dependent profile evolution, interstellar scintillation, and radio frequency interference more robustly, and to reduce data volumes. In this paper, we derive a method to incorporate arbitrary models of DM variation, including Gaussian process models, in pulsar timing and noise analysis and pulsar timing array analysis. This generalizes the existing method for handling DM noise in wideband datasets.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of GNSS-inferred precipitable water vapour at the potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe currently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230 GHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently, that of Sgr A$^\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to dynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to extend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and the H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). Precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity and noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to sub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and the atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show both sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz possible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of 14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm at the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites, the Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the most suitable site for the AMT.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the accuracy of GNSS inferred precipitable water vapour against that from a 210 GHz WVR at the H.E.S.S. site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) site and the Gamsberg Mountain have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre wavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore needs to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to investigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at the two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements by the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS station PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR) also installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34 mm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site pressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature ($\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison, the offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure were used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS station with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to reliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for star formation parameterization using symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation (SF) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is fundamental to understanding galaxy evolution and planet formation. However, efforts to develop closed-form analytic expressions that link SF with key influencing physical variables, such as gas density and turbulence, remain challenging. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and use symbolic regression (SR) techniques to produce the first data-driven, ML-discovered analytic expressions for SF using the publicly available FIRE-2 simulation suites. Employing a pipeline based on training the genetic algorithm of SR from an open software package called PySR, in tandem with a custom loss function and a model selection technique which compares candidate equations to analytic approaches to describing SF, we produce symbolic representations of a predictive model for the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) averaged over both 10 Myr and 100 Myr based on eight extracted variables from FIRE-2 galaxies. The resulting model that PySR finds best describes SF, on both averaging timescales, features equations that incorporates the surface density of gas, $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$, the velocity dispersion of gas $\sigma_{\mathrm{gas,~z}}$ and the surface density of stars $\Sigma_\mathrm{*}$. Furthermore, we find that the equations found for the longer SFR timescale all converge to a scaling-relation-like equation, all of which also closely capture the intrinsic physical scatter of the data within the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane. This observed convergence to physically interpretable scaling relations at longer SFR timescales demonstrates that our method successfully identifies robust physical relationships rather than fitting to stochastic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled optical large-baseline interferometry: applications, protocols and feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the polarimetric response of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope and its impact on precision pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \citet{Guillemot2023} we presented a new method for calibrating pulsar observations conducted with the Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT), which significantly improved NRT polarimetric measurements and pulsar timing quality for data taken after this method was developed, in November 2019. Results hinted at a dependence of the polarimetric response of the NRT on the observed direction. We investigated this potential dependence, since unaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric measurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly calibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We conducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination ranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\sim$ 180$^\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full polarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of calibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used the METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From the analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn rotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to vary with hour angle or declination. On the other hand, the new METM-based calibration method appears to significantly improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. By analyzing NRT data on a selection of millisecond pulsars we found that the new polarimetric profiles are more homogeneous, they generally have larger signal-to-noise ratios, and found that the TOA data for these MSPs are more accurate and contain lower levels of noise, especially when combining the new calibration method with the \textit{Matrix Template Matching} (MTM) method for extracting TOAs from pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of 20 Million Giant Stars Based on Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to estimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra for giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input spectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the precision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample, our model can estimate metallicities down to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -4$. We compare our estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star clusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates for VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we obtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million giant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12149/101604. This work highlights the potential of low-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable dataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise artefacts with optimised conformal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in the Measurement of Neutron lifetime Using Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of free neutrons measured in the lab has a long standing disparity of $\sim$9~s. A space-based technique has recently been proposed to independently measure the neutron lifetime using interactions between the galactic cosmic rays and a low atmosphere planetary body. This technique has not produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data that contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer on-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and study two large systematics in the measurement of neutron lifetime: the lunar sub-surface temperature and the lunar surface composition. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data when the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion period. We report the neutron lifetime using four different models that each have different choices of surface temperature and composition. 5$^{\circ}$ \cite{prettyman2006elemental} and 2$^{\circ}$ re-binned \cite{wilson2021measurement} maps result in 777.6$\pm$11.7~s and 739.6$\pm$10.8~s respectively. For the 20$^{\circ}$ map, constant equatorial and a latitude-dependent temperature model result in 738.6$\pm$10.8~s and 767.3$\pm$11.2~s respectively. Increasing the complexities of the models accounting for the systematic effects increase the measured lifetime. However, the reported measurements are not competitive with the laboratory results due to large unaccounted systematics resulting from non-optimized measurements and modeling assumptions. This work serves as a study of systematic uncertainties for future neutron lifetime measurements using the space-based technique. We estimate the effect on the lifetime from the choice of temperature model to be to be 28.7 $\pm$ 15.5~s, and choice of compositional map (for 20$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$ maps) to be 10.3 $\pm$ 12.2~s.</description>

      <title>Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <title>FLARE: A Framework for Stellar Flare Forecasting using Stellar Physical Properties and Historical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</description>

      <title>The Spectroscopic Stage-5 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence, properties, and dynamics of the dark sectors of our universe pose fundamental challenges to our current model of physics, and large-scale astronomical surveys may be our only hope to unravel these long-standing mysteries. In this white paper, we describe the science motivation, instrumentation, and survey plan for the next-generation spectroscopic observatory, the Stage-5 Spectroscopic Experiment (Spec-S5). Spec-S5 is a new all-sky spectroscopic instrument optimized to efficiently carry out cosmological surveys of unprecedented scale and precision. The baseline plan for Spec-S5 involves upgrading two existing 4-m telescopes to new 6-m wide-field facilities, each with a highly multiplexed spectroscopic instrument capable of simultaneously measuring the spectra of 13,000 astronomical targets. Spec-S5, which builds and improves on the hardware used for previous cosmology experiments, represents a cost-effective and rapid approach to realizing a more than 10$\times$ gain in spectroscopic capability compared to the current state-of-the-art represented by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument project (DESI). Spec-S5 will provide a critical scientific capability in the post-Rubin and post-DESI era for advancing cosmology, fundamental physics, and astrophysics in the 2030s.</description>
