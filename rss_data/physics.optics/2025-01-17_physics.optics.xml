      <title>Relationship between total reflection and Fabry-Perot bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have interesting properties and important applications in photonics. A particular class of BICs are found in Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities formed by two parallel periodic dielectric layers separated by a distance $h$. A periodic dielectric layer can totally reflect a plane incident wave with a particular frequency and a particular wavenumber. Existing FP-BICs are found when $h$ is close to the values deduced from a phase-matching condition related to the reflection coefficient, but they are obtained in FP-cavities where the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction. In this paper, we further clarify the connection between total reflections and FP-BICs. Our numerical results indicate that if the wavenumber is zero or the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction, FP-BICs can indeed be found near the parameters of total reflections. However, if the wavenumber is nonzero and the periodic layer is asymmetric (in the periodic direction), we are unable to find a FP-BIC (with a frequency and a wavenumber near those of a total reflection) by tuning $h$ or other structural parameters. Consequently, a total reflection does not always lead to a FP-BIC even when the parameters of the FP-cavity are tuned.</description>

      <title>UV filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter starts with a discussion of the main qualitative differences between UV and mid-IR filaments: from multiphoton ionization in the UV to tunnel ionization in the near- to mid-IR. A general qualitative analysis of the properties of single filaments versus wavelength follows. Because of their long pulse duration, a quasi-steady-state theory of their propagation is possible. An eigenvalue approach leads to a steady-state field envelope that is compared to the Townes soliton. However, that solution is close enough to a Gaussian shape to justify a parametric evolution approach. After this theoretical introduction, an experimental verification at 266 nm follows. Femtosecond UV filaments were generated with frequency-tripled Ti:sapphire sources and KrF amplifiers. The source for long-pulse filaments is an oscillator-amplifier Nd-YAG Q-switched system, frequency doubled, compressed, and frequency doubled again to reach 170 ps pulses of 300 mJ energy. The sub-nanosecond duration of the UV pulse may revive the debate as whether the filament is a moving focus or self-induced waveguide. Two applications of UV filaments are presented in the last two sections. It is shown that isotopically selective laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is possible by exploiting the narrow dips observed in the emission spectrum. These dips are due to reabsorption by the material in the plume created by the impact of the filament on a solid. These absorption lines are only a few-pm wide and are exactly centered at the wavelength of a transition from ground state of the material, without any Stark shift or broadening. A final application is laser-induced discharge, which is a guided discharge that follows exactly the path of the inducing UV filament. Laser-induced discharge may lead to the control of lightning, which is a topic of intense research in Europe.</description>

      <title>High-speed readout for direct light orbital angular momentum photodetector via photoelastic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in direct photodetection of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) based on the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE) provides an effective way for on-chip direct electric readout of orbital angular momentum, as well as large-scale integration focal-plane array devices. However, the recognition of OAM order from photocurrent response requires the extraction of circular polarization-dependent response. To date, the operation speed of such detector is currently at the minute level and is limited by slow mechanical polarization modulation and low OAM recognition capability. In this work, we demonstrate that the operation speed can be greatly improved via electrical polarization modulation strategy with photoelasitc modulator accompanied by phase-locked readout approach with lock-in amplifier. We demonstrate an operation speed of up to 1 kHz with this new technology in the mid-infrared region (4 {\mu}m) on an OAM detector using multilayer graphene (MLG) as photosensitive material. In principle, with new modulation and readout scheme, we can potentially increase the operation speed to 50.14 kHz with a PEM that operates at a state-of-the-art speed. Our work paves the way toward high-speed operation of direct OAM detection devices based on OPGE effect and pushes such technology to a more practical stage for focal plane array applications.</description>

      <title>Laser optothermal nanobomb for efficient flattening of nanobubbles in van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanobubbles are typical nanodefects commonly existing in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials such as transition metal dioxides, especially after their transfer from growth substrate to target substrates. These nanobubbles, though tiny, may significantly alter the local electric, optoelectronic, thermal, or mechanical properties of 2D materials and therefore are rather detrimental to the constructed devices. However, there is no post-processing method so far that can effectively eliminate nanobubbles in 2D materials after their fabrication and transfer, which has been a major obstacle in the development of 2D material based devices. Here, we propose a principle, called laser optothermal nanobomb (LOTB), that can effectively flatten nanobubbles in 2D materials through a dynamic process of optothermally induced phase transition and stress-pulling effect in nanobubbles. Operation of LOTB on monolayer molybdenum disulfide (1L-MoS2) films shows that the surface roughness can be reduced by more than 70% on a time scale of ~50 ms, without damage to the intrinsic property of 1L-MoS2 as validated by micro-nano photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, a dual-beam cascaded LOTB and a multi-shot LOTB strategies are proposed to increase the flattened area and processing effect, showing the potential of LOTB for fast nanodefect repairing in the mass production of van der Waals materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Automatic exposure volumetric additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) achieves high print speed and design freedom by continuous volumetric light patterning. This differs from traditional vat photopolymerization techniques that use brief sequential (2D) plane- or (1D) point-localized exposures. The drawback to volumetric light patterning is the small exposure window. Overexposure quickly leads to cured out-of-part voxels due to the nonzero background dose arising from light projection through the build volume. For tomographic VAM, correct exposure time is critical to achieving high repeatability, however, we find that correct exposure time varies by nearly 40% depending on resin history. Currently, tomographic VAM exposure is timed based on subjective human determination of print completion, which is tedious and yields poor repeatability. Here, we implement a robust auto exposure routine for tomographic VAM using real-time processing of light scattering data, yielding accurate and repeatable prints without human intervention. The resulting print fidelity and repeatability approaches, and in some cases, exceeds that of commercial resin 3D printers. We show that auto exposure VAM generalizes well to a wide variety of print geometries with small positive and negative features. The repeatability and accuracy of auto exposure VAM allows for building multi-part objects, fulfilling a major requirement of additive manufacturing technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modulation of dual-band nonreciprocal radiation in a graphene-Weyl semimetal plasmonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a hybrid structure combining graphene and Weyl semimetal, capable of achieving dynamically adjustable dual-band nonreciprocal radiation. The results reveal that the nonreciprocal radiation can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between resonance mode excitation and the unique properties of Weyl materials, with the electric field distribution providing further insights into the graphene plasmon modes involved. By exploiting the resonant characteristics of graphene plasmons, we demonstrate that strong nonreciprocal radiation can be effectively regulated through adjusting the grating's geometric parameters, while maintaining robustness over a wide range. Notably, substantial dynamic tuning of the resonant wavelength for nonreciprocal radiation is achievable by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. Our research results offer promising prospects for the developing of complex energy harvesting and conversion systems within advanced thermal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Multiple truly topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons at terahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional propagation based on surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) has recently been realized at the interface of magnetized semiconductors. However, usually SMPs lose their unidirectionality due to non-local effects, especially in the lower trivial bandgap of such structures. More recently, a truly unidirectional SMP (USMP) has been demonstrated in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap, but it supports only a single USMP, limiting its functionality. In this work, we present a fundamental physical model for multiple, robust, truly topological USMP modes at terahertz (THz) frequencies, realized in a semiconductor-dielectric-semiconductor (SDS) slab waveguide under opposing external magnetic fields. We analytically derive the dispersion properties of the SMPs and perform numerical analysis in both local and non-local models. Our results show that the SDS waveguide supports two truly (even and odd) USMP modes in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap. Exploiting these two modes, we demonstrate unidirectional SMP multimode interference (USMMI), being highly robust and immune to backscattering, overcoming the back-reflection issue in conventional bidirectional waveguides. To demonstrate the usefullness of this approach, we numerically realize a frequency- and magnetically-tunable arbitrary-ratio splitter based on this robust USMMI, enabling multimode conversion. We, further, identify a unique index-near-zero (INZ) odd USMP mode in the SDS waveguide, distinct from conventional semiconductor-dielectric-metal waveguides. Leveraging this INZ mode, we achieve phase modulation with a phase shift from -$\pi$ to $\pi$. Our work expands the manipulation of topological waves and enriches the field of truly non-reciprocal topological physics for practical device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of optical speckle tweezers (ST) to manipulate the motility of Escherichia coli bacteria. By employing the generated speckle patterns, we demonstrate the ability to control bacterial dynamics through optical forces. Our findings reveal that ST effectively modulates run-and-tumble behavior and alters motility patterns, providing insights into active matter systems. The results establish optical ST as a versatile and non-invasive tool for investigating and controlling the behavior of active particles, offering potential applications in active matter research.</description>

      <title>Self-interfering high harmonic beam arrays driven by Hermite-Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of structured light to drive highly nonlinear processes in matter not only enables imprinting spatially-resolved properties onto short-wavelength radiation, but also opens alternative avenues for exploring the dynamics of nonlinear laser-matter interactions. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically explore the unique properties of driving high-order harmonic generation (HHG) with Hermite-Gaussian beams. HHG driven by Laguerre-Gauss modes results in harmonics that inherit the azimuthal Laguerre-Gauss modal structure, with their topological charge scaling according to orbital angular momentum conservation. In contrast, when HHG is driven by Hermite-Gauss beams, the harmonic modes do not show a direct correspondence to the driving modal profile. Our experimental measurements using HG$_{01}$ and HG$_{11}$ modes, which are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations, show that the lobes of the Hermite-Gauss driving beams effectively produce a set of separate phase-locked harmonic beamlets which can interfere downstream. This self-interference, which can be adjusted through the relative position between the gas target and the driving beam focus, can be exploited for precision extreme-ultraviolet interferometry. We demonstrate a simple application to calibrate the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet diffraction grating. In addition, we show through simulations that the array of harmonic beamlets can be used as an illumination source for single-shot extreme-ultraviolet ptychography.</description>

      <title>Resolution enhancement in quantitative phase microscopy: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), a technique combining phase imaging and microscopy, enables visualization of the 3D topography in reflective samples, as well as the inner structure or refractive index distribution of transparent and translucent samples. Similar to other imaging modalities, QPM is constrained by the conflict between numerical aperture (NA) and field of view (FOV): an imaging system with a low NA has to be employed to maintain a large FOV. This fact severely limits the resolution in QPM up to being the illumination wavelength. Consequently, finer structures of samples cannot be resolved by using modest NA objectives in QPM. Aimed to that, many approaches, such as oblique illumination, structured illumination, and speckle illumination (just to cite a few), have been proposed to improve the spatial resolution (or the space bandwidth product) in phase microscopy by restricting other degrees of freedom (mostly time). This paper aims to provide an up to date review on the resolution enhancement approaches in QPM, discussing the pros and cons of each technique as well as the confusion on resolution definition claims on QPM and other coherent microscopy methods. Through this survey, we will review the most appealing and useful techniques for superresolution in coherent microscopy, working with and without lenses and with special attention to QPM.</description>

      <title>Surface Plasmon-Enhanced X-ray Ultraviolet Nonlinear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X ray matter interactions are intrinsically weak, and the high energy and momentum of X rays pose significant challenges to applying strong light matter coupling techniques that are highly effective at longer wavelengths for controlling and manipulating radiation. Techniques such as enhanced coupling between light and electrons at a metal dielectric interface or within nanostructures, as well as the Purcell effect where spontaneous emission is amplified near a metallic surface are not applicable to X rays due to their fundamentally different energy and momentum scales. Here we present a novel approach for coupling X rays to surface plasmon polaritons by entangling X ray photons with SPPs in the ultraviolet range through X ray to UV spontaneous parametric down conversion in aluminum. The distinct characteristics of the SPPs are imprinted onto the angular and energy dependence of the detected X ray photons, as demonstrated in this work. Our results highlight the potential to control X rays using SPPs, unlocking exciting opportunities to enhance X ray matter interactions and explore plasmonic phenomena with atomic scale resolution a capability uniquely enabled by X rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a novel layout providing variable zoom in digital in-line holographic microscopy (VZ-DIHM). The implementation is in virtue of an electrically tunable lens (ETL) which enables to slightly shift the illumination source axial position without mechanical movement of any system component. Magnifications ranging from 15X to 35X are easily achievable using the same layout and resulting in a substantial variation of the total field of view (FOV). The performance of the proposed setup is, first, validated using a resolution test target where the main parameters are analyzed (theoretically and experimentally) and, second, corroborated analyzing biological sample (prostate cancer cells) showing its application to biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Mode-Matched, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic Gaussian mode matched cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser ablation. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from an ideal spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, mode-matched Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser ablation processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.</description>

      <title>Fluholoscopy. Compact and Simple Platform Combining Fluorescence and Holographic Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of different imaging modalities into single imaging platforms has a strong potential in biomedical sciences since it permits the analysis of complementary properties of the target sample. Here, we report on an extremely simple, cost-effective, and compact microscope platform for achieving simultaneous fluorescence and quantitative phase imaging modes with the capability of working in a single snapshot. It is based on the use of a single illumination wavelength to both excite the sample fluorescence and provide coherent illumination for phase imaging. After passing the microscope layout, the two imaging paths are separated by using a bandpass filter and the two imaging modes are simultaneously obtained by using two digital cameras. We first present calibration and analysis of both fluorescence and phase imaging modalities working independently and, later on, experimental validation for the proposed common-path dual-mode imaging platform considering static (resolution test targets, fluorescent micro-beads and water-suspended lab-made cultures) as well as dynamic (flowing fluorescent beads, human sperm cells and live specimens from lab-made cultures) samples.</description>

      <title>Integrated electronic controller for dynamic self-configuration of photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can implement arbitrary operations and signal processing functionalities directly in the optical domain. Run-time configuration of these circuits requires an electronic control layer to adjust the working point of their building elements and make them compensate for thermal drifts or degradations of the input signal. As the advancement of photonic foundries enables the fabrication of chips of increasing complexity, developing scalable electronic controllers becomes crucial for the operation of complex PICs. In this paper, we present an electronic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for reconfiguration of PICs featuring numerous tuneable elements. Each channel of the ASIC controller independently addresses one optical component of the PIC, as multiple parallel local feedback loops are operated to achieve full control. The proposed design is validated through real-time reconfiguration of a 16-channel silicon photonics adaptive beam coupler. Results demonstrate automatic coupling of an arbitrary input beam to a single-mode waveguide, dynamic compensation of beam wavefront distortions and successful transmission of a 50 Gbit/s signal through an optical free-space link. The low power consumption and compactness of the electronic chip provide a scalable paradigm that can be seamlessly extended to larger photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Relativistic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in cylindrical waveguides and holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift electrons passing near or through metallic structures have proven to be an excellent tool for studying plasmons and other types of confined optical modes involving collective charge oscillations in the materials hybridized with electromagnetic fields. In this work, we provide a general analytical framework for the simulation of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in infinite systems with cylindrical symmetry, such as wires, holes, and optical fibers. While EELS theory is well developed for electrons moving parallel to the direction of translational symmetry, we introduce closed-form analytical solutions for perpendicular electron trajectories. These analytical results are corroborated by comparison to numerical simulations based on a frequency-domain boundary-element method and a discontinuous-Galerkin time-domain finite-element method. Numerical methods further allow us to study termination effects in finite-sized cylindrical objects such as nanorods. The present study of the interaction between free electrons and cylindrically symmetric photonics systems can find application in the analysis of EELS spectra and the design of free-electron--photonic hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion using an integrated barium-titanate transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>OpticFusion: Multi-Modal Neural Implicit 3D Reconstruction of Microstructures by Fusing White Light Interferometry and Optical Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White Light Interferometry (WLI) is a precise optical tool for measuring the 3D topography of microstructures. However, conventional WLI cannot capture the natural color of a sample's surface, which is essential for many microscale research applications that require both 3D geometry and color information. Previous methods have attempted to overcome this limitation by modifying WLI hardware and analysis software, but these solutions are often costly. In this work, we address this challenge from a computer vision multi-modal reconstruction perspective for the first time. We introduce OpticFusion, a novel approach that uses an additional digital optical microscope (OM) to achieve 3D reconstruction with natural color textures using multi-view WLI and OM images. Our method employs a two-step data association process to obtain the poses of WLI and OM data. By leveraging the neural implicit representation, we fuse multi-modal data and apply color decomposition technology to extract the sample's natural color. Tested on our multi-modal dataset of various microscale samples, OpticFusion achieves detailed 3D reconstructions with color textures. Our method provides an effective tool for practical applications across numerous microscale research fields. The source code and our real-world dataset are available at https://github.com/zju3dv/OpticFusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral structure of a photonic reservoir shapes radiation phenomena for embedded quantum emitters. We implement an all-optical analogue to study such an effect, particularly to observe the non-Markovian radiation dynamics of an emitter coupled to two-dimensional structured reservoirs. Its dynamics is simulated by light propagating through a photonic lattice, acting as a reservoir for an adjacent waveguide that mimics a coupled quantum emitter. We study radiation dynamics in square and Lieb lattices under different coupling regimes and observe how the flat band properties of the Lieb lattice significantly enhances light-matter coupling and non-Markovianity. Our platform opens a path for the experimental exploration of single photon quantum optical phenomena in structured reservoirs to enhance light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</description>

      <title>From tomography of conditional states to tomography of states that never existed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat states with photon numbers of the order of one are produced from stationary quantum-correlated fields exploiting a probabilistic heralding photon-subtraction event. The subsequent quantum state tomography provides the complete information about the state. Another approach targets measurement results on states with a significantly larger number of quantum-correlated photons by conditioning the analysis on measurement results with exactly this number of photons. Here, we present a new approach to derive measurement data of quantum correlated states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one. We produce an ensemble of a heralded, photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light. We split the states at a balanced beam splitter and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures at the outputs using tomographic `Q-function homodyne detection' (QHD). The final act is probabilistic two-copy data post-processing aiming for data from a new state with larger photon number. Evaluating the final tomographic data as that of a grown microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat state shows that the probabilistic post-processing increased the photon number of $|\alpha_0|^2 \approx 1.2$ to $|\alpha_2|^2 \approx 6.8$. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that never existed might be a turning point in measurement-based quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of an electron-hole plasma governed by strong Coulomb interaction is a challenging many-body problem.We report on experimental realization of electron-hole many-body states in the picosecond time scale, with tunable densities in a representative semiconductor Cu$_2$O. By using time-resolved optical-pump terahertz third-harmonic-generation spectroscopy, we study the nonlinear terahertz dynamical characteristics of the many-body electron-hole states. We find not only efficient and nonperturbative terahertz third-harmonic yield associated with the excitonic formation, but also a nonmonotonic dependence of the excitonic nonlinear response on the electron-hole density, reflecting the exciton dissociation at high charge density. Our results provide an efficient excitonic sensing of the far-from-equilibrium electron-hole many-body states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diffie-Hellman key exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange plays a crucial role in conventional cryptography, as it allows two legitimate users to establish a common, usually ephemeral, secret key. Its security relies on the discrete-logarithm problem, which is considered to be a mathematical one-way function, while the final key is formed by random independent actions of the two users. In the present work we investigate the extension of Diffie-Hellman key exchange to the quantum setting, where the two legitimate users exchange independent random quantum states. The proposed protocol relies on the bijective mapping of integers onto a set of symmetric coherent states, and we investigate the regime of parameters for which the map behaves as a quantum one-way function. Its security is analyzed in the framework of minimum-error-discrimination and photon-number-splitting attacks, while its performance and the challenges in a possible realization are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Advancements and Challenges in Sintering Cr4+:YAG Ceramics: A Comprehensive Review on Transparent Ceramic Technology for Q-switched Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resent progress in the technology of transparent ceramics extends the application of CW and pulsed lasers. The parameters of the transparent ceramics are comparable with the single crystals both for active elements (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, etc.) and passive Q-switchers such as Cr4+:YAG. Despite the reaching of considerable progress, the sintering of Cr4+:YAG remains a challenge up to now. Up to the present the influence of the CaO, MgO and Cr2O3 additives on the sintering process is poorly understander. Moreover, there is an absence of the unified model of Cr4+ ions formations in YAG ceramics. This factor limits the progress in the development of Cr4+:YAG ceramics. This review focused on the influence of the single additives and their combinations on the sintering trajectory of tetravalent chromium - doped YAG ceramics and the Cr4+ ions formation.</description>

      <title>Tutorial of Fourier transform for ultrafast optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20698v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial is designed for individuals who are new to the field of ultrafast optics. It was written in response to the apparent lack of comprehensive introductions to the basic Fourier transform, extending beyond the flat-phase description. Additionally, there is a need for complete derivations of several relations involving the Fourier transform, maintaining its most general formulation. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of Fourier-transform constants and ensures a complete understanding. It shows the importance of having Fourier-transform constants as parameters, which I would like to advocate people to do. Most important of all, I have seen misuse of Fourier transform over my years of discussion in the lab and from others' questions since I shared my code publicly on Github. Surprisingly, since people check the correctness of numerical implementation only by seeing if the simulation result is smooth and if it duplicates the "overall physics," this seems to be a widespread problem from my perspective, which can be solved by a simple tutorial. This is why I hope that this tutorial can help people understand more about the Fourier transform, especially in the context of ultrafast optics.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial ``zones'' with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our ``zoned discrete axisymmetry'' (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: We have proposed using laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors to search for ultralight vector and axion dark matter. Vector dark matter can be probed through oscillating forces on suspended mirrors, while axion dark matter can be detected via oscillating polarization rotation of laser beams. This paper reviews these searches with the KAGRA detector in Japan, including the first vector dark matter search with KAGRA's 2020 data and installation of polarization optics for axion dark matter search during the upcoming 2025 observing run.</description>
