      <title>An Advanced Features Extraction Module for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable advancement in the field of remote sensing image super-resolution due to the complexity and variability of textures and structures in remote sensing images (RSIs), which often repeat in the same images but differ across others. Current deep learning-based super-resolution models focus less on high-frequency features, which leads to suboptimal performance in capturing contours, textures, and spatial information. State-of-the-art CNN-based methods now focus on the feature extraction of RSIs using attention mechanisms. However, these methods are still incapable of effectively identifying and utilizing key content attention signals in RSIs. To solve this problem, we proposed an advanced feature extraction module called Channel and Spatial Attention Feature Extraction (CSA-FE) for effectively extracting the features by using the channel and spatial attention incorporated with the standard vision transformer (ViT). The proposed method trained over the UCMerced dataset on scales 2, 3, and 4. The experimental results show that our proposed method helps the model focus on the specific channels and spatial locations containing high-frequency information so that the model can focus on relevant features and suppress irrelevant ones, which enhances the quality of super-resolved images. Our model achieved superior performance compared to various existing models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Improved Interpretability in Lung and Colon Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung and colon cancer are serious worldwide health challenges that require early and precise identification to reduce mortality risks. However, diagnosis, which is mostly dependent on histopathologists' competence, presents difficulties and hazards when expertise is insufficient. While diagnostic methods like imaging and blood markers contribute to early detection, histopathology remains the gold standard, although time-consuming and vulnerable to inter-observer mistakes. Limited access to high-end technology further limits patients' ability to receive immediate medical care and diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have generated interest in its application to medical imaging analysis, specifically the use of histopathological images to diagnose lung and colon cancer. The goal of this investigation is to use and adapt existing pre-trained CNN-based models, such as Xception, DenseNet201, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, ResNet152, and InceptionResNetV2, to enhance classification through better augmentation strategies. The results show tremendous progress, with all eight models reaching impressive accuracy ranging from 97% to 99%. Furthermore, attention visualization techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, Faster Score-CAM, and LayerCAM, as well as Vanilla Saliency and SmoothGrad, are used to provide insights into the models' classification decisions, thereby improving interpretability and understanding of malignant and benign image classification.</description>

      <title>ResNCT: A Deep Learning Model for the Synthesis of Nephrographic Phase Images in CT Urography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a transformer-based deep learning model for the synthesis of nephrographic phase images in CT urography (CTU) examinations from the unenhanced and urographic phases.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A dataset of 119 patients (mean $\pm$ SD age, 65 $\pm$ 12 years; 75/44 males/females) with three-phase CT urography studies was curated for deep learning model development. The three phases for each patient were aligned with an affine registration algorithm. A custom model, coined Residual transformer model for Nephrographic phase CT image synthesis (ResNCT), was developed and implemented with paired inputs of non-contrast and urographic sets of images trained to produce the nephrographic phase images, that were compared with the corresponding ground truth nephrographic phase images. The synthesized images were evaluated with multiple performance metrics, including peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross correlation coefficient (NCC), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
  Results: The ResNCT model successfully generated synthetic nephrographic images from non-contrast and urographic image inputs. With respect to ground truth nephrographic phase images, the images synthesized by the model achieved high PSNR (27.8 $\pm$ 2.7 dB), SSIM (0.88 $\pm$ 0.05), and NCC (0.98 $\pm$ 0.02), and low MAE (0.02 $\pm$ 0.005) and RMSE (0.042 $\pm$ 0.016).
  Conclusion: The ResNCT model synthesized nephrographic phase CT images with high similarity to ground truth images. The ResNCT model provides a means of eliminating the acquisition of the nephrographic phase with a resultant 33% reduction in radiation dose for CTU examinations.</description>

      <title>Teacher-Student Network for Real-World Face Super-Resolution with Progressive Embedding of Edge Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional face super-resolution (FSR) methods trained on synthetic datasets usually have poor generalization ability for real-world face images. Recent work has utilized complex degradation models or training networks to simulate the real degradation process, but this limits the performance of these methods due to the domain differences that still exist between the generated low-resolution images and the real low-resolution images. Moreover, because of the existence of a domain gap, the semantic feature information of the target domain may be affected when synthetic data and real data are utilized to train super-resolution models simultaneously. In this study, a real-world face super-resolution teacher-student model is proposed, which considers the domain gap between real and synthetic data and progressively includes diverse edge information by using the recurrent network's intermediate outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in obtaining high-quality face images for real-world FSR.</description>

      <title>MIPI 2024 Challenge on Demosaic for HybridEVS Camera: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms has led to the widespread development and integration of advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems. However, the scarcity of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI). Building on the achievements of the previous MIPI Workshops held at ECCV 2022 and CVPR 2023, we introduce our third MIPI challenge including three tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms. In this paper, we summarize and review the Nighttime Flare Removal track on MIPI 2024. In total, 170 participants were successfully registered, and 14 teams submitted results in the final testing phase. The developed solutions in this challenge achieved state-of-the-art performance on Nighttime Flare Removal. More details of this challenge and the link to the dataset can be found at https://mipi-challenge.org/MIPI2024/.</description>

      <title>HAGAN: Hybrid Augmented Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Image Synthesis (MIS) plays an important role in the intelligent medical field, which greatly saves the economic and time costs of medical diagnosis. However, due to the complexity of medical images and similar characteristics of different tissue cells, existing methods face great challenges in meeting their biological consistency. To this end, we propose the Hybrid Augmented Generative Adversarial Network (HAGAN) to maintain the authenticity of structural texture and tissue cells. HAGAN contains Attention Mixed (AttnMix) Generator, Hierarchical Discriminator and Reverse Skip Connection between Discriminator and Generator. The AttnMix consistency differentiable regularization encourages the perception in structural and textural variations between real and fake images, which improves the pathological integrity of synthetic images and the accuracy of features in local areas. The Hierarchical Discriminator introduces pixel-by-pixel discriminant feedback to generator for enhancing the saliency and discriminance of global and local details simultaneously. The Reverse Skip Connection further improves the accuracy for fine details by fusing real and synthetic distribution features. Our experimental evaluations on three datasets of different scales, i.e., COVID-CT, ACDC and BraTS2018, demonstrate that HAGAN outperforms the existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both high-resolution and low-resolution.</description>

      <title>HC-Mamba: Vision MAMBA with Hybrid Convolutional Techniques for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation technology has the potential to expedite pathological diagnoses, thereby enhancing the efficiency of patient care. However, medical images often have complex textures and structures, and the models often face the problem of reduced image resolution and information loss due to downsampling. To address this issue, we propose HC-Mamba, a new medical image segmentation model based on the modern state space model Mamba. Specifically, we introduce the technique of dilated convolution in the HC-Mamba model to capture a more extensive range of contextual information without increasing the computational cost by extending the perceptual field of the convolution kernel. In addition, the HC-Mamba model employs depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing the number of parameters and the computational power of the model. By combining dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolutions, HC-Mamba is able to process large-scale medical image data at a much lower computational cost while maintaining a high level of performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on segmentation tasks including skin lesion, and conduct extensive experiments on ISIC17 and ISIC18 to demonstrate the potential of the HC-Mamba model in medical image segmentation. The experimental results show that HC-Mamba exhibits competitive performance on all these datasets, thereby proving its effectiveness and usefulness in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Image Classification for CSSVD Detection in Cacao Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of diseases within plants has attracted a lot of attention from computer vision enthusiasts. Despite the progress made to detect diseases in many plants, there remains a research gap to train image classifiers to detect the cacao swollen shoot virus disease or CSSVD for short, pertinent to cacao plants. This gap has mainly been due to the unavailability of high quality labeled training data. Moreover, institutions have been hesitant to share their data related to CSSVD. To fill these gaps, we propose the development of image classifiers to detect CSSVD-infected cacao plants. Our proposed solution is based on VGG16, ResNet50 and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluate the classifiers on a recently released and publicly accessible KaraAgroAI Cocoa dataset. Our best image classifier, based on ResNet50, achieves 95.39\% precision, 93.75\% recall, 94.34\% F1-score and 94\% accuracy on only 20 epochs. There is a +9.75\% improvement in recall when compared to previous works. Our results indicate that the image classifiers learn to identify cacao plants infected with CSSVD.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Refining HiRISE Image Patches Obscured by Atmospheric Dust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HiRISE (High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) is a camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter responsible for photographing vast areas of the Martian surface in unprecedented detail. It can capture millions of incredible closeup images in minutes. However, Mars suffers from frequent regional and local dust storms hampering this data-collection process, and pipeline, resulting in loss of effort and crucial flight time. Removing these images manually requires a large amount of manpower. I filter out these images obstructed by atmospheric dust automatically by using a Dust Image Classifier fine-tuned on Resnet-50 with an accuracy of 94.05%. To further facilitate the seamless filtering of Images I design a prediction pipeline that classifies and stores these dusty patches. I also denoise partially obstructed images using an Auto Encoder-based denoiser and Pix2Pix GAN with 0.75 and 0.99 SSIM Index respectively.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Saliency Prediction and Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA). However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks. IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations. On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest. Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception. In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter. Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods. All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication.</description>

      <title>TGTM: TinyML-based Global Tone Mapping for HDR Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) relying on multiple cameras are increasingly prevalent in vehicle technology. Yet, conventional imaging sensors struggle to capture clear images in conditions with intense illumination contrast, such as tunnel exits, due to their limited dynamic range. Introducing high dynamic range (HDR) sensors addresses this issue. However, the process of converting HDR content to a displayable range via tone mapping often leads to inefficient computations, when performed directly on pixel data. In this paper, we focus on HDR image tone mapping using a lightweight neural network applied on image histogram data. Our proposed TinyML-based global tone mapping method, termed as TGTM, operates at 9,000 FLOPS per RGB image of any resolution. Additionally, TGTM offers a generic approach that can be incorporated to any classical tone mapping method. Experimental results demonstrate that TGTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real HDR camera images by up to 5.85 dB higher PSNR with orders of magnitude less computations.</description>

      <title>Identifying every building's function in large-scale urban areas with multi-modality remote-sensing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings, as fundamental man-made structures in urban environments, serve as crucial indicators for understanding various city function zones. Rapid urbanization has raised an urgent need for efficiently surveying building footprints and functions. In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised framework to identify every building's function in large-scale urban areas with multi-modality remote-sensing data. In detail, optical images, building height, and nighttime-light data are collected to describe the morphological attributes of buildings. Then, the area of interest (AOI) and building masks from the volunteered geographic information (VGI) data are collected to form sparsely labeled samples. Furthermore, the multi-modality data and weak labels are utilized to train a segmentation model with a semi-supervised strategy. Finally, results are evaluated by 20,000 validation points and statistical survey reports from the government. The evaluations reveal that the produced function maps achieve an OA of 82% and Kappa of 71% among 1,616,796 buildings in Shanghai, China. This study has the potential to support large-scale urban management and sustainable urban development. All collected data and produced maps are open access at https://github.com/LiZhuoHong/BuildingMap.</description>

      <title>Picking watermarks from noise (PWFN): an improved robust watermarking model against intensive distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in a way that is undetectable to the human eye. To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer. The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image. However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks. To improve the robustness of the algorithm against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder. The module is aimed at reducing noise and recovering some of the information lost during an attack. Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency. Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities. In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.</description>

      <title>Attention-Driven Training-Free Efficiency Enhancement of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have exhibited superior performance in generating high-quality and diverse images. However, this exceptional performance comes at the cost of expensive architectural design, particularly due to the attention module heavily used in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining process to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not very scalable. To this end, we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens, without the need for any retraining. Specifically, for single-denoising-step pruning, we develop a novel ranking algorithm, Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR), to identify redundant tokens, and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for the convolution operation. In addition, we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware Pruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising timesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM performs favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g., 38.8% FLOPs saving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining nearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model.

      <title>RED-PSM: Regularization by Denoising of Factorized Low Rank Models for Dynamic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic imaging addresses the recovery of a time-varying 2D or 3D object at each time instant using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in the case of dynamic tomography, only a single projection at a single view angle may be available at a time, making the problem severely ill-posed. We propose an approach, RED-PSM, which combines for the first time two powerful techniques to address this challenging imaging problem. The first, are non-parametric factorized low rank models, also known as partially separable models (PSMs), which have been used to efficiently introduce a low-rank prior for the spatio-temporal object. The second is the recent Regularization by Denoising (RED), which provides a flexible framework to exploit the impressive performance of state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms, for various inverse problems. We propose a partially separable objective with RED and a computationally efficient and scalable optimization scheme with variable splitting and ADMM. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of our objective to a value corresponding to a stationary point satisfying the first-order optimality conditions. Convergence is accelerated by a particular projection-domain-based initialization. We demonstrate the performance and computational improvements of our proposed RED-PSM with a learned image denoiser by comparing it to a recent deep-prior-based method known as TD-DIP. Although the main focus is on dynamic tomography, we also show performance advantages of RED-PSM in a cardiac dynamic MRI setting.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to extract the sounding object from a video frame, which is represented by a pixel-wise segmentation mask for application scenarios such as multi-modal video editing, augmented reality, and intelligent robot systems. The pioneering work conducts this task through dense feature-level audio-visual interaction, which ignores the dimension gap between different modalities. More specifically, the audio clip could only provide a Global semantic label in each sequence, but the video frame covers multiple semantic objects across different Local regions, which leads to mislocalization of the representationally similar but semantically different object. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Network (C3N) to align the audio-visual semantics from the global dimension and progressively inject them into the local regions via an attention mechanism. Firstly, a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus Inference Module (C3IM) is developed to extract a unified-modal label by integrating audio/visual classification confidence and similarities of modality-agnostic label embeddings. Then, we feed the unified-modal label back to the visual backbone as the explicit semantic-level guidance via a Cognitive Consensus guided Attention Module (CCAM), which highlights the local features corresponding to the interested object. Extensive experiments on the Single Sound Source Segmentation (S4) setting and Multiple Sound Source Segmentation (MS3) setting of the AVSBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/ZhaofengSHI/AVS-C3N once accepted.</description>

      <title>Swift Parameter-free Attention Network for Efficient Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in low-level computer vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts. Conventional attention mechanisms have significantly improved SISR performance but often result in complex network structures and large number of parameters, leading to slow inference speed and large model size. To address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network (SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed, achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. Notably, we won the first place both in the overall performance track and runtime track of the NTIRE 2024 efficient super-resolution challenge. Our code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/hongyuanyu/SPAN.</description>

      <title>Hundred-Kilobyte Lookup Tables for Efficient Single-Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional super-resolution (SR) schemes make heavy use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which involve intensive multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, and require specialized hardware such as graphics processing units. This contradicts the regime of edge AI that often runs on devices strained by power, computing, and storage resources. Such a challenge has motivated a series of lookup table (LUT)-based SR schemes that employ simple LUT readout and largely elude CNN computation. Nonetheless, the multi-megabyte LUTs in existing methods still prohibit on-chip storage and necessitate off-chip memory transport. This work tackles this storage hurdle and innovates hundred-kilobyte LUT (HKLUT) models amenable to on-chip cache. Utilizing an asymmetric two-branch multistage network coupled with a suite of specialized kernel patterns, HKLUT demonstrates an uncompromising performance and superior hardware efficiency over existing LUT schemes. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/jasonli0707/hklut.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an Adversarial Attack Against a Multimodal Vision Language Model for Pathology Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of medical artificial intelligence, this study explores the vulnerabilities of the Pathology Language-Image Pretraining (PLIP) model, a Vision Language Foundation model, under targeted attacks. Leveraging the Kather Colon dataset with 7,180 H&amp;E images across nine tissue types, our investigation employs Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial perturbation attacks to induce misclassifications intentionally. The outcomes reveal a 100% success rate in manipulating PLIP's predictions, underscoring its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. The qualitative analysis of adversarial examples delves into the interpretability challenges, shedding light on nuanced changes in predictions induced by adversarial manipulations. These findings contribute crucial insights into the interpretability, domain adaptation, and trustworthiness of Vision Language Models in medical imaging. The study emphasizes the pressing need for robust defenses to ensure the reliability of AI models.

      <title>Rethinking Model Prototyping through the MedMNIST+ Dataset Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning based systems in clinical practice is often impeded by challenges rooted in limited and heterogeneous medical datasets. In addition, prioritization of marginal performance improvements on a few, narrowly scoped benchmarks over clinical applicability has slowed down meaningful algorithmic progress. This trend often results in excessive fine-tuning of existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on selected datasets rather than fostering clinically relevant innovations. In response, this work presents a comprehensive benchmark for the MedMNIST+ database to diversify the evaluation landscape and conduct a thorough analysis of common convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures, for medical image classification. Our evaluation encompasses various medical datasets, training methodologies, and input resolutions, aiming to reassess the strengths and limitations of widely used model variants. Our findings suggest that computationally efficient training schemes and modern foundation models hold promise in bridging the gap between expensive end-to-end training and more resource-refined approaches. Additionally, contrary to prevailing assumptions, we observe that higher resolutions may not consistently improve performance beyond a certain threshold, advocating for the use of lower resolutions, particularly in prototyping stages, to expedite processing. Notably, our analysis reaffirms the competitiveness of convolutional models compared to ViT-based architectures emphasizing the importance of comprehending the intrinsic capabilities of different model architectures. Moreover, we hope that our standardized evaluation framework will help enhance transparency, reproducibility, and comparability on the MedMNIST+ dataset collection as well as future research within the field.

      <title>Deep-learning-driven end-to-end metalens imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in metasurface lenses (metalenses) have shown great potential for opening a new era in compact imaging, photography, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. However, the fundamental trade-off between broadband focusing efficiency and operating bandwidth limits the performance of broadband metalenses, resulting in chromatic aberration, angular aberration, and a relatively low efficiency. In this study, a deep-learning-based image restoration framework is proposed to overcome these limitations and realize end-to-end metalens imaging, thereby achieving aberration-free full-color imaging for mass-produced metalenses with 10-mm diameter. Neural-network-assisted metalens imaging achieved a high resolution comparable to that of the ground truth image.</description>

      <title>Investigating Self-Supervised Image Denoising with Denaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</description>
