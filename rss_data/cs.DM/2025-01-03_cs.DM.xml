      <title>Twin-width one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of graphs of twin-width at most $1$, and obtain the following results:
  - Graphs of twin-width at most $1$ are permutation graphs. In particular they have an intersection model and a linear structure.
  - There is always a $1$-contraction sequence closely following a given permutation diagram.
  - Based on a recursive decomposition theorem, we obtain a simple algorithm running in linear time that produces a $1$-contraction sequence of a graph, or guarantees that it has twin-width more than $1$.
  - We characterise distance-hereditary graphs based on their twin-width and deduce a linear time algorithm to compute optimal sequences on this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Demigod's Number for the Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known by now that any state of the $3\times 3 \times 3$ Rubik's Cube can be solved in at most 20 moves, a result often referred to as "God's Number". However, this result took Rokicki et al. around 35 CPU years to prove and is therefore very challenging to reproduce.
  We provide a novel approach to obtain a worse bound of 36 moves with high confidence, but that offers two main advantages: (i) it is easy to understand, reproduce, and verify, and (ii) our main idea generalizes to bounding the diameter of other vertex-transitive graphs by at most twice its true value, hence the name "demigod number".
  Our approach is based on the fact that, for vertex-transitive graphs, the average distance between vertices is at most half the diameter, and by sampling uniformly random states and using a modern solver to obtain upper bounds on their distance, a standard concentration bound allows us to confidently state that the average distance is around $18.32 \pm 0.1$, from where the diameter is at most $36$.</description>

      <title>Alon-Tarsi for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, define for every edge $e\in E$ a linear expression with arguments corresponding with the vertices. Next, let the polynomial $p_H$ be the product of such linear expressions for all edges. Our main goal was to find a relationship between the Alon-Tarsi number of $p_H$ and the edge density of $H$. We prove that $AT(p_H)=\lceil ed(H)\rceil+1$ if all the coefficients in $p_H$ are equal to $1$. Our main result is that, no matter what those coefficients are, they can be permuted within the edges so that for the resulting polynomial $p_H^\prime$, $AT(p_H^\prime)\leq 2\lceil ed(H)\rceil+1$ holds. We conjecture that, in fact, permuting the coefficients is not necessary. If this were true, then in particular a significant generalization of the famous 1-2-3 Conjecture would follow.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is \NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>Cloitre's Self-Generating Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2009 Benoit Cloitre introduced a certain self-generating sequence $$(a_n)_{n\geq 1} = 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, \ldots,$$ with the property that the sum of the terms appearing in the $n$'th run equals twice the $n$'th term of the sequence. We give a connection between this sequence and the paperfolding sequence, and then prove Cloitre's conjecture about the density of $1$'s appearing in $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$.</description>

      <title>Sublinear-Time Computation in the Presence of Online Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of sublinear-time algorithms that access their input via an online adversarial erasure oracle. After answering each input query, such an oracle can erase $t$ input values. Our goal is to understand the complexity of basic computational tasks in extremely adversarial situations, where the algorithm's access to data is blocked during the execution of the algorithm in response to its actions. Specifically, we focus on property testing in the model with online erasures. We show that two fundamental properties of functions, linearity and quadraticity, can be tested for constant $t$ with asymptotically the same complexity as in the standard property testing model. For linearity testing, we prove tight bounds in terms of $t$, showing that the query complexity is $\Theta(\log t).$ In contrast to linearity and quadraticity, some other properties, including sortedness and the Lipschitz property of sequences, cannot be tested at all, even for $t=1$. Our investigation leads to a deeper understanding of the structure of violations of linearity and other widely studied properties. We also consider implications of our results for algorithms that are resilient to online adversarial corruptions instead of erasures.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional Ramsey Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramsey theory is a central and active branch of combinatorics. Although Ramsey numbers for graphs have been extensively investigated since Ramsey's work in the 1930s, there is still an exponential gap between the best known lower and upper bounds. For $k$-uniform hypergraphs, the bounds are of tower-type, where the height grows with $k$. Here, we give a multidimensional generalisation of Ramsey's Theorem to Cartesian products of graphs, proving that a doubly exponential upper bound suffices in every dimension. More precisely, we prove that for every positive integers $r,n,d$, in any $r$-colouring of the edges of the Cartesian product $\square^{d} K_N$ of $d$ copies of $K_N$, there is a copy of $\square^{d} K_n$ such that the edges in each direction are monochromatic, provided that $N\geq 2^{2^{C_drn^{d}}}$. As an application of our approach we also obtain improvements on the multidimensional Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem proved by Fishburn and Graham $30$ years ago. Their bound was recently improved by Buci\'c, Sudakov, and Tran, who gave an upper bound that is triply exponential in four or more dimensions. We improve upon their results showing that a doubly expoenential upper bounds holds any number of dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the number of partitions of the hypercube ${\bf Z}_q^n$ into large subcubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the number of partitions of the hypercube ${\bf Z}_q^n$ into $q^m$ subcubes of dimension $n-m$ each for fixed $q$, $m$ and growing $n$ is asymptotically equal to $n^{(q^m-1)/(q-1)}$. For the proof, we introduce the operation of the bang of a star matrix and demonstrate that any star matrix, except for a fractal, is expandable under some bang, whereas a fractal remains to be a fractal under any bang.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions via Complex Extensions of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic properties of partition functions, particularly the location of zeros, through the lens of rapidly mixing Markov chains. The classical Lee-Yang program initiated the study of phase transitions via locating complex zeros of partition functions. Markov chains, besides serving as algorithms, have also been used to model physical processes tending to equilibrium. In many scenarios, rapid mixing of Markov chains coincides with the absence of phase transitions (complex zeros). Prior works have shown that the absence of phase transitions implies rapid mixing of Markov chains. We reveal a converse connection by lifting probabilistic tools for the analysis of Markov chains to study complex zeros of partition functions.
  Our motivating example is the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs, where the best-known zero-free regime has been significantly lagging behind the regime where we have rapidly mixing Markov chains for the underlying hypergraph independent sets. Specifically, the Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly on independent sets in a $k$-uniform hypergraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided that $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$. On the other hand, the best-known zero-freeness around the point $1$ of the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs requires $\Delta \le 5$, the same bound as on a graph.
  By introducing a complex extension of Markov chains, we lift an existing percolation argument to the complex plane, and show that if $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$, the Markov chain converges in a complex neighborhood, and the independence polynomial itself does not vanish in the same neighborhood. In the same regime, our result also implies central limit theorems for the size of a uniformly random independent set, and deterministic approximation algorithms for the number of hypergraph independent sets of size $k \le \alpha n$ for some constant $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Outerplanar and Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of planar graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs or the class of the planar graphs. In both cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Runs in Paperfolding Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paperfolding sequences form an uncountable class of infinite sequences over the alphabet $\{ -1, 1 \}$ that describe the sequence of folds arising from iterated folding of a piece of paper, followed by unfolding. In this note we observe that the sequence of run lengths in such a sequence, as well as the starting and ending positions of the $n$'th run, is $2$-synchronized and hence computable by a finite automaton. As a specific consequence, we obtain the recent results of Bunder, Bates, and Arnold, in much more generality, via a different approach. We also prove results about the critical exponent and subword complexity of these run-length sequences.</description>
