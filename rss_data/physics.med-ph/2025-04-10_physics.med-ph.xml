      <title>A quantum computing approach to beam angle optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Beam angle optimization (BAO) is a critical component of radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning, where small changes in beam configuration can significantly impact treatment quality, especially for proton RT. Mathematically, BAO is a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, which is NP-hard due to its exponential growing search space. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle with computational efficiency, necessitating the development of novel approaches. Purpose: This study introduces QC-BAO, a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages quantum computing to solve the MIP formulation of BAO. Methods: The proposed approach, QC-BAO, models BAO as an MIP problem, incorporating binary variables for beam angle selection and continuous variables for optimizing spot intensities for proton therapy. The proposed approach employs a hybrid quantum-classical framework, utilizing quantum computing to solve the binary decision component while integrating classical optimization techniques, including iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Computational experiments were conducted on clinical test cases to evaluate QC-BAO's performance against clinically verified angles and a heuristic approach, GS-BAO. QC-BAO demonstrated improved treatment plan quality over both clinical and GS-BAO. The method consistently increased the conformity index (CI) for target coverage while reducing mean and maximum doses to organs-at-risk (OAR). Additionally, QC-BAO produced the lowest objective function value, confirming its superior optimization capability. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to enhance the solution to BAO problem by demonstrated improvement in plan quality using the proposed method, QC-BAO. This study paves the way for future clinical implementation of quantum-accelerated optimization in RT.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Dosimetric Validation of Deformable Image Registration for Prostate MR-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Quantify geometric and dosimetric accuracy of a novel prostate MR-to-MR deformable image registration (DIR) approach to support MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy dose accumulation.
  Approach: We evaluated DIR accuracy in 25 patients treated with 30 Gy in 5 fractions on a 1.5 T MR-linac using an adaptive workflow. A reference MR was used for planning, with three images collected at each fraction: adapt MR for adaptive planning, verify MR for pretreatment position verification and beam-on for capturing anatomy during radiation delivery. We assessed three DIR approaches: intensity-based, intensity-based with controlling structures (CS) and novel intensity based with controlling structures and points of interest (CS+P). DIRs were performed between the reference and fraction images and within fractions. We propagated CTV, bladder, and rectum contours using the DIRs and compared to manual contours using Dice similarity coefficient, mean distance to agreement (DTAmean), and dose-volume metrics.
  Results: CS and CS+P improved geometric agreement between contours over intensity-only DIR. DTAmean for reference-to-beam-on intensity-only DIR was 0.131+/-0.009cm (CTV), 0.46+/-0.08cm (bladder), and 0.154+/-0.013cm (rectum). For the CS, the values were 0.018+/-0.002cm, 0.388+/-0.14cm, and 0.036+/-0.013cm. For CS+P these values were 0.015+/-0.001cm, 0.025+/-0.004cm, and 0.021+/-0.002cm. Dosimetrically, comparing CS and CS+P for reference to beam-on DIRs resulted in a change of CTV D98% from [-29cGy, 19cGy] to [-18cGy, 26cGy], rectum D1cc from [-106cGy, 72cGy] to [-52cGy, 74cGy], and bladder D5cc from [-51cGy, 544cGy] to [-79cGy, 36cGy].
  Significance: CS improved geometric and dosimetric accuracy over intensity-only DIR, with CS+P providing the most consistent performance. However, session image segmentation remains a challenge, which may be addressed with automated contouring.</description>

      <title>Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II Detection Using Cross Modality Transfer Learning and Grad-CAM in 3D-CNNs for MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, often curable only by surgery. Despite its clinical importance, the diagnosis of FCD is very difficult in MRI because of subtle abnormalities, leading to misdiagnosis. This study investigates the use of 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for FCD detection, using a dataset of 170 subjects (85 FCD patients and 85 controls) composed of T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI scans. In particular, it investigates the benefits obtained from cross-modality transfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, in particular Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, -34, and -50) were implemented, employing transfer learning strategies that used pre-trained weights from segmentation tasks. Results indicate that transfer learning significantly enhances classification accuracy (up to 80.3%) and interpretability, as measured by a novel Heat-Score metric, which evaluates the model's focus on clinically relevant regions. Improvements in the Heat-Score metric underscore the model's seizure zone localization capabilities, bringing AI predictions and clinical insights closer together. These results highlight the importance of transfer learning, including cross-modality, and XAI in advancing AI-based medical diagnostics, especially for difficult-to-diagnose pathologies such as FCD.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each case across a variety of radiation doses and LETs. Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 versus LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects induced by high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for establishing mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different doses and LETs.</description>

      <title>Neutron Beam Shaping by Ghost Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on ``ghost projection'', which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of sub-mask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam ``on demand'' allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies.</description>
