      <title>Trends in porous media laboratory imaging and open science practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding processes in porous media is fundamental to a broad spectrum of environmental, energy, and geoscience applications. These processes include multiphase fluid transport, interfacial dynamics, reactive transformations, and interactions with solids or microbial components, all governed by wettability, capillarity, and reactive transport at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Laboratory-based multiscale imaging provides critical insights into these phenomena, enabling direct visualization and quantitative characterization from the nanometer to meter scale. It is essential for advancing predictive models and optimizing the design of subsurface and engineered porous systems. This review presents an integrated overview of imaging techniques relevant to porous media research, emphasizing the type of information each method can provide, their applicability to porous media systems, and their inherent limitations. We highlight how imaging data are combined with quantitative analyses and modeling to bridge pore-scale mechanisms with continuum-scale behavior, and we critically discuss current challenges such as limited spatio-temporal resolution, sample representativity, and restricted data accessibility. We conduct an in-depth analysis on open-science trends in experimental and computational porous media research and find that, while open-access publishing has become widespread, the availability of imaging data and analysis code remains limited, often restricted to 'upon request'. Finally, we underscore the importance of open sharing of imaging datasets to enable reproducibility, foster cross-disciplinary integration, and support the development of robust predictive frameworks for porous media systems.</description>

      <title>Representing Subgrid-Scale Cloud Effects in a Radiation Parameterization using Machine Learning: MLe-radiation v1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvements of Machine Learning (ML)-based radiation emulators remain constrained by the underlying assumptions to represent horizontal and vertical subgrid-scale cloud distributions, which continue to introduce substantial uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a method to represent the impact of subgrid-scale clouds by applying ML to learn processes from high-resolution model output with a horizontal grid spacing of 5km. In global storm resolving models, clouds begin to be explicitly resolved. Coarse-graining these high-resolution simulations to the resolution of coarser Earth System Models yields radiative heating rates that implicitly include subgrid-scale cloud effects, without assumptions about their horizontal or vertical distributions. We define the cloud radiative impact as the difference between all-sky and clear-sky radiative fluxes, and train the ML component solely on this cloud-induced contribution to heating rates. The clear-sky tendencies remain being computed with a conventional physics-based radiation scheme. This hybrid design enhances generalization, since the machine-learned part addresses only subgrid-scale cloud effects, while the clear-sky component remains responsive to changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations. Applied to coarse-grained data offline, the ML-enhanced radiation scheme reduces errors by a factor of 4-10 compared with a conventional coarse-scale radiation scheme. This shows the potential of representing subgrid-scale cloud effects in radiation schemes with ML for the next generation of Earth System Models.</description>

      <title>Surface to Seafloor: A Generative AI Framework for Decoding the Ocean Interior State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding subsurface ocean dynamics is essential for quantifying oceanic heat and mass transport, but direct observations at depth remain sparse due to logistical and technological constraints. In contrast, satellite missions provide rich surface datasets-such as sea surface height, temperature, and salinity-that offer indirect but potentially powerful constraints on the ocean interior. Here, we present a probabilistic framework based on score-based diffusion models to reconstruct three-dimensional subsurface velocity and buoyancy fields, including the energetic ocean eddy field, from surface observations. Using a 15-level primitive equation simulation of an idealized double-gyre system, we evaluate the skill of the model in inferring the mean circulation and the mesoscale variability at depth under varying levels of surface information. We find that the generative model successfully recovers key dynamical structures and provides physically meaningful uncertainty estimates, with predictive skill diminishing systematically as the surface resolution decreases or the inference depth increases. These results demonstrate the potential of generative approaches for ocean state estimation and uncertainty quantification, particularly in regimes where traditional deterministic methods are underconstrained or ill-posed.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the presence of NSI at INO-ICAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>
