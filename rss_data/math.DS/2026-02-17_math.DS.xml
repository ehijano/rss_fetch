      <title>Bruno ideal and the variety of centers for singular germs of vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a logarithmic analytic vector field $\partial$, we consider the formal ideal $B(\partial)$ defined by the collinearity locus of the semi-simple and nilpotent components of~$\partial$. Assuming that the eigenvalues of the linear part of $\partial$ satisfy the so-called Bruno arithmetic condition, we prove that $B(\partial)$ is in fact an analytic ideal. Moreover, $\partial$ is analytically normalizable when restricted to this ideal. As a consequence, the vanishing locus $V$ of $B(\partial)$ is an analytic variety, and the foliation defined by $\partial|_{V}$ is analytically linearizable.</description>

      <title>Caputo mean-square attractors for non-autonomous stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Caputo mean-square attractors for non-autonomous stochastic evolution systems. We first introduce the concept of Caputo mean-square attractors and then establish a sufficient criterion for existence of such attractors.As an application, we consider a non-autonomous Caputo fractional stochastic differential equation of order $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ in $L^2(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)$ with a driving system on a compact base space $P$ and tempered fractional noise.It is shown that this equation generates a Caputo mean-square random semi-dynamical system on $\mathfrak{C} \times P$ with a skew-product semi-flow structure,where $\mathfrak{C}$ denotes the space of continuous functions $f\in \mathbb{R}^{+}\rightarrow L^2(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)$. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this semi-dynamical system admits a Caputo mean-square attractor.</description>

      <title>Speedups of linearly recurrent subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A speedup, like a time change in discrete time dynamics, is a way of moving faster through the orbits of a dynamical system. Linearly recurrence is a stronger form of minimality for subshifts, shared by e.g.\ all primitive substitution shifts and Sturmian shifts associated with rotation numbers of bounded type. We prove that the homeomorphic speedup of a linearly recurrent two-sided subshift is again linearly recurrent.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to periodic orbits in the $e^{-}Z^{2+}e^{-}$ Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we use variational approaches to describe generalized solutions $(q_1,q_2)$ and critical points $(z_1,z_2)$ of the action functional $\mathscr{B}_{av}$ for the Helium atom in the $e^{-}Z^{2+}e^{-}$ configuration with mean interaction, where $(q_1,q_2)$ and $(z_1,z_2)$ are related by a non-local Levi-Civita regularization introduced by Barutello, Ortega and Verzini. Additionally, we give the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations of the generalized solutions $(q_1,q_2)$ following the framework constructed by Cieliebak, Frauenfelder and Volkov. Finally, we count the number of periodic orbits $(z_1,z_2)\in \mathscr{C}_{\mathscr{B}_{av}}$ and find the 1-to-1 correspondence between them and positive rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}_{+}$. \rm</description>

      <title>Data-driven macroscopic dynamics of complex networks using Topological Data Analysis and the Equation-Free Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computational framework for exploring and analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of complex agent-based network models by integrating Topological Data Analysis with the Equation-Free Method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi-type random networks. Central to our approach is a Topological Data Analysis-based filtration process driven by the density of activated network nodes (agents), from which we extract a coarse-grained macroscopic topological observable. This observable is defined via persistent Betti numbers, thus requiring significantly reduced data dimensionality while retaining essential topological features. Subsequently, within the Equation-Free Method framework, we show firstly that a \textit{lifting procedure} can be achieved using topological properties and secondly, a data-driven evolution law that governs the dynamics of this macroscopic variable. Finally, we perform a numerical bifurcation and stability analysis to investigate the global behavior and qualitative transitions of the emergent macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Lipschitz equivalence of finite-dimensional linear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two flows on a finite-dimensional normed space $X$ are Lipschitz equivalent if some homeomorphism $h$ of $X$ that is bi-Lipschitz near the origin preserves all orbits, i.e., $h$ maps each orbit onto an orbit. A complete classification by Lipschitz equivalence is established for all linear flows on $X$, in terms of basic linear algebra properties of their generators. Utilizing equivalence instead of the much more restrictive conjugacy, the classification theorem significantly extends known results. The analysis is entirely elementary though somewhat intricate. It highlights, more clearly than does the existing literature, the fundamental roles played by linearity and finite-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution speed of iterated preimages for rational maps on the Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential equidistribution speed of iterated preimages for holomorphic endomorphisms on $\mathbb{P}^k$ was established by Drasin-Okuyama for $k=1$, and by Dinh-Sibony for arbitrary $k$. In this paper, we obtain a near-optimal equidistribution speed with order $O(nd^{-n})$ in dimension one for points that are not super-attracting periodic. For geometrically finite rational maps (including all hyperbolic rational maps), we prove that the equidistribution speed order is $O(d^{-n})$ for points that are not super-attracting, attracting, or parabolic periodic.</description>

      <title>Convergence and combinatorics of the Reverse algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Reverse algorithm, a multidimensional continued fraction algorithm, which is not unimodular. We show that the Reverse algorithm is ergodic and, by proving that its second Lyapunov exponent is negative, that it is a.e. exponentially convergent. In addition to that, we attach substitutions to this algorithm and study the $S$-adic languages generated by sequences of these substitutions. The negativity of the second Lyapunov exponent implies that almost all of these languages are balanced. By a thorough study of the combinatorics of the substitutions, we are even able to obtain a concrete generic family of balanced languages that is characterized in terms of a simple condition on the underlying sequence of substitutions.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic tangency of codimension 2 and historic wandering domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional diffeomorphism exhibiting a homoclinic tangency of the largest codimension, which admits a historic wandering domain of positive Lebesgue measure. Every orbit in this wandering domain exhibits historic behavior, in the sense that time averages do not converge. This example shows that homoclinic tangencies of the largest codimension can still give rise to positive Lebesgue measure sets with non-convergent statistical behavior.</description>

      <title>Propagation of regularity along unstable manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi_t : M \to M$ be a flow on a smooth closed connected manifold $M$ that preserves and expands a foliation $F$. We establish a theorem of propagation of regularity along the leaves of $F$ for sections of vector bundles satisfying a transport equation involving the generator of a cocycle over $\varphi_t$. As a consequence, we prove a regularity result for Pollicott-Ruelle resonant states: if such state is smooth in restriction to a piece of an unstable leaf, then it is in fact smooth over the entire manifold. We also announce further applications related to joint integrability of extreme bundles of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. The proofs rely on a leafwise semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus adapted to a foliated space, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Learning Gradient Flow: Using Equation Discovery to Accelerate Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of data-driven equation discovery for dynamical systems to model and forecast continuous-time dynamics of unconstrained optimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Periodic Solutions with Applications to Extremum-Seeking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides two results that are useful in the study of the existence and the stability properties of a periodic solution for a given dynamical system. The first result deals with scalar time-periodic systems and establishes the equivalence of the existence of a periodic solution and the existence of a bounded solution. The second result provides sufficient conditions for the existence and the stability of a periodic solution for a time-periodic dynamical system. Both results are applied to extremum seeking problems for a static output map with no plant dynamics and novel non-local results are provided without the use of averaging theorems and singular perturbation arguments.</description>

      <title>From time series to dissipativity of linear systems with dynamic supply rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of verifying dissipativity of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using input-output data. We leverage behavioral systems theory to express dissipativity in terms of quadratic difference forms (QDFs), allowing the study of general dynamic quadratic supply rates. We work under the assumptions that the data-generating system is controllable, and an upper bound is given on its lag. As our main results, we provide sufficient conditions for the data to be informative for dissipativity. We also show that for a specific class of static supply rates, these conditions are both necessary and sufficient. For the latter supply rates, it turns out that certification of dissipativity is only possible from data that enable unique system identification. As auxiliary results, we highlight some properties of QDFs, such as upper bounds on the degree of storage functions.</description>

      <title>Finitary coding and Gaussian concentration for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaussian concentration inequalities for random fields obtained as finitary codings of i.i.d.\ processes, establishing a natural bridge between finitary codings and concentration inequalities. A finitary coding formalizes how a random field with nontrivial dependence, such as the Ising model, can be generated from an i.i.d.\ source by a shift-equivariant map that determines each output spin from a finite, configuration-dependent window of the input. Gaussian concentration yields uniform sub-Gaussian fluctuation bounds for all local observables.
  Our main abstract result shows that Gaussian concentration is preserved under finitary codings of i.i.d.\ fields provided the coding volume has finite second moment. The proof relies on a refinement of the classical worst-case bounded-differences inequality of Talagrand and Marton, allowing us to exploit configuration-dependent bounds. Under an additional structural condition that we call the short-range factorization property, satisfied in particular by codings constructed via coupling-from-the-past algorithms, finite first moment of the coding volume already suffices. These moment conditions are sharp.
  Applications include Gibbs measures and Markov random fields on $\mathbb Z^d$, probabilistic cellular automata, and one-dimensional stochastic processes. For classical lattice models such as the Ising, Potts, and random-cluster models, we obtain sharp criteria for Gaussian concentration coinciding with uniqueness regimes. For countable-state Markov chains, we derive equivalent characterizations, including geometric ergodicity, exponential return-time tails, and the existence of finitary i.i.d.\ codings with exponential tails.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Step Model Predictive Control for Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14714v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under time-varying directed communication, state and input constraints using a distributed multi-step model predictive control (MPC) framework. Consensus is recast as stabilization of the agreement set, and a geometric viewpoint based on convex-hull invariance and strict interiority is adopted. Building on an existing geometric necessary and sufficient condition for agreement, we show that enforcing terminal inclusion in local neighbor convex hulls guarantees hull invariance but does not, in general, imply the strict relative-interior property required for convergence. An explicit counterexample demonstrates that strictness cannot be deduced from feasibility and contraction constraints alone.
  To resolve this issue without shrinking feasible sets or altering primary performance objectives, a lexicographic tie-breaking mechanism is introduced. Among optimal (or near-optimal) MPC solutions, the proposed secondary criterion selects trajectories maximizing an interiority measure with respect to the neighbor hull. It is shown that whenever an interior feasible terminal state exists, this selection rule enforces the strictness condition required for asymptotic consensus. Explicit horizon conditions are derived for single- and double-integrator agents with bounded inputs, ensuring feasibility and automatic existence of interior feasible terminal points. The resulting scheme provides a distributed and implementable route to consensus via finite-step set-Lyapunov contraction. Numerical simulations with distributed inter-process communication illustrate monotone diameter decay and report per-agent computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: Given $\beta\in(1,2]$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_\beta(x)=\beta x\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the open interval $(0,t)$. Kalle et al. proved in [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. So there exists a critical value $\tau(\beta)$ such that $\dim_H K_\beta(t)&gt;0$ if and only if $t&lt;\tau(\beta)$. In this paper we determine the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, answering a question of Kalle et al. (2020). For example, we find that for the Komornik-Loreti constant $\beta\approx 1.78723$ we have $\tau(\beta)=(2-\beta)/(\beta-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps, with $\tau(1+)=0$ and $\tau(2)=1/2$; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. Our strategy to find the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ depends on certain substitutions of Farey words and a renormalization scheme from dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for transitive local diffeomorphism with break points on the circle and Holder continuous potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that if $f: \mathbb{S}^{1} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{1}$ is a transitive $C^{1+\alpha}$-local diffeomorphism non-invertible and non-uniformly expanding, then there is a unique parameter $t_{0} \in (0 , 1]$ such that the topological pressure function $\mathbb{R} \ni t \mapsto P_{top}(f , -t\log|Df|)$ is not analytic, in particular $f$ has a phase transition with respect to potential $\phi := -\log|Df|$. On the other hand, it is known that for continuous potentials, the topological pressure function can exhibit an infinite number of phase transitions. In this paper, we study the possibilities of the behaviour of the topological pressure function and transfer operator for transitive local diffeomorphism with break points on the circle and H\"older continuous potentials. In particular, we showed that: (1) there is an open and dense subset of continuous potentials such that if a H\"older continuous potential belongs to this subset, then it has no phase transition and the transfer operator has the spectral gap property; (2) if a H\"older continuous potential has a phase transition, then the topological pressure function and the associated transfer operator are described. Consequently, every H\"older continuous potential has at most two phase transitions and the set of smooth potentials such that $\mathcal{L}_{f,\phi}$ has the spectral gap property, acting on the H\"older continuous space, is dense in the uniform topology. Furthermore, we obtain applications for multifractal analysis of the Birkhoff average.</description>

      <title>On balance properties of hypercubic billiard words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies balance properties for billiard words. Billiard words generalize Sturmian words by coding trajectories in hypercubic billiards. In the setting of aperiodic order, they also provide the simplest examples of quasicrystals, as tilings of the line obtained via cut and project sets with a cubical canonical window.
  By construction, the number of occurrences of each letter in a factor (i.e., a string of consecutive letters) of a hypercubic billiard word only depends on the length of the factor, up to an additive constant. In other words, the difference of the number of occurrences of each letter in factors of the same length is bounded.
  In contrast with the behaviour of letters, we prove the existence of words that are not balanced in billiard words: the difference of the number of occurrences of such unbalanced factors in longer factors of the same length is unbounded. The proof relies both on topological methods inspired by tiling cohomology and on arithmetic results on bounded remainder sets for toral translations.</description>

      <title>Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.</description>

      <title>Equality of H\"older exponents for distribution functions of Gibbs measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pointwise H\"older exponents describe the degree of regularity of a function near a point. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, a number $\alpha&gt;0$ and a point $t_0\in\mathbb{R}$, write $f\in C^\alpha(t_0)$ if there is a constant $C$ and a polynomial $P$ of degree less than $\alpha$ such that \[ |f(t)-P(t-t_0)|\leq C|t-t_0|^\alpha \qquad\mbox{for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$}. \] The pointwise H\"older exponent of $f$ at $t_0$ is the number \[ \alpha_f(t_0):=\sup\{\alpha&gt;0: f\in C^\alpha(t_0)\}. \] A simpler quantity, also frequently called pointwise H\"older exponent in the mathematical literature, is the number \[ \tilde{\alpha}_f(t_0):=\sup\{\alpha&gt;0: f\in \tilde{C}^\alpha(t_0)\}, \] where $f\in \tilde{C}^\alpha(t_0)$ means that there is a constant $C&gt;0$ such that $|f(t)-f(t_0)|\leq C|t-t_0|^\alpha$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. Clearly $\alpha_f(t)\geq \tilde{\alpha}_f(t)$, but strict inequality is possible and in fact common. In this paper we consider the case when $f=F_\mu$ is the distribution function of a Gibbs measure $\mu$ associated with an arbitrary H\"older continuous potential $\psi$ on a self-conformal set, and show that, under a very mild condition on $\psi$, $\alpha_f(t)=\tilde{\alpha}_f(t)$ for all $t$. As a consequence, we deduce that the pointwise H\"older spectrum of $f$ satisfies the multifractal formalism. As an application, we derive the pointwise H\"older spectrum of conjugacy maps between expanding piecewise $\mathcal{C}^{1+\epsilon}$ maps of an interval.</description>

      <title>Weak Gibbs measures for the natural extension of $(\kappa/\beta, \beta)$-shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the weak Gibbs measures for $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts. In the case of $\alpha=0$, Pfister and Sullivan have given a necessary and sufficient condition on $\beta$ such that any equilibrium measure for a function of bounded total oscillations is a weak Gibbs measure in the natural extension of a $\beta$-shift. So it is natural to ask what happens when $\alpha&gt;0$. However, their proof cannot be applied to general $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts in a similar way. In this paper we consider the case of $\alpha=\kappa/\beta$ and give a criterion for the weak Gibbs property of equilibrium measures for $(\kappa/\beta, \beta)$-shifts.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory on clustering in spontaneous particle aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of short-term and long-term memory on spontaneous aggregation of organisms is investigated using a stochastic agent-based model. Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Beyond real blow-up: Masuda detours and complex holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For real $\mathbf{b}$, consider quadratic heat equations like \begin{equation*} \mathbf{w}_t=\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{\xi}\boldsymbol{\xi}} + \mathbf{b}(\boldsymbol{\xi})\,\mathbf{w}^2 \end{equation*} on $\boldsymbol{\xi}\in(0,\pi)$ with Neumann boundary conditions. For $\mathbf{b}$=1, pioneering work by Ky\^uya Masuda in the 1980s aimed to circumvent PDE blow-up, which occurs in finite real time, by a detour which ventures through complex time. Naive projection onto the first two Galerkin modes $\mathbf{w}=x+y \cos\boldsymbol{\xi}$ leads us to an ODE caricature. As in the PDE, spatially homogeneous solutions $y=0\neq x\in\mathbb{R}$ starting at $x_0$ blow up at finite real time $t=T=1/x_0$. We aim for ODE "linearization at infinity".
  Since iterated complex time loops are not feasible, for parabolic PDEs, our PDE-motivated approach is currently limited to ODEs. On the other hand, all ODE results of the present paper exactly embed into certain PDEs of parabolic type, which possess a PDE-invariant Galerkin subspace.
  In the spirit of Masuda, we extend real analytic ODE solutions to complex time, and to real 4-dimensional $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, to circumvent the real blow-up singularity at $t=T$. We therefore study complex foliations of general polynomial ODEs for $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, in projective compactifications like $u=1/x,\ z=y/x$, including their holonomy at blow-up $u=0$. We obtain linearizations, at blow-up equilibria of Poincar\'e and Siegel type, based on spectral nonresonance. We discuss the consequences of rational periodic nonresonance, and of irrational quasiperiodic nonresonance of Diophantine type, for iterated Masuda detours in the ODE caricature. We conclude with some comments on global aspects, PDEs, discretizations, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Four collapsing one-dimensional particles: a dynamical system approach of the spherical billiard reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of four one-dimensional inelastic hard spheres evolving on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and colliding according to a scattering law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient $r$. We study the possible orders of collisions when the inelastic collapse occurs, relying on the so-called $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping, a two-dimensional dynamical system associated to the original particle system which encodes all the possible collision orders. We prove that the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping is a piecewise projective transformation, which allows one to perform efficient numerical simulations of its orbits. We recover previously known results concerning the one-dimensional four-particle inelastic hard sphere system and we support the conjectures stated in the literature concerning particular periodic orbits. We discover three new families of periodic orbits that coexist depending on the restitution coefficient, we prove rigorously that there exist stable periodic orbits for the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping for restitution coefficients larger than the upper bounds previously known, and we prove the existence of quasi-periodic orbits for this mapping.</description>

This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP).

Abstract: We provide a complete characterisation of automaticity of uniformly recurrent substitutive sequences in terms of the incidence matrix of the return substitution of the underlying purely substitutive sequence. This resolves a recent question posed by Allouche, Dekking and Queff\'elec in the uniformly recurrent case. We show that the same criterion characterizes automaticity of minimal substitutive systems.
  Furthermore, we construct a minimal substitutive system whose maximal equicontinuous factor is the 2-adic odometer, and for which the corresponding factor map is everywhere uncountable-to-one. We conjecture that a minimal substitutive system is k-automatic if and only if it is an everywhere finite-to-one extension of a k-adic odometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure: for instance Pascal's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle. It has been shown that such patterns can occur when the alphabet is endowed with the structure of an Abelian group, provided the cellular automaton is a morphism with respect to this structure and the initial configuration has finite support. The spacetime diagram then has a property related to k-automaticity. We show that these conditions can be relaxed: the Abelian group can be a commutative monoid, the initial configuration can be k-automatic, and the spacetime diagrams still exhibit the same regularity.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we construct examples of bounded smooth convex domains with no non-trivial analytic discs on the boundary which possess a holomorphic self-map without fixed points so that the iterates do not converge to a point (that is, the Denjoy-Wolff theorem does not hold). We also show that, in the case of bounded convex domains with $C^{1+\varepsilon}$-smooth boundary which have non-trivial analytic discs on the boundary, the cluster set of the orbits of holomorphic self-maps without fixed points can be equal to the principal part of any prime end of any planar bounded simply connected domain.</description>

Abstract: Let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact subset equipped with a $\delta$-Ahlfors regular measure $\mu$. For any $\tau&gt;1/d$ and any ``inhomogeneous'' vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}\in\mathbb R^d$, let $W_d(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$ denote the set of $(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$-well approximable numbers, where $\psi_\tau(q)=q^{-\tau}$. Assuming a local estimate for the $\mu$-measure of the intersections of $K$ with the neighborhoods of ``rational'' vectors $(\mathbf p+\boldsymbol{\theta})/q$, we establish a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $K\cap W_d(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$, together with some nontrivial lower bounds when $\tau$ is below a certain threshold. One of the lower bounds becomes sharp in the one-dimensional homogeneous case ($d=1$, $\theta=0$) for a class of sufficiently thick self-similar sets $K$, and moreover $K\cap W_1(\psi_\tau,0)$ has full $(\delta+\frac{2}{1+\tau}-1)$-Hausdorff measure. These results have several applications:
  (1) the set of homogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within strongly irreducible self-similar sets in $\mathbb R^d$, extending a recent result of Chen [arXiv:2510.17096];
  (2) the set of inhomogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within sufficiently thick missing digits sets in $\mathbb R$, affirmatively answering a question posed by Yu [arXiv:2101.05910].
  Our applications build on the seminal works of Yu [arXiv:2101.05910] and B\'enard, He and Zhang [arXiv:2508.09076].
  We also provide some non-trivial missing digits set $K\subset[0,1]^d$ whose intersection with $W_d(\psi_\tau,0)$ has full $(\delta+\frac{1+d}{1+\tau}-d)$-Hausdorff measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators on quantum graphs where the number of edges between points is determined by orbits of a "shift of finite type". We prove Anderson localization for these systems.</description>
