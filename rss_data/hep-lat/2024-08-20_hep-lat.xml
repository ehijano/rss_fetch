      <title>Scattering of dark pions in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>

Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Large $N_c$ QCD phase diagram at $\mu_B = 0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies suggest that at zero baryon chemical potential and increasing temperature there are three characteristic regimes in QCD that are connected by smooth analytical crossovers: a hadron gas regime at T &lt; T_ch ~ 155 MeV, an intermediate regime, called stringy fluid, at T_ch &lt; T &lt; ~ 3 T_ch, and a quark-gluon plasma regime at higher temperatures. These regimes have been interpreted to reflect different approximate symmetries and effective degrees of freedom. In the hadron gas the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is spontaneously broken. The intermediate regime has been interpreted as lacking spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking along with the emergence of new approximate symmetry, chiral spin symmetry, that is not a symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian, but is a symmetry of the confining part of the QCD Lagrangian. While the high temperature regime is the usual quark-gluon plasma which is often considered to reflect "deconfinement" in some way. This paper explores the behavior of these regimes of QCD as the number of colors in the theory, N_c, gets large. In the large N_c limit the theory is center-symmetric and notions of confinement and deconfinement are unambiguous. The energy density is O(N_c^0) in the meson gas, O(N_c^1) in the intermediate regime and O(N_c^2) in the quark-gluon plasma regime. In the large N_c limit these regimes may become distinct phases separated by first order phase transitions. The intermediate phase has the peculiar feature that glueballs should exist and have properties that are unchanged from what is seen in the vacuum (up to 1/N_c corrections), while the ordinary dilute gas of mesons with broken chiral symmetry disappears and approximate chiral spin symmetry should emerge.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Charged $T_{cc}^{++}$ States in the Dynamical Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the celebrated tools in explaining the Hydrogen atom is Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The resemblance of $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ tetraquarks to Hydrogen atom within Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) implies usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation for these multiquark states. In this work, we use dynamical diquark model to calculate mass spectra and sizes of doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states denoted as $T_{cc}^{++}$. Our results for mass spectra indicate some bound state candidates with respect to corresponding two-meson thresholds. Calculation of expectation values of $\sqrt{\langle r^2 \rangle}$ reflects that doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states are compact.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>
