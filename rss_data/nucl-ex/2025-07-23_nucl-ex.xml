      <title>Quantum Scaling in Energy Correlators Beyond the Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD scaling behavior of the small-angle Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC), focusing on the transition between its perturbative pre-confinement and non-perturbative post-confinement regimes. Applying the light-ray Operator Product Expansion (OPE), we develop a formalism that describes the scaling of the EEC with the input energy $Q$ in the transition and the post-confinement region, where the latter quantum scaling is determined by the $J=5$ DGLAP anomalous dimension. A key result of our work is a novel connection between the light-ray OPE and the dihadron fragmentation function (DFF), where we show that the non-perturbative OPE coefficients correspond to moments of the DFF. This finding establishes a new paradigm for studying hadronization. Our theoretical predictions are validated against Monte Carlo simulations for both $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, showing excellent agreement. The potential role of the quantum scaling in the precision determination of $\alpha_s$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

      <title>The Automatic Calibration Method of the Compton Edge Based on Normalized Cross-correlation and Simulated Annealing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate energy channel calibration in scintillation detectors is essential for reliable radiation detection across nuclear physics, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring. Organic scintillators like BC408 and EJ309 lack full-energy peaks, making their Compton edge a critical calibration alternative where traditional peak methods fail. Existing Compton edge identification techniques - Gaussian fitting for the 50%-70% amplitude point, first derivative minimum detection, and Monte Carlo simulation - suffer significant degradation from low count rates, spectral overlap, and subjective interval selection. For the first time, we propose an automated calibration procedure based on Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and a convolutional response model to address these issues. This method automates the selection of the Compton edge interval through NCC-based matching, utilizes SA for global parameter optimization, and then employs a convolutional model for precise matching. Experiments involving the irradiation of organic scintillators (BC408, EJ309) and inorganic scintillators (NaI:Tl, LaBr3:Ce) with 137Cs, 22Na, 54Mn, and 60Co radiation sources demonstrate that this method achieves accuracy commensurate with full-energy peak calibration method (cosine similarity &gt;99.999%) and exhibits superior stability compared to the two traditional methods. In the extreme cases of spectral overlap and low count rate, the average errors of this method are 19.77% and 15.65% of those from the two traditional methods in BC408, 56.44% and 33.15% of those from the two traditional methods in EJ309. This work advances detector calibration and offers a scalable, automated solution for high-energy experiments and portable devices.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $n \bar{D}_{s0}^*(2317)$ interaction and the issue of elastic unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a neutron with the $\bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance and look at the amplitude below threshold and close above threshold. The study is done from the perspective that the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of $DK$. To study this interaction, we use the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations that considers the $DK$ molecule as the cluster and the neutron as the external particle. We improve the Fixed Center approach to implement elastic unitarity around threshold, which is needed to obtain scattering parameters and to evaluate the $n \bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ correlation function that we determine here. One interesting result of the study is the appearance of a resonant state below threshold with a binding of about 130 MeV and a width of about 80 MeV, which we suggest to look at in reactions measuring the invariant mass of $\pi \Sigma \bar D$. The ALICE collaboration has initiated studies of this type, by looking at the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function, and we can only encourage work in this direction which should provide much valuable information on the nature of many resonant states.</description>

      <title>Alpha clustering in warm and dense nuclear matter from heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although light nuclear clusters are known to affect the properties of warm and dilute nuclear matter, their role in warm and dense nuclear matter remains unclear due to the lack of experimental evidence for their modifications by the Mott effect in such an environment. To address this issue, we resort to intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, where light clusters are mainly produced in the transiently formed warm and dense matter. A kinetic approach, which includes dynamically the formation and dissociation of light clusters, is employed to deduce the strength of the Mott effects and the $\alpha$-particle fraction in warm and dense nuclear matter from the light-nuclei yields measured by the FOPI Collaboration in central Au$+$Au collisions at energies of $0.25A$ to $0.6A~\rm GeV$. We find an unexpectedly abundant $\alpha$ clustering in this environment, which will have profound implications for modeling the nuclear equation of state and describing supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Violation of NCQ scaling in hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-7.7GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow for various hadrons in non-central Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0\text{--}7.7\,\mathrm{GeV}\) using the AMPT model with string melting (SM) and pure hadron cascade (HC) modes. For the SM case, NCQ scaling is absent at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\) but is largely restored by \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.9\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Although quark coalescence occurs at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the lack of NCQ scaling is attributed to the insufficient development of quark elliptic flow and the limited production of strange quarks and antiquarks. This finding suggests that NCQ scaling could not be considered a definitive signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in the RHIC fixed-target energy region. For the HC case, as expected, no NCQ scaling is observed. However, a mass ordering in the elliptic flow emerges at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =4.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), indicating that full thermalization may not be a prerequisite for mass ordering.</description>
