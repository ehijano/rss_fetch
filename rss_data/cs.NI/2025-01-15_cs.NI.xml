      <title>Continual Reinforcement Learning for Digital Twin Synchronization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the adaptive resource allocation scheme for digital twin (DT) synchronization optimization over dynamic wireless networks. In our considered model, a base station (BS) continuously collects factory physical object state data from wireless devices to build a real-time virtual DT system for factory event analysis. Due to continuous data transmission, maintaining DT synchronization must use extensive wireless resources. To address this issue, a subset of devices is selected to transmit their sensing data, and resource block (RB) allocation is optimized. This problem is formulated as a constrained Markov process (CMDP) problem that minimizes the long-term mismatch between the physical and virtual systems. To solve this CMDP, we first transform the problem into a dual problem that refines RB constraint impacts on device scheduling strategies. We then propose a continual reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm to solve the dual problem. The CRL algorithm learns a stable policy across historical experiences for quick adaptation to dynamics in physical states and network capacity. Simulation results show that the CRL can adapt quickly to network capacity changes and reduce normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between physical and virtual states by up to 55.2%, using the same RB number as traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Smooth Handovers via Smoothed Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With users demanding seamless connectivity, handovers (HOs) have become a fundamental element of cellular networks. However, optimizing HOs is a challenging problem, further exacerbated by the growing complexity of mobile networks. This paper presents the first countrywide study of HO optimization, through the prism of Smoothed Online Learning (SOL). We first analyze an extensive dataset from a commercial mobile network operator (MNO) in Europe with more than 40M users, to understand and reveal important features and performance impacts on HOs. Our findings highlight a correlation between HO failures/delays, and the characteristics of radio cells and end-user devices, showcasing the impact of heterogeneity in mobile networks nowadays. We subsequently model UE-cell associations as dynamic decisions and propose a realistic system model for smooth and accurate HOs that extends existing approaches by (i) incorporating device and cell features on HO optimization, and (ii) eliminating (prior) strong assumptions about requiring future signal measurements and knowledge of end-user mobility. Our algorithm, aligned with the O-RAN paradigm, provides robust dynamic regret guarantees, even in challenging environments, and shows superior performance in multiple scenarios with real-world and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Toward Interactive Multi-User Extended Reality Using Millimeter-Wave Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) enables a plethora of novel interactive shared experiences. Ideally, users are allowed to roam around freely, while audiovisual content is delivered wirelessly to their Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Therefore, truly immersive experiences will require massive amounts of data, in the range of tens of gigabits per second, to be delivered reliably at extremely low latencies. We identify Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communications, at frequencies between 24 and 300 GHz, as a key enabler for such experiences. In this article, we show how the mmWave state of the art does not yet achieve sufficient performance, and identify several key active research directions expected to eventually pave the way for extremely-high-quality mmWave-enabled interactive multi-user XR.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Train Transportation in Sri Lanka: A Smart IOT based Multi-Subsystem Approach using MQTT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a system as a solution for the challenges faced by Sri Lanka' s historic railway system, such as scheduling delays, overcrowding, manual ticketing, and management inefficiencies. It proposes a multi-subsystem approach, incorporating GPS tracking, RFID-based e-ticketing, seat reservation, and vision-based people counting. The GPS based real time train tracking system performs accurately within 24 meters, with the MQTT protocol showing twice the speed of the HTTP-based system. All subsystems use the MQTT protocol to enhance efficiency, reliability, and passenger experience. The study's data and methodology demonstrate the effectiveness of these innovations in improving scheduling, passenger flow, and overall system performance, offering promising solutions for modernizing Sri Lanka's railway infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Smells-sus: Sustainability Smells in IaC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practitioners use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts to efficiently configure IT infrastructures through machine-readable definition files. However, during the development of these scripts, some code patterns or deployment choices may lead to sustainability issues like inefficient resource utilization or redundant provisioning for example. We call this type of patterns sustainability smells. These inefficiencies pose significant environmental and financial challenges, given the growing scale of cloud computing. This research focuses on Terraform, a widely adopted IaC tool. Our study involves defining seven sustainability smells and validating them through a survey with 19 IaC practitioners. We utilized a dataset of 28,327 Terraform scripts from 395 open-source repositories. We performed a detailed qualitative analysis of a randomly sampled 1,860 Terraform scripts from the original dataset to identify code patterns that correspond to the sustainability smells and used the other 26,467 Terraform scripts to study the prevalence of the defined sustainability smells. Our results indicate varying prevalence rates of these smells across the dataset. The most prevalent smell is Monolithic Infrastructure, which appears in 9.67\% of the scripts. Additionally, our findings highlight the complexity of conducting root cause analysis for sustainability issues, as these smells often arise from a confluence of script structures, configuration choices, and deployment contexts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced SPS Velocity-adaptive Scheme: Access Fariness in 5G NR V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology enables information exchange between vehicles and road infrastructure. Specifically, when a vehicle approaches a roadside unit (RSU), it can exchange information with the RSU to obtain accurate data that assists in driving. With the release of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16, which includes the 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standards, vehicles typically adopt mode-2 communication using sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for resource allocation. In this approach, vehicles identify candidate resources within a selection window and exclude ineligible resources based on information from a sensing window. However, vehicles often drive at different speeds, resulting in varying amounts of data transmission with RSUs as they pass by, which leads to unfair access. Therefore, it is essential to design an access scheme that accounts for different vehicle speeds to achieve fair access across the network. This paper formulates an optimization problem for vehicular networks and proposes a multi-objective optimization scheme to address it by adjusting the selection window in the SPS mechanism of 5G NR V2I mode-2. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme</description>

      <title>Mobility Management in Integrated Sensing and Communications Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks is considerably affected by the mobility of the transceiver nodes, user equipment devices (UEs) and the passive objects that are sensed. For instance, the sensing efficiency is considerably affected by the presence or absence of a line-of-sight connection between the sensing transceivers and the object; a condition that may change quickly due to mobility. Moreover, the mobility of the UEs and objects may result in dynamically varying communication-to-sensing and sensing-to communication interference, deteriorating the network performance. In such cases, there may be a need to handover the sensing process to neighbor nodes. In this article, we develop the concept of mobility management in ISAC networks. Here, depending on the mobility of objects and/or the transceiver nodes, the data traffic, the sensing or communication coverage area of the transceivers, and the network interference, the transmission and/or the reception of the sensing signals may be handed over to neighbor nodes. Also, the ISAC configuration and modality - that is, using monostatic or bistatic sensing - are updated accordingly, such that the sensed objects can be continuously sensed with low overhead. We show that mobility management reduces the sensing interruption and boosts the communication and sensing efficiency of ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>CoVRage: Millimeter-Wave Beamforming for Mobile Interactive Virtual Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) setups often include an external source delivering content to a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). "Cutting the wire" in such setups and going truly wireless will require a wireless network capable of delivering enormous amounts of video data at an extremely low latency. The massive bandwidth of higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, can meet these requirements. Due to high attenuation and path loss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming is essential. In wireless VR, where the antenna is integrated into the HMD, any head rotation also changes the antenna's orientation. As such, beamforming must adapt, in real-time, to the user's head rotations. An HMD's built-in sensors providing accurate orientation estimates may facilitate such rapid beamforming. In this work, we present coVRage, a receive-side beamforming solution tailored for VR HMDs. Using built-in orientation prediction present on modern HMDs, the algorithm estimates how the Angle of Arrival (AoA) at the HMD will change in the near future, and covers this AoA trajectory with a dynamically shaped oblong beam, synthesized using sub-arrays. We show that this solution can cover these trajectories with consistently high gain, even in light of temporally or spatially inaccurate orientational data.</description>

      <title>Chronicles of jockeying in queuing systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trends in communication systems suggest gradual adjustments in the infrastructural landscape and application ecosystem. The dynamics arising from these changes, plus the expected service level requirements, present more challenges with regard to packet transmission, task offloading and impatient queueing. Generally, there are two types of common impatient queuing behavior that have been well studied, namely balking and reneging. In this survey, we are interested in the third type of impatience: jockeying, a phenomenon that draws origins from impatient customers switching from one queue to another. The problem is that there exists a plethora of literature that theoretically models for such impatience and all studies are diverse in the methodologies used. This raises questions about the practicality of some concepts from impatient queueing in dynamic environments. This survey chronicles those findings whose use case coverage includes information and communication systems, especially Multi-Access Edge Computing. We comparatively summarize the reviewed literature regarding the methodologies, invoked models and use cases. Furthermore, we discuss recently emerging paradigms and opens issues that are worth deeper study. This discussion is guided by the argument that the expected architectural transformations in these systems bring into question the applicability of existing impatience modeling schemes.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Attacks on Federated Learning-based Wireless Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a distributed framework to train a global control model across multiple base stations without compromising the privacy of their local network data. This makes it ideal for applications like wireless traffic prediction (WTP), which plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enabling proactive traffic flow management, and enhancing the reliability of downstream communication-aided applications, such as IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation systems. Despite its promise, the security aspects of FL-based distributed wireless systems, particularly in regression-based WTP problems, remain inadequately investigated. In this paper, we introduce a novel fake traffic injection (FTI) attack, designed to undermine the FL-based WTP system by injecting fabricated traffic distributions with minimal knowledge. We further propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), which strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a specific percentile range estimated through statistical methods in each dimension. Extensive experimental evaluations, performed on real-world wireless traffic datasets, demonstrate that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Snake Learning: A Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Learning Framework for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolution towards 6G, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with advanced network infrastructure emerges as a pivotal strategy for enhancing network intelligence and resource utilization. Existing distributed learning frameworks like Federated Learning and Split Learning often struggle with significant challenges in dynamic network environments including high synchronization demands, costly communication overhead, severe computing resource consumption, and data heterogeneity across network nodes. These obstacles hinder the applications of ubiquitous computing capabilities of 6G networks, especially in light of the trend of escalating model parameters and training data volumes. To address these challenges effectively, this paper introduces ``Snake Learning", a cost-effective distributed learning framework. Specifically, Snake Learning respects the heterogeneity of inter-node computing capability and local data distribution in 6G networks, and sequentially trains the designated part of model layers on individual nodes. This layer-by-layer serpentine update mechanism contributes to significantly reducing the requirements for storage, memory and communication during the model training phase, and demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency for both classification and fine-tuning tasks across homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gigabit Interactive Extended Reality over Millimeter-Wave: An End-to-End System Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-quality wireless interactive Extended Reality (XR) will require multi-gigabit throughput at extremely low latency. The Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequency bands, between 24 and 300GHz, can achieve such extreme performance. However, maintaining a consistently high Quality of Experience with highly mobile users is challenging, as mmWave communications are inherently directional. In this work, we present and evaluate an end-to-end approach to such a mmWave-based mobile XR system. We perform a highly realistic simulation of the system, incorporating accurate XR data traffic, detailed mmWave propagation models and actual user motion. We evaluate the impact of the beamforming strategy and frequency on the overall performance. In addition, we provide the first system-level evaluation of the CoVRage algorithm, a proactive and spatially aware user-side beamforming approach designed specifically for highly mobile XR environments.</description>

      <title>Securing Distributed Network Digital Twin Systems Against Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of 5G and beyond, the increasing complexity of wireless networks necessitates innovative frameworks for efficient management and deployment. Digital twins (DTs), embodying real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, stand out as a promising solution in this context. Within a time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital counterparts, encapsulated by integrated vertical and horizontal twinning phases, this study investigates the security challenges in distributed network DT systems, which potentially undermine the reliability of subsequent network applications such as wireless traffic forecasting. Specifically, we consider a minimal-knowledge scenario for all attackers, in that they do not have access to network data and other specialized knowledge, yet can interact with previous iterations of server-level models. In this context, we spotlight a novel fake traffic injection attack designed to compromise a distributed network DT system for wireless traffic prediction. In response, we then propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), to counteract various model poisoning threats. GLID strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a particular percentile range, thereby fortifying the security of network twinning process. Through extensive experiments on real-world wireless traffic datasets, our experimental evaluations show that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines, highlighting the importance of security measures in the design and implementation of DTs for 5G and beyond network systems.</description>

Abstract: Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.</description>

      <title>Biologically-Inspired Technologies: Integrating Brain-Computer Interface and Neuromorphic Computing for Human Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23639</link>

Abstract: The integration of immersive communication into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the demand for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) driven by multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.</description>
