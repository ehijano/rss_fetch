      <title>WISPedia -- the WISPs Encyclopedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weakly-Interacting Slim Particle encyclopedia (WISPedia) is a comprehensive reference work dedicated to the systematic compilation of theoretical models, Effective Field Theories, and frameworks involving Weakly Interacting Slim Particles (WISPs): a broad class of light, feebly coupled particles proposed in extensions of the Standard Model. In current times, where the number of models largely surpasses the number of new physics signals, this encyclopedia aims to provide a concise reference of their landscape. The goal is to provide a useful tool to the community to navigate among them. It does not aim to review all the models in detail, but to define their essential characteristics, and point the reader to useful and minimal material such as the original sources, review articles, tools and general compilations of bounds. Hence, the format of this reference resembles the direct style of a model encyclopedia of WISPs.</description>

      <title>Tuning the violins: dark sector phase transition models for the PTA signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in a dark sector have been invoked as an intriguing possibility to explain the observed stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Here we perform a comprehensive study of the generic requirements for such a phase transition to explain the observed signal while being consistent with all relevant constraints. We consider three broad model classes for strong first-order transitions, realised by an Abelian dark Higgs boson, a two-step phase transition involving two scalar singlets, and a conformal scalar field with loop-induced symmetry breaking, respectively. We discuss the tuning that is required to successfully explain the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) signal in each of these cases, and highlight the underlying physical mechanisms. We conclude that all three scenarios can in principle describe the data, but that conformal models stand out as the most generic, and least tuned, explanation. Future observations by the PTA collaborations and collider experiments will be crucial to test the viability of this hypothesis, and to further narrow in on the model parameters, if the PTA signal is indeed due to a strong first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Left-Right signals at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an extensive discussion of the displaced signals of heavy Majorana neutrino production at future electron-positron colliders operating at various proposed energies in the context of the Left-Right symmetric model. A comprehensive collection of channels is taken into account, ranging from those featuring $W$ and $W_R$ mediation to those induced by scalar mixing and gauge/scalar boson fusion, with connections to the mechanism of neutrino mass origin. The emerging signatures feature possibly multiple displaced heavy neutrinos that are in some cases accompanied by prompt activity and forward leptons. We derive the corresponding total production rates and differential distributions, which allow us to differentiate the channels and have analytical estimates of the signal yield. We then develop realistic estimates of the selection efficiencies using a dedicated vertexing algorithm which establishes the displaced decay positions and supplies a reliable proxy for reconstructing the full four-momenta of long-lived particles. This allows to determine the realistic reaches in the parameter space of the Left-Right symmetric model across the various channels, and we show that these can strongly surpass the LHC ones, demonstrating that future lepton colliders are sensitive to left-right symmetry breaking scales in the deep multi-TeV regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental Tests of Baryon and Lepton Number Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon number ($B$) conservation underlies the apparent stability of ordinary matter by forbidding the decay of nucleons, while lepton number ($L$) conservation plays a central role in the structure of lepton interactions and the possible origin of neutrino mass. In the Standard Model, $B$ and $L$ are accidental global symmetries rather than imposed fundamental principles. However, they are expected to be violated in many extensions of the theory, including frameworks of unification and processes in the early Universe. This review summarizes the status of experimental tests of $B$ and $L$ conservation and discusses them within a unified framework for interpreting current and future searches across different processes and experimental approaches, outlining historical and theoretical motivation, key physical processes, as well as their broader connections and complementarity to other searches.</description>

      <title>A multi-event interface for next-to-leading order calculations in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the implementation of a multi-event interface for next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, allowing tree-level scattering amplitudes for multiple phase space points to be evaluated in each call to the integrated NLO differential cross section during event generation. Additionally, a multithreaded implementation based on this multi-event interface where tree-level amplitudes are evaluated in parallel across multiple CPU threads is presented for the Monte Carlo generation of quantum chromodynamical (QCD) events. Although this work primarily concerns the implemented code, some algorithmic changes involving the order of the application of phase-space cuts and calls to different scattering amplitudes are included. The codebase currently supports multi-threaded execution, but these changes pave the way for continued data parallelism in the form of on-CPU SIMD instructions or SIMT GPU offloading. A study in the runtime fraction spent in different diagrammatic contributions across various processes suggests that NLO QCD event generation are computationally dominated by tree-level scattering amplitude evaluations, which we show are perfectly suited for data parallelisation.</description>

      <title>Study of the $J/\psi \to \Lambda\bar{\Sigma}^0\eta$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isospin violating $J/\psi \to \Lambda\bar \Sigma^0 \eta $ reaction, recently measured by the BESIII collaboration, by looking at the dominant terms with $\bar \Sigma^0$ and a pair of pseudoscalar-baryon particles that form together an SU(3) singlet and can thus couple to the $J/\psi $. Next we allow these pairs to undergo final state interaction to produce the final $\eta \Lambda$. We find that the relevant original channels are $\bar K N$ and $K \Xi$, and the non cancelation of terms involving charged and neutral particles, because of their different masses, is responsible for the reaction. With that mechanism we find a good agreement with the three experimental mass distributions.</description>

      <title>pMSSM versus complete models and the excellent prospects for top-squark discovery at HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHC sparticle search limits are usually performed within the context of simplified models and subsequently interpreted within the 19 parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) as to how many models avoid search limits for a particular sparticle mass, often including WIMP dark matter constraints. We provide a critical discussion of this procedure and how it can go wrong due to the introduction of new prejudices. By ameliorating these conditions, one is pushed into the more plausible four extra parameter non-universal Higgs model (NUHM4). Implementing a decoupling/quasi-degeneracy solution to the SUSY flavor and CP problems leads to first/second generation sfermions in the tens-of-TeV range. In this case, the natural solutions typically contain top-squarks in the 1-2 TeV range which are accessible to high-lumi LHC (HL-LHC) searches. This search channel, along with higgsino and wino pair production, may allow a nearly complete scan of natural/plausible parameter space by HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Constructing Dimension-8 SMEFT from Conserved Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Field Theories (EFTs) are the primary tool for interpreting precision collider data in the absence of new resonances. However, in the dimension-8 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the utility of traditional algebraically minimal bases is fundamentally limited by kinematic mixing: multiple operators contribute to a single high-energy amplitude, creating degeneracies that obscure ultraviolet interpretations and complicate the application of theoretical constraints. We introduce a generative framework that resolves this by constructing operators directly from the conserved Noether currents of the Standard Model. The resulting Kinematically Diagonalized Current Basis (KDCB) ensures that each operator maps to a unique asymptotic energy scaling ($E^4$, $E^2$, $E^0$) in scattering amplitudes. This organization makes S-matrix positivity bounds manifest, enables a stable auxiliary-field formulation for Monte Carlo simulation, and provides direct diagnostics for universal versus non-universal ultraviolet completions through current decomposition. By rotating the operator space into physically interpretable sectors, the KDCB offers a transformative framework for global fits and a clear pathway from high-energy data to the structure of new physics.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi Identity in Denominator Regularization at One Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit analytic expressions for the electron self-energy and the vertex correction in quantum electrodynamics are derived at one loop using the recently proposed regularization scheme known as denominator regularization, assisted by its correspondence with dimensional regularization to determine the coefficient functions, which are a specific ingredient of this approach. We then show that the regularized amplitudes satisfy the Ward-Takahashi identity, thereby ensuring that gauge symmetry is preserved after regularization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression for $\Omega\Omega$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement suppression in $s$-wave $\Omega\Omega$ scattering, where each baryon has spin $3/2$. By treating the $S$-matrix as a quantum operator acting on the spin states, we quantify its ability to generate entanglement and identify the conditions on the phase shifts of the spin channels that minimize entanglement generation in the system. In $\Omega\Omega$ scattering, only antisymmetric spin channels are allowed due to Fermi-Dirac statistics. Applying the entanglement-suppression framework to $\Omega\Omega$ scattering, we find two solutions for the phase shifts: one leading to a spin SU(4) symmetry and the other to a nonrelativistic conformal symmetry. We show that the solution associated with the nonrelativistic conformal symmetry originates from the specific structure of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in the $3/2 \otimes 3/2$ system.</description>

      <title>Constraints on invisible $B^{+}\to K^{+} X$ decays from the Belle II $B^{+} \to K^{+} \nu \bar{\nu}$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belle II measurement of the branching fraction for $B^{+} \to K^{+} \nu \bar{\nu}$ shows a $2.7\sigma$ excess over the Standard Model prediction and motivates new-physics explanations such as axion-like particles, Higgs-like scalars, or beyond Standard Model gauge bosons. A two-body decay \BKX with an invisible $X$ provides a natural candidate explanation. This work provides a comprehensive test of this hypothesis using Belle II's public model-agnostic likelihood. Posterior distributions are derived for the resonance mass $m_X$ and the branching fraction, and a modified frequentist upper-limit mass scan is performed. The data favor a resonance with mass $m_X = 2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ GeV and the product $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+ X) \cdot \mathcal{P}_{X,\rm inv} = 9.2^{+1.8}_{-3.4} \cdot 10^{-6}$, where $\mathcal{P}_{X,\rm inv}$ is the probability that $X$ (and its decay products) are undetected. Bayes factors indicate a very strong preference for the Standard Model plus resonance over the Standard Model-only hypothesis. A frequentist likelihood-ratio test favors the Standard Model plus resonance hypothesis by $3.0\sigma$. A light invisible resonance plus the Standard Model therefore provides a compelling description of the Belle II data.</description>

      <title>The S-wave topped meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent observation of the near-threshold enhancement in top-quark pair production by CMS and ATLAS, we investigate the mass spectrum of S-wave topped meson which containing a single top quark, i.e., $t\bar{q}$, $t\bar{c}$, and $t\bar{b}$, in the framework of Bethe-Salpeter formalism. These states are expected to exhibit significantly enhanced lifetimes and correspondingly narrower decay widths compared to toponium, primarily because only a single top quark participates in the weak decay process. The numerical results indicate that the masses of topped mesons are close to the top-quark mass. For the $t\bar{b}$ states, the $1S$ state is approximately 5.08~GeV heavier than the top quark, while the $2S$, $3S$, and $4S$ states are about 5.37~GeV, 5.57~GeV, and 5.74~GeV heavier, respectively. For the $t\bar{c}$ states, the corresponding mass differences are 1.90~GeV, 2.23~GeV, 2.45~GeV, and 2.60~GeV. The possible production and decay properties are also analyzed, which could be measured in LHC experiments.</description>

      <title>$S-P-D$ Mixing in Vector Quarkonia from the Salpeter Equation with Optimized Wave Function Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel mechanism based on the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter (Salpeter) equation for investigating wave function mixing in vector mesons such as $\psi(3770)$. Conventional theories typically treat $\psi(3770)$ as a $2S-1D$ mixed state; however, considering only tensor forces or relativistic corrections alone often leads to mixing angles that are too small and inconsistent with experimental data. Phenomenological $2S-1D$ mixing requires experimental data as input to determine the mixing angles, resulting in limited theoretical studies on states like $\Upsilon(1D, 2D)$ in the absence of experimental data. To more accurately describe $S-D$ mixing and its relativistic effects, this paper systematically compares eight possible relativistic wave function representations ($\varphi_1$ to $\varphi_8$) by solving the Salpeter equation and calculates the mass spectra and dileptonic decay widths of charmonium and bottomonium. The study finds that the wave function representation $\varphi_2$ can simultaneously reproduce the experimental data of both charmonium and bottomonium well. Further analysis reveals that, in addition to $S-D$ mixing, the wave functions of vector mesons contain a non-negligible $P$-wave component, meaning they are $S-P-D$ mixed states. We predict the mixing angles for bottomonium $\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\Upsilon(2D)$ to be $(1.78^{+0.32}_{-0.25})^\circ$ and $(5.44^{+1.10}_{-0.76})^\circ$, with dileptonic decay widths of $2.29^{+0.86}_{-0.69}$ eV and $10.5^{+4.2}_{-3.1}$ eV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Multiple Polylogarithms with Arbitrary Arguments in \textsc{GiNaC}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms for arbitrary arguments and to arbitrary precision. The cornerstone of our approach is a procedure to obtain a convergent $q$-series representation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms. Its coefficients are expressed in terms of ordinary multiple polylogarithms, which can be evaluated efficiently using existing libraries. In a series of preparation steps the elliptic polylogarithms are mapped into a region where the $q$-series converges rapidly. We also present an implementation of our algorithm into the \texttt{GiNaC} framework. This release constitutes the first public package capable of evaluating elliptic multiple polylogarithms to high precision and for arbitrary values of the arguments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological signature and light Dark Matter in Dirac $L_\mu-L_\tau$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an anomaly-free extension of the Standard Model (SM) $viz.$ gauged ${L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model in the Dirac framework, where the local $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry breaks and gives rise to a new gauge boson $Z'$ and corresponding gauge coupling $g_{\mu\tau}$. Three additional heavy vector-like fermions, three light right-handed neutrinos and two heavy singlet scalars are added to complete the model framework for Dirac neutrinos. Another singlet vector-like fermion is added with a new gauge charge, which serves as a viable DM candidate, and the correct relic abundance is obtained via the resonance effect. The parameter space is considered after satisfying the current bounds on $M_{Z'}$ and the gauge coupling $g_{\mu\tau}$. The influence of dark radiations coming from the additional light degrees of freedoms are studied in connection with the dark matter. After imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, the allowed parameter space is found to be highly restricted yet still accessible to ongoing and near-future experiments, rendering the scenario strongly predictive. Moreover, clear correlations among the relevant observables emerge throughout this study, making the model testable in current and future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>The Too Visible QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Murayama proposed a GeV-scale axion theory where the up-quark mass term is generated dynamically by the QCD chiral condensate, spontaneously breaking a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. It predicts a too large mass splitting between neutral and charged pions. Trying to solve this problem we explore extensions. Despite some partial improvements, we identify a structural obstruction: the new Peccei-Quinn spurion breaks the accidental isospin symmetry of the chiral Lagrangian, leading to an enhanced higher-order operator. As a consequence, pion scatterings too are distorted. We also examine the limit in which the axion becomes light, finding that it is excluded by fifth-force constraints.</description>

Abstract: The energy levels of the ground states of the three-particle and four-particle bound states of leptons in quantum electrodynamics are calculated. For the calculation, the variational method with Gaussian basis functions is used.

      <title>Tensor states $\Upsilon B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor states $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}}=\Upsilon B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{c}}=J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are explored using techniques of QCD sum rule method. These hadronic molecules, composed of only heavy quarks, have asymmetric quark contents $bb\overline{b} \overline{c}$ and $cc\overline{c}\overline{b}$, respectively. The masses $ m=(15864 \pm 85)~\mathrm{MeV} $ and $\widetilde{m}=(9870 \pm 82)~\mathrm{MeV} $ prove that these structures are unstable against dissociations to constituent mesons. Full widths of molecules $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{b}}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{c}}$ are calculated by considering their dominant and subleading decay channels. The subleading channels are processes generated by annihilations of $\overline{b}b$ and $ \overline{c}c$ quarks. For the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b} }$ dominant decays are $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}} \to \Upsilon B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}} \to \eta_b B_{c}^{-}$, whereas subleading channels are transformations to $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}}\rightarrow B^{(\ast )-}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$ and $\overline{B}_{(s)}^{(\ast )0}D_{(s)}^{(\ast )-}$ mesons. In the case of $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{c}}$ we explore decays to $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$, $\eta_{c}B_{c}^{+}$, $B^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )0}$ and $ B_{(s)}^{(\ast )0}D_{(s)}^{(\ast )+}$ mesons. Predictions $\Gamma[\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}}]=120^{+17}_{-12}~ \mathrm{MeV} $ and $\Gamma[ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{c}}]=(71 \pm 9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ for the widths of these molecules characterize them as relatively broad structures.</description>

      <title>Minimal Freeze-in Dark Matter: Reviving electroweak doublet dark matter with Boltzmann suppressed freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter communicating with the Standard Model solely via electroweak interactions provides a compelling picture. However, thermal freeze-out of electroweak doublet dark matter is generically strongly excluded by direct detection. We show that SU(2)${}_L$ doublet fermion dark matter evades direct detection if its mass exceeds $10^{10}$ GeV. If the neutral Dirac fermion is split into a pseudo-Dirac pair (via high dimension operator) this limit can be relaxed to 300 GeV. Provided the dark matter mass is above the reheat temperature of the Universe, the production rate never exceeds the Hubble rate in cases of interest, thus the dark matter never thermalizes. We apply constraints from direct detection (e.g. LZ) and consider the discovery potential of Darwin. This scenario presents the most minimal model of freeze-in dark matter, and is both elegant and highly predictive.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Abundance from Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive robust constraints on the initial abundance of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) using the reionization history of the Universe as a cosmological probe. We focus on PBHs that inject electromagnetic (EM) energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM) after recombination, in the mass range $3.2\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$. For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply score-based diffusion models to two-dimensional SU(2) lattice pure gauge theory with the Wilson action, extending recent work on U(1) gauge theories. The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $\beta_0= 2.0$ on an $8\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $\beta$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|\Delta| \leq 0.001$ for $\beta \in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|\Delta| &lt; 0.06$ across $\beta \in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\sim 0.003$ for $\beta \in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories.</description>

      <title>Area Scaling of Dynamical Degrees of Freedom in Regularised Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many canonical degrees of freedom does a quantum field theory actually use during its Hamiltonian evolution? For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $\lambda\phi^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RG flows and IR phases of QFTs can be constrained by generalized symmetries and their anomalies. Broken symmetries act on the space of coupling constants of families of theories, and can also have IR-constraining family anomalies. We generalize family anomaly considerations to cases of broken generalized/categorical symmetries, including higher-group and non-invertible symmetries. We consider the anomaly inflow and SymTFTs of such generalized families of QFTs, and their implications for RG flows and constraints on the IR phases. As examples, we apply family anomalies to study the IR phases of $4d$ QCD-like theories deformed by irrelevant, multi-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Analytical methods in Quantum Field Theories: from loop integrals to defect correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis expands the available techniques at weak coupling by investigating the linear space of Feynman integrals and the role that (super)symmetry plays in reducing the number of integrals necessary to calculate correlators in the presence of a one-dimensional extended operator - the line defect. In the first part, linear relations among Feynman parametrized integrals are derived from their properties as projective forms; these relations are then tested on one- and multi-loop examples, and their connection to the algebra of polynomial ideals is uncovered. In the second part, made of two chapters, the defect CFT formed by the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the presence of a Maldacena-Wilson line is studied through bulk-defect-defect and multipoint correlation functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion at weak coupling. The investigations into this defect CFT lead to the identification of classes of integrals containing all the perturbative information necessary to compute the correlators, which turn out to be either rational functions or Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations found 12 candidates for microlensing events. These events can be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6} M_\odot$ and a fraction of all dark matter of $f_\mathrm{PBH} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In this paper, we consider the PBH production in two types of the axionlike curvaton models, which predict an enhancement of the curvature perturbations on small scales. We show that the microlensing events can be explained in the axionlike curvaton model and discuss the cosmological implications such as gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Colour confinement and gauge-invariant field-strength correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we produce evidence that confinement of colour is due to dual superconductivity of $QCD$ vacuum. To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $\mu$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\langle \mu \rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\langle \mu \rangle \neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\langle \mu \rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.
  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.
  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on using density dependent $\Lambda$-nuclear optical potentials in calculations of $\Lambda$-hypernuclear binding energies is reviewed. It is found that all known $\Lambda$ binding energies in the mass range $16 \leq A \leq 208$ are well fitted in terms of two interaction parameters: one, attractive, for the spin-averaged $\Lambda N$ interaction and another one, repulsive, for the $\Lambda NN$ interaction. The $\Lambda N$ interaction term by itself overbinds $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, in quantitative agreement with recent findings obtained in EFT and Femtoscopy studies. The strength of the $\Lambda NN$ interaction term is compatible with values required to resolve the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <title>$D\bar{D}$ interactions are weak near threshold in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study near-threshold $D\bar{D}$ scattering in $S$ and $D$-wave to determine whether or not resonances or bound states are present. Working in the approximation where charm-annihilation is forbidden, with two degenerate light-quark flavors and a heavier strange quark, isospin is a good quantum number, and the only other other channel that is kinematically open is $\eta_c\eta$. Using lattice QCD we compute, as a function of varying light-quark mass, the $S$-matrix for coupled-channel $\eta_c\eta - D\bar{D}$ scattering and find only weakly interacting meson pairs. In contrast to several other studies, we find no evidence for any bound-state or resonance singularity in the energy region between the deeply-bound $\chi_{c0}(1P)$ state and the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Constraining long-lived dark sector particles with CMB and Lyman-$\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to place new limits on models in which long-lived dark sector (DS) particles, with lifetimes longer than $10^{16}$ s, deposit energy into the IGM through their decays. Such DS decays into Standard Model (SM) states can modify the late-time thermal history of the IGM, making Lyman-$\alpha$ data a sensitive probe of hidden sectors with cosmologically long lifetimes. Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space. We further revisit limits on such decaying DS models from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and provide updates relevant for DS lifetimes longer than $10^{14}$ s. The model-independent constraints on the DS parameter space we derive in this work can be reinterpreted for a wide range of decaying hidden-sector scenarios, including evaporating primordial black holes and SM-coupled dark photons.</description>

      <title>Charting the new physics through one-loop effects in the muon magnetic dipole moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the announcement of the muon $g-2$ measurements, numerous studies have been devoted to exploring the new physics through this precision probe. In specific models, the new physics contributions depend on the couplings and mass scales. Approximate formulae are widely adopted when determining the new physics contributions. This manuscript is dedicated to comprehensive analytical results and approximations for the canonical interactions at one-loop level, which is universal for the spin-half fermions and can serve as a useful reference for the magnetic dipole moment calculations. We present the analytic and approximate expressions for the scalar and vector mediator cases, supplemented by explicit examples in specific models to illustrate their applications. For given muon interactions, we can estimate both the sign and magnitude of the contributions conveniently. Furthermore, we investigate the broader physical implications of these results, offering insights into potential new physics.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. Through a careful analysis of photon generation induced by DPDM on the various optical elements of JWST, we find that the contribution of these photons to the detected signal is negligible. Nevertheless, we propose a modified configuration of the JWST mirrors that would enable the DPDM-induced photons to be focused onto the detector. This approach can be applied to future space telescopes during their ground-testing phases. Using the JWST parameters as a representative example, the achievable upper limits on the DPDM-photon mixing constant are $\epsilon\sim 10^{-12}-10^{-14}$ in the frequency range $10-500$~THz at the 95\% confidence level. This reveals the strong potential of future space telescopes for DPDM detection during ground testing, with sensitivities exceeding current limits by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the XENON1T result and the solar cooling bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore models where single new exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric Standard Model portal with couplings to at least one quark and one lepton. All effective operators up to dimension six where such interactions couple the SM to spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles are written down, and the exotic states accessible through the portal are identified. We note interactions that couple the SM to new particles with exotic combinations of baryon and lepton numbers, states of higher electric charge, and particles with unusual SM charge, including states in higher-dimensional representations of both SU(3) and SU(2). Finally, we discuss the phenomenology of these interactions, including novel particle decays, and we classify some of the collider production modes for exotic states at the LHC, LHeC and muon colliders.</description>

      <title>Endpoint Factorization for Semileptonic Decays of Boosted and Resonant Off-Shell Top Quarks with a Large-Radius Bottom Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a factorization formula for boosted double resonant top-antitop pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation with a semileptonic top quark decay in the phase space region where the $b$-jet invariant mass is small. The decaying top quark state is defined through invariant mass measurements on the final states in the top and antitop hemispheres, and the $b$-jet is defined from clustering all hadrons in the top hemisphere. The factorization does not rely on the narrow width limit and accounts for the QCD off-shell and interference effects. The approach employs Soft-Collinear-Effective Theory and boosted Heavy-Quark-Effective-Theory and relies on a combination of factorization theorems known from $e^+e^-$ dijet production and inclusive semileptonic heavy meson endpoint decays. The result provides a first principles treatment of the dominant hadronization effects, which can be determined from $e^+e^-$ event shapes. In the factorization a new distribution function arises, called the ultra-collinear-soft (ucs) function, which encodes the Fermi motion of the decaying top quark within the state defined from the invariant mass measurement. The ucs function is a differential generalization of the inclusive bHQET jet function and shares properties of the shape function in semileptonic heavy meson decays. In frames where the top quark is very slow, it describes the coherent soft radiation arising from top production, propagation and decay, and encodes all effects that are non-factorizable from the perspective of the NW limit. Its form and renormalization depend on two light-cone momenta related to the top-jet and $b$-jet directions and their relative angle. Due to the large top quark width, the ucs function can be computed perturbatively, and we determine the QCD corrections at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$. The anomalous dimension is known to three loops.</description>

Abstract: We present data-driven, state-of-the-art constraints on the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\,\mathrm{TeV}$. We perform global Bayesian calibration using the JETSCAPE multistage framework with two particlization ans\"atze, Grad 14-moment and first-order Chapman-Enskog, and quantify theoretical uncertainties via a centrality-dependent model discrepancy term. When theoretical uncertainties are neglected, the specific bulk viscosity and some model parameters inferred using the two ans\"atze exhibit clear tension. Once theoretical uncertainties are quantified, the Grad and Chapman-Enskog posteriors for all model parameters become almost statistically indistinguishable and yield reliable, uncertainty-aware constraints. Furthermore, the learned discrepancy identifies where each model falls short for specific observables and centrality classes, providing insight into model limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the Higgs rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$ within the next to minimum B-L supersymmetric model(NB-LSSM), where $V$ represents a vector meson $(\phi,J/\psi,\Upsilon(1S),\rho^0,\omega)$. Compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM), the NB-LSSM introduces three singlet Higgs superfields, which mix with the Higgs doublets and affect the lightest Higgs boson mass and the Higgs couplings. The loop-induced contributions resulting from the effective $h^0Z\gamma$ coupling can produce new physics(NP) contributions, thereby affecting the theoretical predictions of rare decays significantly through the new parameters such as $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\lambda_2\cdot\cdot\cdot$. The results of this work can provide a reference for probing NP beyond standard model(SM).</description>

      <title>Parton model contributions as next-to-eikonal corrections to the dipole factorization of DIS and SIDIS at low $x_{Bj}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the next-to-eikonal (NEik) power corrections to inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at low $x$ beyond dipole factorization, which represent the eikonal result. The analysis is restricted to contributions arising from t-channel quark exchanges, thereby probing the quark background field of the target. For a transversely polarized virtual photon, the NEik corrections to inclusive DIS are expressed in terms of quark and antiquark collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), while the corresponding corrections to SIDIS are formulated in terms of the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum-dependent distribution (TMD). In contrast, for a longitudinally polarized photon, the NEik corrections to both inclusive DIS and SIDIS vanish at lowest order in $\alpha_{s}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that ultralight dark photons, which couple to the Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing, can potentially source galactic scale magnetic fields. Although these magnetic fields would be too weak to detect at present in galaxies due to plasma screening effects, we show that dark photons can provide the seed magnetic field strength ($10^{-20}$ G) required for dynamo amplification in galaxies. Such dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are consistent with observations of $\mu$G strength galactic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We propose two medium-baseline, kiloton-scale neutrino experiments to study neutrinos from LHC proton-proton collisions: SINE, a surface-based scintillator panel detector observing muon neutrinos from the CMS interaction point, and UNDINE, a water Cherenkov detector submerged in lake Geneva observing all-flavor neutrinos from LHCb. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate millions of neutrino interactions during the high-luminosity LHC era. We show that these datasets can constrain neutrino cross sections, charm production in $pp$ collisions, and strangeness enhancement as a solution to the cosmic-ray muon puzzle. SINE and UNDINE thus offer a cost-effective medium-baseline complement to the proposed short-baseline forward physics facility.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order induced gravitational waves generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. In this case, the induced gravitational waves include contributions from three types of source terms: scalar-scalar, tensor-scalar, and tensor-tensor. To distinguish them from second-order scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we refer to those generated by these three source terms as tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs). We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current pulsar timing array (PTA) observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

Abstract: We give an analytical expression for the in-plane polarization $P^{x}$, in heavy-ion collisions that has, to our knowledge, not been measured in heavy-ion collision experiments. We also carry out a numerical study of $P^{x}$ using a hydrodynamic model simulation as a cross-check for the analytical formula. It is found that if the temperature-gradient contribution is neglected the simulation result for $P^{x}$ qualitatively agrees with the analytical one. The prediction of $P^{x}$ can be tested in experiments and will contribute to provide a complete and consistent picture of spin phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields -- such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom -- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</description>

Abstract: The extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or lattice QCD data is an ill-posed inverse problem, where regularization strongly impacts both systematic uncertainties and the reliability of the results. We study a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct PDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian processes serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and constraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide range of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We quantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler divergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of the method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric approach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and reduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>

Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>
