      <title>Complex pseudo-partition functions in the Configurationally-Resolved Super-Transition-Array approach for radiative opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few years ago, Kurzweil and Hazak developed the Configurationally Resolved Super-Transition-Arrays (CRSTA) method for the computation of hot-plasma radiative opacity. Their approach, based on a temporal integration, is an important refinement of the standard Super-Transition-Arrays (STA) approach, which enables one to recover the underlying structure of the STAs, made of unresolved transition arrays. The CRSTA formalism relies on the use of complex pseudo partition functions, depending on the considered one-electron jump. In this article, we find that, despite the imaginary part, the doubly-recursive relation which was introduced in the original STA method to avoid problems due to alternating-sign terms in partition functions, is still applicable, robust, efficient, and exempt of numerical instabilities. This was rather unexpected, in particular because of the occurrence of trigonometric functions, or Chebyshev polynomials, which can be either positive or negative. We also show that, in the complex case, the recursion relation can be presented in a form where the vector of real and imaginary parts at a given iteration is therefore obtained by a sum of the rotated previous ones.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Phase Doubling and Entanglement in Coherent Many-Body Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quantum degenerate regime, atoms and molecules can occupy a single quantum state, forming coherent matter waves. Here reactions are described by nonlinear mixing of the matter waves, giving rise to quantum many-body chemistry, where spatial coherence is preserved between the reactants and products. While the phase matching of matter waves during the reaction process has been theoretically predicted, experimental confirmation has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of matter wave phase doubling when bosonic atoms pair into molecules. Using matter wave diffraction, we verify spatial phase coherence and observe a two-fold increase of phase in the molecular wavefunction, confirming the matter-wave version of phase doubling. The diffraction patterns also reveal non-classical correlations indicative of entangled atom pairs formed during the reaction. Our results establish molecular matter-wave diffraction as a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence and entanglement generation in chemically reactive quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Controlling Excitation Localization in Waveguide QED Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate excitation dynamics in one-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters coupled to a waveguide, focusing on localization and long-time population trapping. By combining time-domain simulations with spectral analysis of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to localization: geometry-induced subradiance and disorder-induced Anderson-like confinement. Spatially modulated emitter arrangements--such as single- and double-Gaussian transverse profiles--enable long-lived subradiant modes even in the absence of disorder, with decay rates that can be finely controlled via geometric parameters. In contrast, localization in uniform arrays emerges only when disorder breaks spatial symmetry and suppresses collective emission through interference. We track the crossover between geometric and disorder-induced regimes, finding that double-Gaussian profiles exhibit clear spatial signatures of this transition, while single-Gaussian configurations display more gradual changes. These results establish geometry and disorder as complementary tools for engineering long-lived quantum states in waveguide QED systems, with direct relevance for scalable implementations in photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Factor of 1000 suppression of the depolarization rate in ultracold thulium collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides are nowadays extensively used to investigate the properties of strongly correlated matter. Nevertheless, exploiting the Zeeman manifold of a lanthanide atom ground state is challenging due to the unavoidable presence of depolarization collisions. Here we demonstrate that in the case of the thulium atom, it is possible to suppress this depolarization by a factor of 1000 with a carefully tuned magnetic field thus opening the way for the efficient use of the Zeeman manifold in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Ground-State Transfer of Ultracold Bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the creation of ultracold samples of $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules in their rovibrational ground state. By investigating potentially suitable excited states using one- and two-photon spectroscopy, we have identified a pathway to the ground state via an exceptionally narrow intermediate state. Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), we create trapped samples of up to 3500 molecules at temperatures of 1 $\mu$K with one-way efficiencies of 71%. The lifetime of these samples is limited by a universal-rate two-body loss process, which could shed new light on similar loss mechanisms in other molecular species. Our results are a step towards establishing an alternative platform for the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-lived multilevel coherences and spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. The availability of numerous rotational states has inspired many proposed applications, including simulations of quantum magnetism, encodings of information in high-dimensional qudits, and synthetic dimensions with many synthetic lattice sites. Many of these applications are yet to be realised, primarily because engineering long-lived coherent superpositions of multiple rotational states is highly challenging. Here, we investigate how multilevel coherences between rotational states can be engineered by using optical tweezer traps operating close to a magic wavelength for a given pair of states. By performing precision Ramsey spectroscopy we find the exact magic wavelengths and sensitivities to detuning errors for multiple rotational state superpositions. We find that, for a trap polarised parallel to the quantisation axis, the magic wavelengths are closely clustered enabling long-lived coherence across multiple rotational states simultaneously. As an example, we demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. With modest experimental improvements, we predict that second-scale coherent dynamics of ten rotational states should be readily achievable.</description>

      <title>Nuclear clock based on the Th V ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a nuclear clock based on the Th V ion can surpass the accuracy of clocks built with other thorium ions. The Th$^{4+}$ ion has a rigid closed-shell core with zero total electron angular momentum, suppressing frequency shifts from black-body radiation and stray external fields that act mainly on electrons. We calculate the energy shift of the nuclear clock transition frequency in $^{229}$Th due to the Coulomb field of atomic electrons and find a relative frequency difference of $2.8 \times 10^{-7}$ between Th IV and Th V - twelve orders of magnitude larger than the projected $10^{-19}$ fractional uncertainty of a nuclear clock. We also perform calculations for Th V energy levels, ionization potential, static polarizability, and the black-body radiation shift of the nuclear line. Additionally, we determine the nuclear transition frequencies in two thorium ions and neutral atom:
  $\omega_N=2,020,406.964(70)$ GHz in Th III, $\omega_N=2,020,408.264(100)$ GHz in Th II, and
  $\omega_N=2,020,408.364(100)$ GHz in Th I.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for Enhancing Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the number of particles in a system often leads to qualitative changes in its properties, such as breaking of symmetries and the appearance of phase transitions. This renders a macroscopic system fundamentally different from its individual microscopic constituents. Lying between these extremes, mesoscopic systems exhibit microscopic fluctuations that influence behavior on longer length scales, leading to critical phenomena and dynamics. Therefore, tracing the properties of well-controlled mesoscopic systems can help bridge the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body systems. Here, we explore mesoscopic signatures of an optomechanical self-organization phase transition using arrays of cold atoms inside an optical cavity. By precisely engineering atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number, identify characteristic dynamical behaviors in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. These findings advance our understanding of particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atomic systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</description>
