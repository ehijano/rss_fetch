      <title>Drivers of Electric Vehicle Adoption in Nigeria: An Extended UTAUT Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) represent a significant advancement in automotive technology, utilizing electricity as a power source instead of traditional fossil fuels, while incorporating sophisticated navigation and autopilot systems. These vehicles align with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering a more environmentally sustainable alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Despite their potential, the adoption of EVs in developing nations such as Nigeria remains constrained. This study expands the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework by incorporating key enablers, including poor infrastructure, affordability issues, and government support, within the broader category of facilitating conditions. Additionally, it examines factors such as trust, performance expectations, social influences, and network externalities to identify the primary determinants influencing Nigerian consumers' propensity to adopt EVs. Results show that the percentage increase of H6 (facilitating conditions - behavioral intentions) compared to H5 (network externalities - behavioral intentions) is approximately 32.35%, indicating that traditional drivers significantly influence individuals' willingness to purchase EVs and are particularly strong factors in adoption decisions. The paper concludes with a discussion of these findings and proposes strategies for future research to further explore the barriers and drivers of EV adoption in Nigeria.</description>

      <title>American society keeps a lid on the number of deaths from guns and car accidents but not from mass shootings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of deaths from car accidents and from the unlawful use of guns can be described by logistic growth curves. The annual rates of both have traced completed logistic trajectories following which they have been self-regulated for many decades at what seems to be a homeostatic equilibrium level through legislative actions. Exception constitutes the number of deaths from mass shootings, which has been so far tracing an exponential trajectory. Despite the fact that mass-shooting deaths represent only 0.1 percent of all gun deaths today, they are poised to continue growing exponentially until they become the major cause of gun deaths, short of unprecedented action by society.</description>

      <title>The Role of Community Building and Education as Key Pillar of Institutionalizing Responsible Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging technology whose positive and negative impacts on society are not yet fully known. As government, individuals, institutions, and corporations fund and develop this technology, they must ensure that they anticipate its impacts, prepare for its consequences, and steer its development in such a way that it enables the most good and prevents the most harm. However, individual stakeholders are not equipped to fully anticipate these consequences on their own it requires a diverse community that is well-informed about quantum computing and its impacts. Collaborations and community-building across domains incorporating a variety of viewpoints, especially those from stakeholders most likely to be harmed, are fundamental pillars of developing and deploying quantum computing responsibly. This paper reviews responsible quantum computing proposals and literature, highlights the challenges in implementing these, and presents strategies developed at IBM aimed at building a diverse community of users and stakeholders to support the responsible development of this technology.</description>

      <title>From Phytochemicals to Recipes: Health Indications and Culinary Uses of Herbs and Spices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbs and spices each contain about 3000 phytochemicals on average and there is much traditional knowledge on their health benefits. However, there is a lack of systematic study to understand the relationship among herbs and spices, their phytochemical constituents, their potential health benefits, and their usage in regional cuisines. Here we use a network-based approach to elucidate established relationships and predict novel associations between the phytochemicals present in herbs and spices with health indications. Our top 100 inferred indication-phytochemical relationships rediscover 40% known relationships and 20% that have been inferred via gene-chemical interactions with high confidence. The remaining 40% are hypotheses generated in a principled way for further experimental investigations. We also develop an algorithm to find the minimum set of spices needed to cover a target group of health conditions. Drawing on spice usage patterns in several regional Indian cuisines, and a copy-mutate model for regional cuisine evolution, we characterize the spectrum of health conditions covered by existing regional cuisines. The spectrum of health conditions can expand through the nationalization/globalization of culinary practice.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Assessing Inclusivity and Empowerment of People for Supporting the Design of Inclusive Product Lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of an inclusive product lifecycle is important for empowering people (stakeholders) with their meaningful inclusion in lifecycle processes. The aim is to use this as an enabler for transition to sustainability by balancing the power relations among the stakeholders. Design of an inclusive product lifecycle for empowerment requires that the nature of inclusion of stakeholders in the lifecycle is such that it leads to their empowerment. Empowerment processes provide opportunities for people to increase their power to sustain the development of inclusive product lifecycles. Analysing power relations is to balance the amount of power of stakeholders with their inclusion in different functions in an inclusive lifecycle design. Inclusivity addresses the context of the lifecycle process to determine who can be included in which phases of the lifecycle and the diversity of people to be empowered. We apply a novel empowerment and inclusivity framework to a series of real-life case studies from literature to identify the major dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity. By analysing the relationships between the dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity, we propose specific metrics for inclusivity and empowerment that have strong causal connections, indicating the kinds of inclusion that should lead to greater empowerment in product lifecycles.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics model of collaborative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model to explore an educational phenomenon where the correct answer emerges from group discussion. We construct our model based on several plausible assumptions: (i) We tend to follow peers' opinions. However, if a peer's opinion is too different from yours, you are not much influenced. In other words, your opinion tends to align with peers' opinions, weighted by the similarity to yours. (ii) Discussion among group members helps the opinion to shift toward the correct answer even when the group members do not know it clearly. However, if everyone tells exactly the same, you often get lost and it becomes more difficult to find the correct answer. In other words, you can find the correct answer when everyone has largely different voices. (iii) We are sometimes stuck to our past. If you keep one opinion for a long time, such a memory works like an inertia in classical mechanics. We use our model to perform numerical investigations and find that the performance of a group is enhanced when initial opinions are diverse, that a lower memory capacity makes consensus occur faster, and that a small group size, typically three or four, is beneficial for better group performance.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Geometric Partition Entropy for the Estimation of Mutual Information in the Presence of Informative Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new viewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the impacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to the context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of geometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded (finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition invokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and reliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct theoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of approximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current methods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\pi$) approximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in any context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information estimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory allows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation of outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability of established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative outliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the synchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Parallel Boarding Methods in a Multi-Aisle Flying Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17870v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the speed of different boarding methods in a proposed Flying Wing aircraft design with four aisles using an agent-based model. We study the effect of various passenger movement variables on the boarding process. We evaluate the impact of these factors on the boarding time when the boarding process runs sequentially and in parallel with the aisles of the Flying Wing layout. Then, we analyze the impact of an increase in the number of aisles on the relative speed of all boarding methods and conclude that methods utilizing boarding of the separate aisles simultaneously (parallel boarding) converge to the fastest boarding time given by the Steffen method. With parallel boarding of the aisles the relative advantage of the Steffen method compared to Windows-Middle-Aisle (WMA) or Back-to-front boarding decreases, from being 1.6-2.1 times as fast to being approximately equal for our fiducial Flying Wing seating arrangement. Standard methods such as Back-to-front or WMA are about twice as fast to board a four-aisle Flying Wing plane, compared to a single-aisle aircraft with the same number of passengers. We also investigate the difference between the optimal approach to parallel boarding, where consecutive passengers always enter separate aisles, and a less optimal but more practical approach. The practical approach is only up to 1.06 times slower than the optimal, meaning that the advantages of parallel boarding can be utilized without resorting to impractical boarding methods. Hence, the introduction of multiple aisles into aircraft seating design offers the prospect of significantly decreasing the boarding time for passengers, without the introduction of inconvenient boarding methods.</description>

      <title>Partially Proportional and Adaptive Similarity Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good deal of science and technology concepts and methods rely on comparing and relating entities in quantitative terms. Among the several possible approaches, similarity indices allow some interesting features, especially the ability to quantify how much two entities resemble one another. In this work, the Jaccard similarity for comparing non-zero real-valued vectors is modified so as to estimate similarity while focusing on the distinct parts of the signals. The resulting operator, which is called partially proportional similarity index, not only allows more strict comparisons, but also paves the way to develop an adaptive approach to similarity estimation in which the size and orientation of the comparisons adapt to those of a respective calibration field expressing how the observed features are related to original counterparts. Being a particularly relevant concept in data analysis and modeling, emphasis is placed on presenting and discussing the concept of calibration field and how they can be taken into account while performing similarity comparisons. Several results are described which illustrate the potential of the reported concepts and approaches for enhancing, and even simultaneously normalizing to some extent the representation of entities in terms of their features, as frequently required in scientific modeling and pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>

      <title>Dynamic models of gentrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of gentrification of an urban area is characterized by the displacement of lower-income residents due to rising living costs and an influx of wealthier individuals. This study presents an agent-based model that simulates urban gentrification through the relocation of three income groups -- low, middle, and high -- driven by living costs. The model incorporates economic and sociological theories to generate realistic neighborhood transition patterns. We introduce a temporal network-based measure to track the outflow of low-income residents and the inflow of middle- and high-income residents over time. Our experiments reveal that high-income residents trigger gentrification and that our network-based measure consistently detects gentrification patterns earlier than traditional count-based methods, potentially serving as an early detection tool in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the analysis also highlights how city density promotes gentrification. This framework offers valuable insights for understanding gentrification dynamics and informing urban planning and policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Disease Outbreak Detection and Forecasting: A Review of Methods and Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infectious diseases occur when pathogens from other individuals or animals infect a person, resulting in harm to both individuals and society as a whole. The outbreak of such diseases can pose a significant threat to human health. However, early detection and tracking of these outbreaks have the potential to reduce the mortality impact. To address these threats, public health authorities have endeavored to establish comprehensive mechanisms for collecting disease data. Many countries have implemented infectious disease surveillance systems, with the detection of epidemics being a primary objective. The clinical healthcare system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional groups, and collaborating governmental entities all play pivotal roles within this system. Moreover, nowadays, search engines and social media platforms can serve as valuable tools for monitoring disease trends. The Internet and social media have become significant platforms where users share information about their preferences and relationships. This real-time information can be harnessed to gauge the influence of ideas and societal opinions, making it highly useful across various domains and research areas, such as marketing campaigns, financial predictions, and public health, among others. This article provides a review of the existing standard methods developed by researchers for detecting outbreaks using time series data. These methods leverage various data sources, including conventional data sources and social media data or Internet data sources. The review particularly concentrates on works published within the timeframe of 2015 to 2022.</description>

      <title>Detecting fake review buyers using network structure: Direct evidence from Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reviews significantly impact consumers' decision-making process and firms' economic outcomes and are widely seen as crucial to the success of online markets. Firms, therefore, have a strong incentive to manipulate ratings using fake reviews. This presents a problem that academic researchers have tried to solve over two decades and on which platforms expend a large amount of resources. Nevertheless, the prevalence of fake reviews is arguably higher than ever. To combat this, we collect a dataset of reviews for thousands of Amazon products and develop a general and highly accurate method for detecting fake reviews. A unique difference between previous datasets and ours is that we directly observe which sellers buy fake reviews. Thus, while prior research has trained models using lab-generated reviews or proxies for fake reviews, we are able to train a model using actual fake reviews. We show that products that buy fake reviews are highly clustered in the product-reviewer network. Therefore, features constructed from this network are highly predictive of which products buy fake reviews. We show that our network-based approach is also successful at detecting fake reviews even without ground truth data, as unsupervised clustering methods can accurately identify fake review buyers by identifying clusters of products that are closely connected in the network. While text or metadata can be manipulated to evade detection, network-based features are more costly to manipulate because these features result directly from the inherent limitations of buying reviews from online review marketplaces, making our detection approach more robust to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Company Growth by Econophysics informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting company growth is crucial for strategic adjustment, operational decision-making, risk assessment, and loan eligibility reviews. Traditional models for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical forecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques, ignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that incorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both the intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the fluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use time series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range prediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility components, our model is more interpretable.</description>

      <title>The Negative Participation Paradox in Three-Candidate Instant Runoff Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18857</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical estimates for the likelihood of a negative participation paradox under instant runoff voting in three-candidate elections. We determine the probability of the paradox and related conditional probabilities based on the impartial anonymous culture and impartial culture models for both complete and partial ballots. We compare these results to the empirical likelihood of a negative participation paradox occurring under instant runoff voting in a large database of voter profiles which have been reduced to three candidates. Lastly, we analyze the relative likelihood of this paradox in comparison to other well-known paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like approaches unveil the intrinsic limits of predictability in compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate forecasts for the evolution of epidemic outbreaks from deterministic compartmental models represents a major theoretical challenge. Recently, it has been shown that these models typically exhibit trajectories' degeneracy, as different sets of epidemiological parameters yield comparable predictions at early stages of the outbreak but disparate future epidemic scenarios. Here we use the Doi-Peliti approach and extend the classical deterministic SIS and SIR models to a quantum-like formalism to explore whether the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts is also shaped by the stochastic nature of epidemic processes. This approach allows getting a probabilistic ensemble of trajectories, revealing that epidemic uncertainty is not uniform across time, being maximal around the epidemic peak and vanishing at both early and very late stages of the outbreak. Our results therefore show that, independently of the models' complexity, the stochasticity of contagion and recover processes poses a natural constraint for the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts.</description>
