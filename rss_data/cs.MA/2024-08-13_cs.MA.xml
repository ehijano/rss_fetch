      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.</description>

      <title>The Bandit Whisperer: Communication Learning for Restless Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Restless Multi-Arm Bandits (RMABs) offers a promising avenue for addressing allocation problems with resource constraints and temporal dynamics. However, classic RMAB models largely overlook the challenges of (systematic) data errors - a common occurrence in real-world scenarios due to factors like varying data collection protocols and intentional noise for differential privacy. We demonstrate that conventional RL algorithms used to train RMABs can struggle to perform well in such settings. To solve this problem, we propose the first communication learning approach in RMABs, where we study which arms, when involved in communication, are most effective in mitigating the influence of such systematic data errors. In our setup, the arms receive Q-function parameters from similar arms as messages to guide behavioral policies, steering Q-function updates. We learn communication strategies by considering the joint utility of messages across all pairs of arms and using a Q-network architecture that decomposes the joint utility. Both theoretical and empirical evidence validate the effectiveness of our method in significantly improving RMAB performance across diverse problems.</description>

      <title>Fast and Communication-Efficient Multi-UAV Exploration Via Voronoi Partition on Dynamic Topological Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data transmission and reasonable task allocation are important to improve multi-robot exploration efficiency. However, most communication data types typically contain redundant information and thus require massive communication volume. Moreover, exploration-oriented task allocation is far from trivial and becomes even more challenging for resource-limited unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we propose a fast and communication-efficient multi-UAV exploration method for exploring large environments. We first design a multi-robot dynamic topological graph (MR-DTG) consisting of nodes representing the explored and exploring regions and edges connecting nodes. Supported by MR-DTG, our method achieves efficient communication by only transferring the necessary information required by exploration planning. To further improve the exploration efficiency, a hierarchical multi-UAV exploration method is devised using MR-DTG. Specifically, the \emph{graph Voronoi partition} is used to allocate MR-DTG's nodes to the closest UAVs, considering the actual motion cost, thus achieving reasonable task allocation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address multi-UAV exploration using \emph{graph Voronoi partition}. The proposed method is compared with a state-of-the-art method in simulations. The results show that the proposed method is able to reduce the exploration time and communication volume by up to 38.3\% and 95.5\%, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of our method is validated in the real-world experiment with 6 UAVs. We will release the source code to benefit the community.</description>

      <title>Optimizing RAG Techniques for Automotive Industry PDF Chatbots: A Case Study with Locally Deployed Ollama Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for offline PDF chatbots in automotive industrial production environments, optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in local, low-performance settings has become increasingly important. This study focuses on enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing complex automotive industry documents using locally deployed Ollama models. Based on the Langchain framework, we propose a multi-dimensional optimization approach for Ollama's local RAG implementation. Our method addresses key challenges in automotive document processing, including multi-column layouts and technical specifications. We introduce improvements in PDF processing, retrieval mechanisms, and context compression, tailored to the unique characteristics of automotive industry documents. Additionally, we design custom classes supporting embedding pipelines and an agent supporting self-RAG based on LangGraph best practices. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a proprietary dataset comprising typical automotive industry documents, including technical reports and corporate regulations. We compared our optimized RAG model and self-RAG agent against a naive RAG baseline across three datasets: our automotive industry dataset, QReCC, and CoQA. Results demonstrate significant improvements in context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness, with particularly notable performance on the automotive industry dataset. Our optimization scheme provides an effective solution for deploying local RAG systems in the automotive sector, addressing the specific needs of PDF chatbots in industrial production environments. This research has important implications for advancing information processing and intelligent production in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing-Based Algorithm for Efficient Coalition Formation Among LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, driven by lower manufacturing and launch costs, is proving invaluable for Earth observation missions and low-latency internet connectivity. However, as the number of satellites increases, the number of communication links to maintain also rises, making the management of this vast network increasingly challenging and highlighting the need for clustering satellites into efficient groups as a promising solution. This paper formulates the clustering of LEO satellites as a coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and leverages quantum annealing to solve it. We represent the satellite network as a graph and obtain the optimal partitions using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called GCS-Q. The algorithm follows a top-down approach by iteratively splitting the graph at each step using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. To evaluate our approach, we utilize real-world three-line element set (TLE/3LE) data for Starlink satellites from Celestrak. Our experiments, conducted using the D-Wave Advantage annealer and the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi, demonstrate that the quantum annealer significantly outperforms classical methods in terms of runtime while maintaining the solution quality. The performance achieved with quantum annealers surpasses the capabilities of classical computers, highlighting the transformative potential of quantum computing in optimizing the management of large-scale satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.</description>

      <title>Team Coordination on Graphs: Problem, Analysis, and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Team Coordination on Graphs with Risky Edges (TCGRE) is a recently emerged problem, in which a robot team collectively reduces graph traversal cost through support from one robot to another when the latter traverses a risky edge. Resembling the traditional Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, both classical and learning-based methods have been proposed to solve TCGRE, however, they lacked either computational efficiency or optimality assurance. In this paper, we reformulate TCGRE as a constrained optimization problem and perform a rigorous mathematical analysis. Our theoretical analysis shows the NP-hardness of TCGRE by reduction from the Maximum 3D Matching problem and that efficient decomposition is a key to tackle this combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, we design three classes of algorithms to solve TCGRE, i.e., Joint State Graph (JSG) based, coordination based, and receding-horizon sub-team based solutions. Each of these proposed algorithms enjoy different provable optimality and efficiency characteristics that are demonstrated in our extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Message-Passing and Zeroth-Order Optimization Based Distributed Learning with a Use-Case in Resource Allocation in Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local rewards or a global reward, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global reward equal to aggregated local rewards) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local reward). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., reward function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</description>

      <title>TrustAgent: Towards Safe and Trustworthy LLM-based Agents through Agent Constitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments. Data and code are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent.</description>
