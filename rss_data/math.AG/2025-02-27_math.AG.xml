      <title>On Stein spaces with finite homotopy rank-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space (not necessarily simply connected) is said to have finite homotopy rank-sum if the sum of the ranks of all higher homotopy groups (from the second homotopy group onward) is finite. In this article, we consider Stein spaces of arbitrary dimension satisfying the above rational homotopy theoretic property, although most of this article focuses on Stein surfaces only. We characterize all Stein surfaces satisfying the finite homotopy rank-sum property. In particular, if such a Stein surface is affine and every element of its fundamental group is finite, it is either simply connected or has a fundamental group of order $2$. A detailed classification of the smooth complex affine surfaces of the non-general type satisfying the finite homotopy rank-sum property is obtained. It turns out that these affine surfaces are Eilenberg--MacLane spaces whenever the fundamental group is infinite.</description>

      <title>Algebraic surfaces as Hadamard products of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projective surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ which can be written as Hadamard product of two curves. We show that quadratic surfaces which are Hadamard product of two lines are smooth and tangent to all coordinate planes, and such tangency points uniquely identify the quadric. The variety of such quadratic surfaces corresponds to the Zariski closure of the space of symmetric matrices whose inverse has null diagonal. For higher-degree surfaces which are Hadamard product of a line and a curve we show that the intersection with the coordinate planes is always non-transversal.</description>

Abstract: We study the equivariant Kuznetsov component $\mathrm{Ku}_G(X)$ of a general cubic fourfold $X$ with a symplectic involution. We show that $\mathrm{Ku}_G(X)$ is equivalent to the derived category $D^b(S)$ of a $K3$ surface $S$, where $S$ is given as a component of the fixed locus of the induced symplectic action on the Fano variety of lines on $X$.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative derived analytic moduli functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formulation for non-commutative derived analytic geometry built from differential graded (dg) algebras equipped with free entire functional calculus (FEFC), relating them to simplicial FEFC algebras and to locally multiplicatively convex complete topological dg algebras. The theory is optimally suited for accommodating analytic morphisms between functors of algebraic origin, and we establish forms of Riemann-Hilbert equivalence in this setting. We also investigate classes of topological dg algebras for which moduli functors of analytic origin tend to behave well, and relate their homotopy theory to that of FEFC algebras. Applications include the construction of derived non-commutative analytic moduli stacks of pro-\'etale local systems and non-commutative derived twistor moduli functors, both equipped with shifted analytic bisymplectic structures, and hence shifted analytic double Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Enumerative Geometry of Quantum Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret the $q$-refined theta function $\vartheta_1$ of a log Calabi-Yau surface $(\mathbb{P},E)$ as a natural $q$-refinement of the open mirror map, defined by quantum periods of mirror curves for outer Aganagic-Vafa branes on the local Calabi-Yau $K_{\mathbb{P}}$. The series coefficients are all-genus logarithmic two-point invariants, directly extending the relation found in [GRZ]. Yet we find an explicit discrepancy at higher genus in the relation to open Gromov-Witten invariants of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. Using a degeneration argument, we express the difference in terms of relative invariants of an elliptic curve. With $\pi: \widehat{\mathbb{P}} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ the toric blow up of a point, we use the Topological Vertex [AKMV] to show a correspondence between open invariants of $K_{\mathbb{P}}$ and closed invariants of $K_{\widehat{\mathbb{P}}}$ generalizing a variant of [CLLT][LLW] to arbitrary genus and winding. We also equate winding-1, open-BPS invariants with closed Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.</description>

      <title>Some topological aspects of a general spectra construction of Matsui and Takahashi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matsui and Takahashi introduce a general spectra construction for triangulated categories in [J. Math. Soc. Japan, 4:2121-2150,2020], which is later used to establish Matsui's theory of triangular geometry. In this paper, we study several topological aspects of this general construction and give criteria for soberness and spectralness of the spectra. Furthermore, we discuss and generalize the immersion phenomenon for Noetherian schemes as appeared in [Pacific. J. Math., 313(2):433-457, 2021]. The last section illustrates that similar immersions also appear if the underlying category has a well-defined finite group action. We work in the extriangulated context to incorporate similar ideas from the triangulated and abelian contexts.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Field Theory with vacuum and its Virasoro constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers on {\it Virasoro constraints for Cohomological Field Theory (CohFT)}. For a CohFT with vacuum, we introduce the concepts of $S$-calibration and $\nu$-calibration. Then, we define the (formal) total descendent potential corresponding to a given calibration. Finally, we introduce an additional structure, namely homogeneity, for both the CohFT and the calibrations.
  After these preliminary introductions, we propose two crucial conjectures: (1) the ancestor version of the Virasoro conjecture for the homogeneous CohFT with vacuum; and (2) the generalized Virasoro conjecture for the (formal) total descendent potential of a calibrated homogeneous CohFT. We verify the genus-0 part of these conjectures and deduce a simplified form of the genus-1 part of these conjectures for arbitrary CohFTs. Additionally, we prove the full conjectures for semisimple CohFTs.
  As applications, our results yield the Virasoro constraints for the deformed negative $r$-spin theory. Moreover, by applying the Virasoro constraints, we discover an extension of Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants theory which is widely studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Algebra and geometry of ASM weak order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11405v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many instances such that deformation space of the homology class of an algebraic cycle as a Hodge cycle is larger than its deformation space as algebraic cycle. This phenomena can occur for algebraic cycles inside hypersurfaces, however, we are only able to gather evidences for it by computer experiments. In this article we describe one example of this for cubic hypersurfaces. The verification of the mentioned phenomena in this case is proposed as the first GADEPs problem. The main goal is either to verify the (variational) Hodge conjecture in such a case or gather evidences that it might produce a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial theory of horospherical stacks which is motivated by the work of Geraschenko and Satriano on toric stacks. A horospherical stack corresponds to a combinatorial object called a stacky coloured fan. We give many concrete examples, including a class of easy-to-draw examples called coloured fantastacks. The main results in this paper are combinatorial descriptions of horospherical stacks, the morphisms between them, their decolourations, and their good moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>The McKay Correspondence for Dihedral Groups: The Moduli Space and the Tautological Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture in [Ish20] states that for a finite subgroup $G$ of $GL(2; \mathbb{C})$, a resolution $Y$ of $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ is isomorphic to a moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ of $G$-constellations for some generic stability parameter $\theta$ if and only if $Y$ is dominated by the maximal resolution. This paper affirms the conjecture in the case of dihedral groups as a class of complex reflection groups, and offers an extension of McKay correspondence (via [IN1], [IN2], and [Ish02]).

      <description>arXiv:2406.13432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove that for all primes $p\not=2,3$, the Ramanujan vector field has an invariant algebraic curve and then we give a moduli space interpretation of this curve in terms of Cartier operator acting on the de Rham cohomology of elliptic curves. The main ingredients of our study are due to Serre, Swinnerton-Dyer and Katz in 1973. We aim to generalize this for the theory of Calabi-Yau modular forms, which includes the generating function of genus $g$ Gromov-Witten invariants. The integrality of $q$-expansions of such modular forms is still a main conjecture which has been only established for special Calabi-Yau varieties, for instance those whose periods are hypergeometric functions. For this the main tools are Dwork's theorem. We present an alternative project which aims to prove such integralities using modular vector fields and Gauss-Manin connection in positive characteristic.</description>

We also aim to investigate a conjecture on the ring of definition of leaf schemes and its consequences such as the algebraicity of leaf schemes (Cattani-Deligne-Kaplan theorem in the case of Hodge loci). This conjecture is a consequence of a local-global principle for leaf schemes.</description>

      <title>Stable maps to quotient stacks with a properly stable point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compactify the moduli stack of maps from curves to certain quotient stacks $\mathcal{X}=[W/G]$ with a projective good moduli space, extending previous results from quasimap theory. For doing so, we introduce a new birational transformation for algebraic stacks, the extended weighted blow-up, to prove that any algebraic stack with a properly stable point can be enlarged so that it contains an open substack which is proper and Deligne-Mumford. As a first application, we use our main theorem to construct a compact moduli stack for certain fibered log-Calabi-Yau pairs. We further apply our result to construct a compactification of the space of maps to $\mathcal{X}$ when $\mathcal{X}$ is respectively: a quotient by a torus of a proper Deligne-Mumford stack; a GIT compactification of the stack of binary forms of degree $2n$; a GIT compactification of the stack of $2n$-marked smooth rational curves, and a GIT compactification of the stack of smooth plane cubics. In the appendix, we give a criterion for when a morphism of algebraic stacks is an extended weighted blow-up, and we use it in order to give a modular proof of a conjecture of Hassett on weighted pointed rational curves.</description>

      <title>Type II Degenerations of K3 Surfaces of Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Type II degenerations of K3 surfaces of degree 4 where the central fiber consists of two rational components glued along an elliptic curve. Such degenerations are called Tyurin degenerations. We construct explicit Tyurin degenerations corresponding to each of the 1-dimensional boundary components of the Baily-Borel compactification of the moduli space of K3 surfaces of degree 4. For every such boundary component we also construct an 18-dimensional family of Tyurin degenerations of K3 surfaces of degree 4 and compute the stable models of these degenerations.</description>

      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that linear differential equations with only algebraic solutions have zero $m$-curvature modulo $p^k$ for all except a finite number of primes $p$ and all $k,m\in\mathbb N$ with ${\rm ord}_pm!\geq k$. This provides us with a reformulation of Grothendieck-Katz conjecture with stronger hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Activation degree thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.</description>

      <title>Quantum integrable model for the quantum cohomology/K-theory of flag varieties and the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertex spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials.</description>
