      <title>Parabolic cylinder functions revisited using the Laplace transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we gather and extend classical results for parabolic cylinder functions, namely solutions of the Weber differential equations, using a systematic approach by Borel-Laplace methods.
  We revisit the definition and construction of the standard solutions $U,V$ of the Weber differential equation \begin{equation*} w''(z)-\left(\frac{z^2}{4}+a\right)w(z)=0 \end{equation*} and provide representations by Laplace integrals extended to include all values of the complex parameter $a$; we find an integral integral representation for the function $V$; none was previously available.
  For the Weber equation in the form \begin{equation*}
  u''(x)+\left(\frac{x^2}{4}-a\right)u(x)=0, \end{equation*} we define a new fundamental system $E_\pm$ which is analytic in $a\in\mathbb{C}$, based on asymptotic behavior; they appropriately extend and modify the classical solutions $E,E^*$ of the real Weber equation to the complex domain.
  The techniques used are general and we include details and motivations for the approach.</description>

      <title>On almost everywhere convergence of planar Bochner-Riesz mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the almost everywhere convergence of the planar Bochner-Riesz means for $L^p$ functions in the optimal range when $5/3\leq p\leq 2$. This is achieved by establishing a sharp $L^{5/3}$ estimate for a maximal operator closely associated with the Bochner-Riesz multiplier operator. The estimate depends on a novel refined $L^2$ estimate, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Darboux equivalence for matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give some criteria that allow us to decide when two sequences of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials are related via a Darboux transformation and to build explicitly such transformation. In particular, they allow us to see when and how any given sequence of polynomials is Darboux related to a diagonal matrix of classic orthogonal polynomials. We also explore the notion of Darboux-irreducibility and study some sequences that are not a Darboux transformation of classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>The restricted discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the restriction of the discrete Fourier transform $F_N : L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z}) \to L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ to the space $\mathcal C_a$ of functions with support on the discrete interval $[-a,a]$, whose transforms are supported inside the same interval. A periodically tridiagonal matrix $J$ on $L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ is constructed having the three properties that it commutes with $F_N$, has eigenspaces of dimensions 1 and 2 only, and the span of its eigenspaces of dimension 1 is precisely $\mathcal C_a$. The simple eigenspaces of $J$ provide an orthonormal eigenbasis of the restriction of $F_N$ to $\mathcal C_a$. The dimension 2 eigenspaces of $J$ have canonical basis elements supported on $[-a,a]$ and its complement. These bases give an interpolation formula for reconstructing $f(x)\in L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ from the values of $f(x)$ and $\widehat f(x)$ on $[-a,a]$, i.e., an explicit Fourier uniqueness pair interpolation formula. The coefficients of the interpolation formula are expressed in terms of theta functions. Lastly, we construct an explicit basis of $\mathcal C_a$ having extremal support and leverage it to obtain explicit formulas for eigenfunctions of $F_N$ in $C_a$ when $\dim \mathcal C_a \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of singular points of linear differential equations is a classical technique to study the properties of irregular singular points from those of regular singular points. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the unfolding of unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. As one of main results, we give a description for the unfolding of singularities of connections as the deformation of moduli spaces of them, and show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has a deformation to a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we can consider the unfolding of additive Delinge-Simpson problems, namely, the unfolding of irregular singularities generates a family of additive Deligne-Simpson problems. Then as an application of our main result, we show that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities has a solution if and only if every other unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem simultaneously has a solution. Also we give a combinatorial and diagrammatic description of the unfolding of irregular singularities via spectral types and unfolding diagrams, and then consider a conjecture proposed by Oshima which asks the existence of irreducible $G$-connections realizing the given spectral types and their unfolding. Our main result gives an affirmative answer of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Memristive Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of memristive devices offers a promising avenue for efficient and scalable analog computing, particularly for linear algebra operations essential in various scientific and engineering applications. This paper investigates the potential of memristive crossbars in implementing matrix inversion algorithms. We explore both static and dynamic approaches, emphasizing the advantages of analog and in-memory computing for matrix operations beyond multiplication. Our results demonstrate that memristive arrays can significantly reduce computational complexity and power consumption compared to traditional digital methods for certain matrix tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenges of device variability, precision, and scalability, providing insights into the practical implementation of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Observability of the heat equation from very small sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the heat equation set on a bounded $C^1$ domain of $\mathbb R^n$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The first purpose of this paper is to prove that the heat equation is observable from any measurable set $\omega$ with positive $(n-1+\delta)$-Hausdorff content, for $\delta &gt;0$ arbitrary small. The proof relies on a new spectral estimate for linear combinations of Laplace eigenfunctions, obtained via a Remez type inequality, and the use of the so-called Lebeau-Robbiano's method. Even if this observability result is sharp with respect to the scale of Hausdorff dimension, our second goal is to construct families of sets $\omega$ which have codimension greater than or equal to $1$ for which the heat equation remains observable.</description>

      <title>A characterization of compactness via bilinear $T1$ theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve a long standing problem about the bilinear $T1$ theorem to characterize the (weighted) compactness of bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators. Let $T$ be a bilinear operator associated with a standard bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund kernel. We prove that $T$ can be extended to a compact bilinear operator from $L^{p_1}(w_1^{p_1}) \times L^{p_2}(w_2^{p_2})$ to $L^p(w^p)$ for all exponents $\frac1p = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}&gt;0$ with $p_1, p_2 \in (1, \infty]$ and for all weights $(w_1, w_2) \in A_{(p_1, p_2)}$ if and only if the following hypotheses hold: (H1) $T$ is associated with a compact bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund kernel, (H2) $T$ satisfies the weak compactness property, and (H3) $T(1,1), T^{*1}(1,1), T^{*2}(1,1) \in \mathrm{CMO}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. This is also equivalent to the endpoint compactness: (1) $T$ is compact from $L^1(w_1) \times L^1(w_2)$ to $L^{\frac12, \infty}(w^{\frac12})$ for all $(w_1, w_2) \in A_{(1, 1)}$, or (2) $T$ is compact from $L^{\infty}(w_1^{\infty}) \times L^{\infty}(w_2^{\infty})$ to $\mathrm{CMO}_{\lambda}(w^{\infty})$ for all $(w_1, w_2) \in A_{(\infty, \infty)}$. Besides, any of these properties is equivalent to the fact that $T$ admits a compact bilinear dyadic representation.
  Our main approaches consist of the following new ingredients: (i) a resulting representation of a compact bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operator as an average of some compact bilinear dyadic shifts and paraproducts; (ii) extrapolation of endpoint compactness for bilinear operators; and (iii) compactness criterion in weighted Lorentz spaces. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of our result, we demonstrate the hypotheses (H1)-(H3) through examples including bilinear continuous/dyadic paraproducts, bilinear pseudo-differential operators, and bilinear commutators.</description>

      <title>Uniform extension of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that definable Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer and $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity, are the restrictions of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-functions; "definable" refers to an arbitrary given o-minimal expansion of the real field. This is true in a uniform way: any definable bounded family of Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$ extends to a definable bounded family of $C^{m,\omega}$-functions. We also discuss a uniform $C^m$-version and how the extension depends on the modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Random subsets of Cantor sets generated by trees of coin flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural way to construct a random subset of a homogeneous Cantor set $C$ in $[0,1]$ via random labelings of an infinite $M$-ary tree, where $M\geq 2$. The Cantor set $C$ is the attractor of an equicontractive iterated function system $\{f_1,\dots,f_N\}$ that satisfies the open set condition with $(0,1)$ as the open set. For a fixed probability vector $(p_1,\dots,p_N)$, each edge in the infinite $M$-ary tree is independently labeled $i$ with probability $p_i$, for $i=1,2,\dots,N$. Thus, each infinite path in the tree receives a random label sequence of numbers from $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$. We define $F$ to be the (random) set of those points $x\in C$ which have a coding that is equal to the label sequence of some infinite path starting at the root of the tree.
  The set $F$ may be viewed as a statistically self-similar set with extreme overlaps, and as such, its Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions coincide. We prove non-trivial upper and lower bounds for this dimension, and obtain the exact dimension in a few special cases. For instance, when $M=N$ and $p_i=1/N$ for each $i$, we show that $F$ is almost surely of full Hausdorff dimension in $C$ but of zero Hausdorff measure in its dimension.
  For the case of two maps and a binary tree, we also consider deterministic labelings of the tree where, for a fixed integer $m\geq 2$, every $m$th edge is labeled $1$, and compute the exact Hausdorff dimension of the resulting subset of $C$.</description>
