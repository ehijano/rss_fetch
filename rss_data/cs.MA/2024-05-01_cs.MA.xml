      <title>A Meta-Game Evaluation Framework for Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms is complicated by stochasticity in training and sensitivity of agent performance to the behavior of other agents. We propose a meta-game evaluation framework for deep MARL, by framing each MARL algorithm as a meta-strategy, and repeatedly sampling normal-form empirical games over combinations of meta-strategies resulting from different random seeds. Each empirical game captures both self-play and cross-play factors across seeds. These empirical games provide the basis for constructing a sampling distribution, using bootstrapping, over a variety of game analysis statistics. We use this approach to evaluate state-of-the-art deep MARL algorithms on a class of negotiation games. From statistics on individual payoffs, social welfare, and empirical best-response graphs, we uncover strategic relationships among self-play, population-based, model-free, and model-based MARL methods.We also investigate the effect of run-time search as a meta-strategy operator, and find via meta-game analysis that the search version of a meta-strategy generally leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>MF-OML: Online Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning with Occupation Measures for Large Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning for multi-agent games has attracted lots of attention recently. However, given the challenge of solving Nash equilibria for large population games, existing works with guaranteed polynomial complexities either focus on variants of zero-sum and potential games, or aim at solving (coarse) correlated equilibria, or require access to simulators, or rely on certain assumptions that are hard to verify. This work proposes MF-OML (Mean-Field Occupation-Measure Learning), an online mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of large population sequential symmetric games. MF-OML is the first fully polynomial multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for provably solving Nash equilibria (up to mean-field approximation gaps that vanish as the number of players $N$ goes to infinity) beyond variants of zero-sum and potential games. When evaluated by the cumulative deviation from Nash equilibria, the algorithm is shown to achieve a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{3/4}+N^{-1/2}M)$ for games with the strong Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, and a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{11/12}+N^{- 1/6}M)$ for games with only the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, where $M$ is the total number of episodes and $N$ is the number of agents of the game. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first tractable globally convergent computational algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of monotone mean-field games.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Social Networking: Where People have Agency over their Personal Information and Social Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering an architecture for social networking in which people have agency over their personal information and social graph is an open challenge. Here we present a grassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social networks termed Grassroots Social Networking that aims to address this challenge. The architecture is geared for people with networked smartphones -- roaming (address-changing) computing devices communicating over an unreliable network (e.g., using UDP). The architecture incorporates (i) a decentralized social graph, where each person controls, maintains and stores only their local neighborhood in the graph; (iii) personal feeds, with authors and followers who create and store the feeds; and (ii) a grassroots dissemination protocol, in which communication among people occurs only along the edges of their social graph. The architecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a partially-ordered conflict-free counterpart of the totally-ordered conflict-based blockchain. We provide two example Grassroots Social Networking protocols -- Twitter-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their security (safety, liveness and privacy), spam/bot/deep-fake resistance, and implementation, demonstrating how server-based social networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safety-Critical Control for Networked Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern systems become ever more connected with complex dynamic coupling relationships, the development of safe control methods for such networked systems becomes paramount. In this paper, we define a general networked model with coupled dynamics and local control and discuss the relationship of node-level safety definitions for individual agents with local neighborhood dynamics. We define a node-level barrier function (NBF), node-level control barrier function (NCBF), and collaborative node-level barrier function (cNCBF) and provide conditions under which sets defined by these functions will be forward invariant. We use collaborative node-level barrier functions to construct a novel distributed algorithm for the safe control of collaborating network agents and provide conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a viable set of safe control actions for all agents or a terminally infeasible state for at least one agent. We introduce the notion of non-compliance of network neighbors as a metric of robustness for collaborative safety for a given network state and chosen barrier function hyper-parameters. We illustrate these results on a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.</description>
