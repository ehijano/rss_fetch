      <title>Dissipative Forces in Photon-Medium Interactions Using Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines dissipative forces in photon-medium interactions through time-independent perturbation theory, with a specific focus on single Helium-4 atoms. Utilizing a Hamiltonian framework, energy corrections induced by dissipative gravitational frictional effects in low-density systems are derived and analyzed as a function of inter-atomic distance. The calculations reveal an energy correction peak at $r_1 = 0.1 nm$, followed by rapid exponential decay, highlighting the dominance of nonlinear dissipative effects at nanoscale separations. These findings emphasize the critical role of short-range interactions, governed by the de-Broglie wavelength of Helium-4, and provide a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding photon-medium interactions at quantum scales. This novel single-particle approach departs from macroscopic mean-field models, offering unique insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying energy dissipation. The results have potential implications for advancing quantum information processing, nonlinear optics, and the study of dissipative mechanisms in quantum fluids. Experimental validation of the theoretical predictions is proposed using state-of-the-art techniques in optical media, levitated nanoparticle systems, and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton--environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain and handles arbitrary exciton--environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with the solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton--environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by the analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>
