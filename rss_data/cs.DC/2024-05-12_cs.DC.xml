      <title>Knowledge Connectivity Requirements for Solving BFT Consensus with Unknown Participants and Fault Threshold (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus stands as a fundamental building block for constructing reliable and fault-tolerant distributed services. The increasing demand for high-performance and scalable blockchain protocols has brought attention to solving consensus in scenarios where each participant joins the system knowing only a subset of participants. In such scenarios, the participants' initial knowledge about the existence of other participants can collectively be represented by a directed graph known as knowledge connectivity graph. The Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus with Unknown Participants (BFT-CUP) problem aims to solve consensus in those scenarios by identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions that the knowledge connectivity graphs must satisfy when a fault threshold is provided to all participants. This work extends BFT-CUP by eliminating the requirement to provide the fault threshold to the participants. We indeed address the problem of solving BFT consensus in settings where each participant initially knows a subset of participants, and although a fault threshold exists, no participant is provided with this information -- referred to as BFT Consensus with Unknown Participants and Fault Threshold (BFT-CUPFT). With this aim, we first demonstrate that the conditions for knowledge connectivity graphs identified by BFT-CUP are insufficient to solve BFT-CUPFT. Accordingly, we introduce a new type of knowledge connectivity graphs by determining the necessary and sufficient conditions they must satisfy to solve BFT-CUPFT. Furthermore, we design a protocol for solving BFT-CUPFT.</description>

      <title>Zero-consistency root emulation for unprivileged container image build</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do Linux distribution package managers need the privileged operations they request to actually happen? Apparently not, at least for building container images for HPC applications. We use this observation to implement a root emulation mode using a Linux seccomp filter that intercepts some privileged system calls, does nothing, and returns success to the calling program. This approach provides no consistency whatsoever but appears sufficient to build all Dockerfiles we examined, simplifying fully-unprivileged workflows needed for HPC application containers.</description>

      <title>Deferred Objects to Enhance Smart Contract Programming with Optimistic Parallel Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main bottlenecks of blockchains is smart contract execution. To increase throughput, modern blockchains try to execute transactions in parallel. Unfortunately, however, common blockchain use cases introduce read-write conflicts between transactions, forcing sequentiality.
  We propose RapidLane, an extension for parallel execution engines that allows the engine to capture computations in conflicting parts of transactions and defer their execution until a later time, sometimes optimistically predicting execution results. This technique, coupled with support for a new construct for smart contract languages, allows one to turn certain sequential workloads into parallelizable ones.
  We integrated RapidLane into Block-STM, a state-of-the-art parallel execution engine used by several blockchains in production, and deployed it on the Aptos blockchain. Our evaluation shows that on commonly contended workloads, such as peer-to-peer transfers with a single fee payer and NFT minting, RapidLane yields up to $12\times$ more throughput.</description>

      <title>Advancing Anomaly Detection in Computational Workflows with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational workflow, also known as workflow, consists of tasks that are executed in a certain order to attain a specific computational campaign. Computational workflows are commonly employed in science domains, such as physics, chemistry, genomics, to complete large-scale experiments in distributed and heterogeneous computing environments. However, running computations at such a large scale makes the workflow applications prone to failures and performance degradation, which can slowdown, stall, and ultimately lead to workflow failure. Learning how these workflows behave under normal and anomalous conditions can help us identify the causes of degraded performance and subsequently trigger appropriate actions to resolve them. However, learning in such circumstances is a challenging task because of the large volume of high-quality historical data needed to train accurate and reliable models. Generating such datasets not only takes a lot of time and effort but it also requires a lot of resources to be devoted to data generation for training purposes. Active learning is a promising approach to this problem. It is an approach where the data is generated as required by the machine learning model and thus it can potentially reduce the training data needed to derive accurate models. In this work, we present an active learning approach that is supported by an experimental framework, Poseidon-X, that utilizes a modern workflow management system and two cloud testbeds. We evaluate our approach using three computational workflows. For one workflow we run an end-to-end live active learning experiment, for the other two we evaluate our active learning algorithms using pre-captured data traces provided by the Flow-Bench benchmark. Our findings indicate that active learning not only saves resources, but it also improves the accuracy of the detection of anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As organisations move away from locally hosted computer services toward Cloud platforms, there is a corresponding need to ensure the forensic integrity of such instances. The primary reasons for concern are (i) the locus of responsibility, and (ii) the associated risk of legal sanction and financial penalty. Building upon previously proposed techniques for intrusion monitoring, we highlight the multi-level interpretation problem, propose enhanced monitoring of Cloud-based systems at diverse operational and data storage level as a basis for review of historical change across the hosted system and afford scope to identify any data impact from hostile action or 'friendly fire'.</description>

      <title>Optimal Uniform Circle Formation by Asynchronous Luminous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the {\sc Uniform Circle Formation} ({\sc UCF}) problem for a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots operating in \emph{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) cycles on the Euclidean plane. We assume our robots are \emph{luminous}, i.e. embedded with a persistent light that can assume a color chosen from a fixed palette, and \emph{opaque}, i.e. not able to see beyond a collinear robot. Robots are said to \emph{collide} if they share positions or their paths intersect within concurrent LCM cycles. To solve {\sc UCF}, a swarm of $n$ robots must autonomously arrange themselves so that each robot occupies a vertex of the same regular $n$-gon not fixed in advance. In terms of efficiency, the goal is to design an algorithm that optimizes (or provides a tradeoff between) two fundamental performance metrics: \emph{(i)} the execution time and \emph{(ii)} the size of the color palette. There exists an $O(1)$-time $O(1)$-color algorithm for this problem under the fully synchronous and semi-synchronous schedulers and a $O(\log\log n)$-time $O(1)$-color or $O(1)$-time $O(\sqrt{n})$-color algorithm under the asynchronous scheduler, avoiding collisions. In this paper, we develop a deterministic algorithm solving {\sc UCF} avoiding collisions in $O(1)$-time with $O(1)$ colors under the asynchronous scheduler, which is asymptotically optimal with respect to both time and number of colors used, the first such result. Furthermore, the algorithm proposed here minimizes for the first time what we call the \emph{computational SEC}, i.e. the smallest circular area where robots operate throughout the whole algorithm.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Many-Row Activation in Off-the-Shelf DRAM Chips: Experimental Characterization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally analyze the computational capability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips and the robustness of these capabilities under various timing delays between DRAM commands, data patterns, temperature, and voltage levels. We extensively characterize 120 COTS DDR4 chips from two major manufacturers. We highlight four key results of our study. First, COTS DRAM chips are capable of 1) simultaneously activating up to 32 rows (i.e., simultaneous many-row activation), 2) executing a majority of X (MAJX) operation where X&gt;3 (i.e., MAJ5, MAJ7, and MAJ9 operations), and 3) copying a DRAM row (concurrently) to up to 31 other DRAM rows, which we call Multi-RowCopy. Second, storing multiple copies of MAJX's input operands on all simultaneously activated rows drastically increases the success rate (i.e., the percentage of DRAM cells that correctly perform the computation) of the MAJX operation. For example, MAJ3 with 32-row activation (i.e., replicating each MAJ3's input operands 10 times) has a 30.81% higher average success rate than MAJ3 with 4-row activation (i.e., no replication). Third, data pattern affects the success rate of MAJX and Multi-RowCopy operations by 11.52% and 0.07% on average. Fourth, simultaneous many-row activation, MAJX, and Multi-RowCopy operations are highly resilient to temperature and voltage changes, with small success rate variations of at most 2.13% among all tested operations. We believe these empirical results demonstrate the promising potential of using DRAM as a computation substrate. To aid future research and development, we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-DRAM.</description>

      <title>A trustless society? A political look at the blockchain vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lot of business and research effort currently deals with the so called decentralised ledger technology blockchain. Putting it to use carries the tempting promise to make the intermediaries of social interactions superfluous and furthermore keep secure track of all interactions. Currently intermediaries such as banks and notaries are necessary and must be trusted, which creates great dependencies, as the financial crisis of 2008 painfully demonstrated. Especially banks and notaries are said to become dispensable as a result of using the blockchain. But in real-world applications of the blockchain, the power of central actors does not dissolve, it only shifts to new, democratically illegitimate, uncontrolled or even uncontrollable power centers. As interesting as the blockchain technically is, it doesn't efficiently solve any real-world problem and is no substitute for traditional political processes or democratic regulation of power. Research efforts investigating the blockchain should be halted.</description>

      <title>FedGCS: A Generative Framework for Efficient Client Selection in Federated Learning via Gradient-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning faces significant challenges in statistical and system heterogeneity, along with high energy consumption, necessitating efficient client selection strategies. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and learning-based methods, fall short of addressing these complexities holistically. In response, we propose FedGCS, a novel generative client selection framework that innovatively recasts the client selection process as a generative task. Drawing inspiration from the methodologies used in large language models, FedGCS efficiently encodes abundant decision-making knowledge within a continuous representation space, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization to search for optimal client selection that will be finally output via generation. The framework comprises four steps: (1) automatic collection of diverse "selection-score" pair data using classical client selection methods; (2) training an encoder-evaluator-decoder framework on this data to construct a continuous representation space; (3) employing gradient-based optimization in this space for optimal client selection; (4) generating the final optimal client selection via using beam search for the well-trained decoder. FedGCS outperforms traditional methods by being more comprehensive, generalizable, and efficient, simultaneously optimizing for model performance, latency, and energy consumption. The effectiveness of FedGCS is proven through extensive experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>DP-DyLoRA: Fine-Tuning Transformer-Based Models On-Device under Differentially Private Federated Learning using Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows clients in an Internet of Things (IoT) system to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a server. However, clients' contributions to the server can still leak sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) addresses such leakage by providing formal privacy guarantees, with mechanisms that add randomness to the clients' contributions. The randomness makes it infeasible to train large transformer-based models, common in modern IoT systems. In this work, we empirically evaluate the practicality of fine-tuning large scale on-device transformer-based models with differential privacy in a federated learning system. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system properties for tasks spanning a multitude of domains: speech recognition, computer vision (CV) and natural language understanding (NLU). Our results show that full fine-tuning under differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) generally leads to huge performance degradation which can be alleviated by reducing the dimensionality of contributions through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our benchmarks of existing DP-PEFT methods show that DP-Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) consistently outperforms other methods. An even more promising approach, DyLoRA, which makes the low rank variable, when naively combined with FL would straightforwardly break differential privacy. We therefore propose an adaptation method that can be combined with differential privacy and call it DP-DyLoRA. Finally, we are able to reduce the accuracy degradation and word error rate (WER) increase due to DP to less than 2% and 7% respectively with 1 million clients and a stringent privacy budget of {\epsilon}=2.</description>

      <title>A Note on an Inferentialist Approach to Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central concept within informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a 'resource semantics' of the logic. This paper shows how 'inferentialism' -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's practical, high performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols operate in the partial synchrony model. However, existing protocols are inefficient when deployments are indeed partially synchronous. They deliver either low latency during fault-free, synchronous periods (good intervals) or robust recovery from events that interrupt progress (blips). At one end, traditional, view-based BFT protocols optimize for latency during good intervals, but, when blips occur, can suffer from performance degradation (hangovers) that can last beyond the return of a good interval. At the other end, modern DAG-based BFT protocols recover more gracefully from blips, but exhibit lackluster latency during good intervals. To close the gap, this work presents Motorway, a novel high-throughput BFT protocol that offers both low latency and seamless recovery from blips. By combining a highly parallel asynchronous data dissemination layer with a low-latency, partially synchronous consensus mechanism, Motorway (i) avoids the hangovers incurred by traditional BFT protocols and (ii) matches the throughput of state of the art DAG-based BFT protocols while cutting their latency in half, matching the latency of traditional BFT protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When developing a software system, a change in one part of the system may lead to unwanted changes in other parts of the system. These affected parts may interfere with system performance, so regression testing is used to deal with these disorders. This test seeks to re-measure these sections to prevent these abnormalities, but it is difficult to identify these sections for re-examination. We try to cluster the changes of our software system based on the system functions by singular value decomposition, to be able to use to identify these parts during a new change, to perform the test again. In order to increase speedup, our calculations were performed in parallel on shared memory systems so that by increasing the scale of software systems, an optimal answer could be obtained.</description>

      <title>HeteroSwitch: Characterizing and Taming System-Induced Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a practical approach to train deep learning models collaboratively across user-end devices, protecting user privacy by retaining raw data on-device. In FL, participating user-end devices are highly fragmented in terms of hardware and software configurations. Such fragmentation introduces a new type of data heterogeneity in FL, namely \textit{system-induced data heterogeneity}, as each device generates distinct data depending on its hardware and software configurations. In this paper, we first characterize the impact of system-induced data heterogeneity on FL model performance. We collect a dataset using heterogeneous devices with variations across vendors and performance tiers. By using this dataset, we demonstrate that \textit{system-induced data heterogeneity} negatively impacts accuracy, and deteriorates fairness and domain generalization problems in FL. To address these challenges, we propose HeteroSwitch, which adaptively adopts generalization techniques (i.e., ISP transformation and SWAD) depending on the level of bias caused by varying HW and SW configurations. In our evaluation with a realistic FL dataset (FLAIR), HeteroSwitch reduces the variance of averaged precision by 6.3\% across device types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety guarantees and security-latency problem of Nakamoto consensus have been extensively studied in the last decade with a bounded delay model. Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results.</description>
