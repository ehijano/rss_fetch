      <title>Local topology and perestroikas in protein structure and folding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods of local topology are introduced to the field of protein physics. This is achieved by explaining how the folding and unfolding processes of a globular protein alter the local topology of the protein's C-alpha backbone through conformational bifurcations. The mathematical formulation builds on the concept of Arnol'd's perestroikas, by extending it to piecewise linear chains using the discrete Frenet frame formalism. In the low-temperature folded phase, the backbone geometry generalizes the concept of a Peano curve, with its modular building blocks modeled by soliton solutions of a discretized nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The onset of thermal unfolding begins when perestroikas change the flattening and branch points that determine the centers of solitons. When temperature increases, the perestroikas cascade, which leads to a progressive disintegration of the modular structures. The folding and unfolding processes are quantitatively characterized by a correlation function that describes the evolution of perestroikas under temperature changes. The approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the Physics of protein folding and unfolding transitions, contributing to the broader field of protein structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Highly Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescent Fiber Matrixes for Oxygen Sensing with Micrometer-Spatial Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen (O2)-sensing matrices are promising tools for the live monitoring of extracellular O2 consumption levels in long-term cell cultures. In this study, ratiometric O2-sensing membranes were prepared by electrospinning, an easy, low-cost, scalable, and robust method for fabricating nanofibers. Poly({\epsilon}-caprolactone) and poly(dimethyl)siloxane polymers were blended with tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium(II) dichloride, which was used as the O2-sensing probe, and rhodamine B isothiocyanate, which was used as the reference dye. The functionalized scaffolds were morphologically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and their physicochemical profiles were obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and water contact angle measurement. The sensing capabilities were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, performing photobleaching, reversibility, and calibration curve studies toward different dissolved O2 (DO) concentrations. Electrospun sensing nanofibers showed a high response to changes in DO concentrations in the physiological-pathological range from 0.5 to 20% and good stability under ratiometric imaging. In addition, the sensing systems were highly biocompatible for cell growth promoting adhesiveness and growth of three cancer cell lines, namely metastatic melanoma cell line SK-MEL2, breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line Panc-1, thus recreating a suitable biological environment in vitro. These O2-sensing biomaterials can potentially measure alterations in cell metabolism caused by changes in ambient O2 content during drug testing/validation and tissue regeneration processes.</description>

      <title>Combined topological and spatial constraints are required to capture the structure of neural connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric brain reconstructions provide an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the complex connectivity patterns of neurons in an increasing number of organisms. Here, we model and quantify the complexity of the resulting neural connectomes in the fruit fly, mouse, and human and unveil a simple set of shared organizing principles across these organisms. To put the connectomes in a physical context, we also construct contactomes, the network of neurons in physical contact in each organism. With these, we establish that physical constraints -- either given by pairwise distances or the contactome -- play a crucial role in shaping the network structure. For example, neuron positions are highly optimal in terms of distance from their neighbors. However, spatial constraints alone cannot capture the network topology, including the broad degree distribution. Conversely, the degree sequence alone is insufficient to recover the spatial structure. We resolve this apparent conflict by formulating scalable maximum entropy models, incorporating both types of constraints. The resulting generative models have predictive power beyond the input data, as they capture several additional biological and network characteristics, like synaptic weights and graphlet statistics.</description>

      <title>Atomic Quantum Technologies for Quantum Matter and Fundamental Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.</description>
