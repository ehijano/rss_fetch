      <title>Regional Control Strategies for a Spatiotemporal SQEIAR Epidemic Model: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we look for a spacial SEIAR-type epidemic model consediring quarantined population $(Q)$, namely SQEIAR model. The dynamic of the SQEIAR model involves six partial differential equations that decribe the changes in susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected and recovered population. Our goal is to reduce the number of exposed, asymptomatic, and infected population while taking into account the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. Then, we implement a new strategy based on two control actions: regional quarantine for susceptible population and treatment for infected population. To demonstrate the practical utility of the obtained results, a numerical example centered on COVID-19 is presented.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of Fourier mass of passively advected scalars in the Batchelor regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1959, Batchelor gave a prediction for the power spectral density of a passive scalar advected by an incompressible fluid exhibiting shear-straining, a mechanism for the creation of small scales in the scalar [Bat59]. Recently, a `cumulative' version of this law, summing over Fourier modes below a given wavenumber $N$, was given for a broad class of passive scalars under incompressible advection, including by solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations [BBPS22c].
  This paper addresses to what extent Fourier mass of such passive scalars truly saturates the predicted power law scaling due to Batchelor. Via discrete-time pulsed-diffusion models of the advection-reaction equations, we exhibit situations compatible with the cumulative law but for which the distribution of Fourier mass among wavenumbers $|k| \leq N$ is relatively \emph{sparse} and much smaller than a `mode-wise' version of Batchelor's original prediction. In the same situations we also establish an `exponential radial shell' version of Batchelor's laws via a novel application of the method of spectral distributions.</description>

      <title>What is the graph of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations.
  We define two types of graphs: what we call a ``trajectory graph'' and a ``Morse graph'', which adds subtleties. Each node of a trajectory graph is a limit set of a trajectory, and there is an edge between two nodes if, for every $\eps&gt;0$, there is a trajectory passing within $\eps$ from both nodes. In particular, there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Morse graphs are more varied, and the literature has several definitions of graphs of this type. We show the various standard definitions of Morse graphs produce the same graphs provided there are at most countably many nodes and other mild hypotheses.
  Our initial goal was to prove that, under mild hypotheses, every graph is a connected graph, and we prove that.</description>

      <title>Localized patterns in the Gierer Meinhardt model on a cycle graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of the spike solutions and their stability for theGierer-Meinhardt model on discrete lattices. We explore several phenomena that have no analogues in the continuum limit. For example in the discrete case, the system retains spike patterns even when diffusion of the activator is set to zero. In this limit, we derive a simplified algebraic system to determine the presence of a K-spike solution. The stability of this solution is determined by a K by K matrix. We further delve into the scenarios where K = 2 and K = 3, revealing the existence of stable asymmetric spike patterns. Our stability analysis indicates that the symmetric two-spike solution is the most robust. Furthermore, we demonstrate that symmetric K-spike solutions are locally the most stable configurations. Additionally, we explore spike solutions under conditions where the inhibitor's diffusion rate is not significantly large. In doing so, we uncover zigzag and mesa patterns that do not occur in the continuous system. Our findings reveal that the discrete lattices support a greater variety of stable patterns for the Gierer-Meinhardt model.</description>

      <title>Sensitivities in complex-time flows: phase transitions, Hamiltonian structure and differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reminiscent of physical phase transitions separatrices divide the phase space of dynamical systems with multiple equilibria into regions of distinct flow behavior and asymptotics. We introduce complex time in order to study corresponding Riemann surface solutions of holomorphic and meromorphic flows, explicitly solve their sensitivity differential equation and identify a related Hamiltonian structure and an associated geometry in order to study separatrix properties. As an application we analyze complex-time Newton flow of Riemann's $\xi$-function on the basis of a compactly convergent polynomial approximation of its Riemann surface solution defined as zero set of polynomials, e.g. algebraic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ (in the complex projective plane respectively), that is closely related to a complex-valued Hamiltonian system. Its geometric properties might contain information on the global separatrix structure and the root location of $\xi$ and $\xi'$.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for aggregation kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel physics-informed approach for accurately modeling aggregation kinetics which provides a comprehensive solution in a single run by outputting all model parameters simultaneously, a clear advancement over traditional single-output networks that require multiple executions. This method effectively captures the density distributions of both large and small clusters, showcasing a notable improvement in predicting small particles, which have historically posed challenges in computational models. This approach yields significant advancements in computational efficiency and accuracy for solving the Smoluchowski equations by minimizing the interval over which the physics-informed loss function operates, allowing for efficient computation over extended time-frames with minimal increase in computational cost. Due to the the independence of predefined shapes for bias or weight outputs, it removes the dependency on prior assumptions about output structures. Furthermore, our physics-informed framework exhibits high compatibility with the generalized Brownian kernel, maintaining robust accuracy for this previously unaddressed kernel type. The framework's notable novelty also lies in addressing four different kernels with one neural network architecture. Therefore with high computational efficiency, combined with low error margins it indicates significant potential for long-term predictions and integration into broader computational systems.</description>

      <title>Finite and infinite degree Thurston maps with extra marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the family of marked Thurston maps that are defined everywhere on the topological sphere $S^2$, potentially excluding at most countable closed set of essential singularities. We show that when an unmarked Thurston map $f$ is realized by a postsingularly finite holomorphic map, the marked Thurston map $(f, A)$, where $A \subset S^2$ is the corresponding finite marked set, admits such a realization if and only if it has no degenerate Levy cycle. To obtain this result, we analyze the associated pullback map $\sigma_{f, A}$ defined on the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_A$ and demonstrate that some of its iterates admit well-behaved invariant complex sub-manifolds within $\mathcal{T}_A$. By applying powerful machinery of one-dimensional complex dynamics and hyperbolic geometry, we gain a clear understanding of the behavior of the map $\sigma_{f, A}$ restricted to the corresponding invariant subset of the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_A$.</description>

      <title>Dense periodic optimization for countable Markov shift via Aubry points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For transitive Markov subshifts over countable alphabets, this note ensures that a dense subclass of locally H\"older continuous potentials admits at most a single periodic probability as a maximizing measure with compact support. We resort to concepts analogous to those introduced by Mather and Ma\~n\'e in the study of globally minimizing curves in Lagrangian dynamics. In particular, given a summable variation potential, we show the existence of a continuous sub-action in the presence of an Aubry point.</description>

      <title>Anosov flows in dimension 3: an outside look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes were intended as support material for a minicourse on Anosov flows in the conference "Symplectic geometry and Anosov flows'' which took place in Heidelberg in July 2024 organized by Peter Albers, Jonathan Bowden and Agust\'in Moreno. I took the invitation to present the subject as asking from an outsider view of the subject, given the fact that my research uses both ideas and results from the theory of Anosov flows. The point of view of the course is to provide an overview of the main results and questions in the subject, with emphasis on the interaction with topology, geometry, specially symplectic geometry and contact aspects of the theory. Some detail is given in the presentation of the Barbot-Fenley theory of leaf spaces. Hopefully the notes will contribute in gaining a working knowledge of the theory and its many beautiful connections.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic Flows on Finite Semigroups: Foundations and First Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of flows was used as a crucial tool in the recent proof by Margolis, Rhodes and Schilling that Krohn-Rhodes complexity is decidable. In this paper we begin a systematic study of aperiodic flows. We give the foundations of the theory of flows and give a unified approach to the Presentation Lemma and its relations to flows and the Slice Theorem. We completely describe semigroups having a flow over the trivial semigroup and connect this to classical results in inverse semigroup theory. We reinterpret Tilson's Theorem on the complexity of small monoids in terms of flows. We conclude with examples of semigroups built from the character table of Abelian Groups that have an aperiodic flows.</description>

      <title>Improved deep learning of chaotic dynamical systems with multistep penalty losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems remains a formidable challenge due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and the inherent limitations of traditional data-driven modeling approaches. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging the recently proposed multi-step penalty (MP) optimization technique. Our approach extends the applicability of MP optimization to a wide range of deep learning architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators and UNETs. By introducing penalized local discontinuities in the forecast trajectory, we effectively handle the non-convexity of loss landscapes commonly encountered in training neural networks for chaotic systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through its application to two challenging use-cases: the prediction of flow velocity evolution in two-dimensional turbulence and ocean dynamics using reanalysis data. Our results highlight the potential of this approach for accurate and stable long-term prediction of chaotic dynamics, paving the way for new advancements in data-driven modeling of complex natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any two minimal models of an lc algebraically integrable foliated triple on potentially klt varieties, there exist small birational models that are connected by a sequence of flops. In particular, any two minimal models of lc algebraically integrable foliated triples on $\mathbb Q$-factorial klt varieties are connected by a sequence of flops. We also discuss the connection between minimal models for possibly non-algebraically integrable foliations on threefolds, assuming the minimal model program for generalized foliated quadruples.</description>

      <title>Diagonal comparison of ample C*-diagonals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce diagonal comparison, a regularity property of diagonal pairs where the sub-C*-algebra has totally disconnected spectrum, and establish its equivalence with the concurrence of strict comparison of the ambient C*-algebra and dynamical comparison of the underlying dynamics induced by the partial action of the normalisers. As an application, we show that for diagonal pairs arising from principal minimal transformation groupoids with totally disconnected unit space, diagonal comparison is equivalent to tracial Z-stability of the pair and that it is implied by finite diagonal dimension.
  In-between, we show that any projection of the diagonal sub-C*-algebra can be uniformly tracially divided, and explore a property of conditional expectations onto abelian sub-C*-algebras, namely containment of every positive element in the hereditary subalgebra generated by its conditional expectation. We show that the expectation associated to a C*-pair with finite diagonal dimension is always hereditary in that sense, and we give an example where this property does not occur.</description>

      <title>Characterization of input-to-output stability for infinite dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a superposition theorem for input-to-output stability (IOS) of a broad class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems with outputs including both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems from [1] and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations from [2]. To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output-Lagrange stability property (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from [1] and [2] to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.</description>

      <title>Smoothing countable group actions on metrizable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every topological action of a countable group on a metrizable space can be realized as a bi-Lipschitz action with respect to some compatible metric. This extends a result due to U. Hamenst\"{a}dt regarding finitely generated groups, and our proof is based upon her idea. This also gives a simple proof of a theorem due to Deroin, Kleptsyn and Navas regrading one-manifolds. We also establish an analogous result for closed subgroups of locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of simulation relations for symbolic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction-based control design is a promising approach for ensuring safety-critical control of complex cyber-physical systems. A key aspect of this methodology is the relation between the original and abstract systems, which ensures that the abstract controller can be transformed into a valid controller for the original system through a concretization procedure. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and systematic framework that characterizes various simulation relations, through their associated concretization procedures. We introduce the concept of augmented system, which universally enables a feedback refinement relation with the abstract system. This augmented system encapsulates the specific characteristics of each simulation relation within an interface, enabling a plug-and-play control architecture. Our results demonstrate that the existence of a particular simulation relation between the concrete and abstract systems is equivalent to the implementability of a specific control architecture, which depends on the considered simulation relation. This allows us to introduce new types of relations, and to establish the advantages and drawbacks of different relations, which we exhibit through detailed examples.</description>

      <title>On the Melnikov method for fractional-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to clarifying and introducing the correct application of Melnikov method in fractional dynamics. Attention to the complex dynamics of hyperbolic orbits and to fractional calculus can be, respectively, traced back to Poincar\'es attack on the three-body problem a century ago and to the early days of calculus three centuries ago. Nowadays, fractional calculus has been widely applied in modeling dynamic problems across various fields due to its advantages in describing problems with non-locality. Some of these models have also been confirmed to exhibit hyperbolic orbit dynamics, and recently, they have been extensively studied based on Melnikov method, an analytical approach for homoclinic and heteroclinic orbit dynamics. Despite its decade-long application in fractional dynamics, there is a universal problem in these applications that remains to be clarified, i.e., defining fractional-order systems within finite memory boundaries leads to the neglect of perturbation calculation for parts of the stable and unstable manifolds in Melnikov analysis. After clarifying and redefining the problem, a rigorous analytical case is provided for reference. Unlike existing results, the Melnikov criterion here is derived in a globally closed form, which was previously considered unobtainable due to difficulties in the analysis of fractional-order perturbations characterized by convolution integrals with power-law type singular kernels. Finally, numerical methods are employed to verify the derived Melnikov criterion. Overall, the clarification for the problem and the presented case are expected to provide insights for future research in this topic.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the study of a linear model arising in thermoelastic rod of homogeneous material. The system is resulting from a coupling of a heat and a wave equation in the interval $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions at the outer endpoints where the parabolic component is degenerating at the end point $x=0$. Two models are considered the first is with weak degeneracy and the second is with strong degeneracy. We aim to study the well-posedness and asymptotic stability of both systems using techniques from the $C_{0}$-semigroup theory and a use a frequency domain approach based on the well-known result of Pr\"uss in order to prove using some multiplier techniques that the energy of classical solutions decays uniformly as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>A Random-Walk Concentration Principle for Occupancy Processes on Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns discrete-time occupancy processes on a finite graph. Our results can be formulated in two theorems, which are stated for vertex processes, but also applied to edge process (e.g., dynamic random graphs). The first theorem shows that concentration of local state averages is controlled by a random walk on the graph. The second theorem concerns concentration of polynomials of the vertex states. For dynamic random graphs, this allows to estimate deviations of edge density, triangle density, and more general subgraph densities. Our results only require Lipschitz continuity and hold for both dense and sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic metastability in the self-attention model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the self-attention model - an interacting particle system on the unit sphere, which serves as a toy model for Transformers, the deep neural network architecture behind the recent successes of large language models. We prove the appearance of dynamic metastability conjectured in [GLPR23] - although particles collapse to a single cluster in infinite time, they remain trapped near a configuration of several clusters for an exponentially long period of time. By leveraging a gradient flow interpretation of the system, we also connect our result to an overarching framework of slow motion of gradient flows proposed by Otto and Reznikoff [OR07] in the context of coarsening and the Allen-Cahn equation. We finally probe the dynamics beyond the exponentially long period of metastability, and illustrate that, under an appropriate time-rescaling, the energy reaches its global maximum in finite time and has a staircase profile, with trajectories manifesting saddle-to-saddle-like behavior, reminiscent of recent works in the analysis of training dynamics via gradient descent for two-layer neural networks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a broad class of equations that are described by a graph, which includes many well-studied systems. For these, we show that the number of solutions (or the dimension of the solution set) can be bounded by studying certain induced subgraphs. As corollaries, we obtain novel bounds in spectral graph theory on the multiplicities of graph eigenvalues, and in nonlinear dynamical system on the dimension of the equilibrium set of a network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the minimum energy estimator for a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation. The Mortensen observer - originally introduced for the energy-optimal reconstruction of the state of nonlinear finite-dimensional systems - is formulated for a disturbed cubic wave equation and the associated observer equation is derived. An in depth study of the associated optimal control problem and sensitivity analysis of the corresponding value function reveals that the energy optimal state estimator is well-defined. Deploying a classical fixed point argument we proceed to show that the observer equation is locally well-posed.</description>

Abstract: We explore the triangle outer billiards map in points at infinity in the hyperbolic plane, focusing on the rotation number. Building on Dogru and Tabachnikov's work, which established the conditions for triangles where the rotation number of the billiard map is $1/3$, we examine cases where the rotation number is $2/5$. We provide a sufficient condition for this rotation number and show its necessity for large isosceles triangles. The results are framed within the context of the Beltrami-Klein model. We concludes with a conjecture based on the findings.</description>

Abstract: We consider a differential inclusion on a manifold, defined by a field of open half-spaces whose boundary in each tangent space is the kernel of a one-form. We make the assumption that the corank one distribution associated to the kernel is completely nonholonomic of step 2. We identify a subset of solutions of the differential inclusion, satisfying two endpoints and periodic boundary conditions, which are homotopy equivalent in the $W^{1,p}$-topology, for any $p\in [1,+\infty)$, to the based loop space and the free loop space respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a noise-robust learning framework for the Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems, ensuring long-term stability and robustness to noise. Unlike some existing approaches that rely on ad-hoc observables or black-box neural networks in extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our framework leverages observables generated by the system dynamics through a Hankel matrix, which shares similarities with discrete Polyflow. To enhance noise robustness and ensure long-term stability, we developed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator, along with a progressive learning strategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in the phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for orientable closed Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed orientable Riemannian surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that su(2) rational and trigonometric Gaudin models, or in other words, generalised coupled angular momenta systems, have singularities that undergo Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations. In particular, we find a normal form for the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation up to sixth order, letting us determine when the bifurcation is degenerate or not. Furthermore, in the non-degenerate case we may use the fourth order terms to determine whether the bifurcation is supercritical or subcritical; whether a flap appears in the image of the momentum map or not. Finally, figures illustrating some of the bifurcations taking place in su(2) Gaudin models are presented, showing that there are more bifurcations occurring than only Hamiltonian Hopf ones.</description>

Abstract: In this follow-up paper to [Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincare-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows, Nicolas Kainz, Dirk Lebiedz (2024)] we investigate the global topology and geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x} = F(x)$ with entire vector field $F$ by exploiting and extending the local structure of finite elliptic decompositions. We prove topological properties of the basins of centers, nodes, and foci, while excluding isolated equilibria at the boundaries of the latter two. We propose a definition of global elliptic sectors and introduce the notion of a sector-forming orbit allowing global topological analysis. The structure of heteroclinic regions between two equilibria is characterized.</description>

      <title>On the long-time statistical behavior of smooth solutions of the weakly damped, stochastically-driven KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the damped periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of a white-in-time and spatially smooth stochastic source term and studies the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the integrals of motion for KdV can be exploited to prove regularity and ergodic properties of invariant measures for damped stochastic KdV. First, by considering non-trivial modifications of the integrals of motion, we establish Lyapunov structure by proving that moments of Sobolev norms of solutions at all orders of regularity are bounded globally-in-time; existence of invariant measures follows as an immediate consequence. Next, we prove a weak Foias-Prodi type estimate for damped stochastic KdV, for which the synchronization occurs in expected value. This estimate plays a crucial role throughout our subsequent analysis. As a first novel application, we combine the Foias-Prodi estimate with the Lyapunov structure to establish that invariant measures are supported on smooth functions provided that the external driving forces are smooth. We then establish ergodic properties of invariant measures, treating the regimes of arbitrary damping and large damping separately. For arbitrary damping, we demonstrate that the framework of `asymptotic coupling' can be implemented for a compact proof of uniqueness of the invariant measure provided that sufficiently many directions in phase space are stochastically forced. Our proof is paradigmatic for SPDEs for which a weak Foias-Prodi type property holds. Lastly, for large damping, we establish the existence of a spectral gap with respect to a Wasserstein-like distance, and exponential mixing and uniqueness of the invariant measure follows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results concerning the existence of surfaces of section for the geodesic flows of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces. The surfaces of section $\Sigma$ that we construct are either Birkhoff sections, meaning that they intersect every sufficiently long orbit segment of the geodesic flow, or at least they have some hyperbolic components in $\partial\Sigma$ as limit sets of the orbits of the geodesic flow that do not return to $\Sigma$. In order to prove these theorems, we provide a study of configurations of simple closed geodesics of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces, which may have independent interest.

      <title>Spectral invariants over the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral invariants are quantitative measurements in symplectic topology coming from Floer homology theory. We study their dependence on the choice of coefficients in the context of Hamiltonian Floer homology. We discover phenomena in this setting which hold for $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients and fail for all field coefficients. For example, we prove that the spectral norm, an important metric derived from spectral invariants, is unbounded over $\mathbb{Z}$ for complex projective spaces, while it is uniformly bounded over all fields. This allows us to answer a symplectic version of a question of Hingston, originally asked in the setting of the energy functional on the loop space. We also provide applications to Hamiltonian dynamics and Hofer's geometry.</description>

      <title>From habitat decline to collapse: a spatially explicit approach connecting habitat degradation to destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Habitat loss, driven primarily by anthropogenic activity, significantly threatens ecosystem sustainability. While it is well understood that habitat loss is the leading contributor to declines in biodiversity worldwide, the connection between habitat degradation, destruction, and different locomotion strategies remains unclear. We use a reaction-diffusion framework to analyze the effects of habitat loss on population persistence and abundance. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an extinction threshold, beyond which further degradation of the environment predicts deterministic extirpation. Our results offer a robust analytical connection between habitat degradation and destruction, providing a mechanistic understanding of species persistence under varying environmental conditions and differing locomotion strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Shapes of Rational Lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rational lemniscate is a level set of $|r|$ where $r: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational. We prove that any planar Euler graph can be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate. This generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve can be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that is also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version of the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new result on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.</description>
