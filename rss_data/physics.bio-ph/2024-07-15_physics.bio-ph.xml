      <title>Directed Motion and Spatial Coherence in the Cell Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of chromatin and the factors that are affecting it, has provided valuable insights into the organization and functionality of the genome in the cell nucleus. We control the expression of Lamin-A, an important organizer protein of the chromatin and nucleus structure. By simultaneously tracking tens of chromosomal loci (telomeres) in each nucleus, we find that the motion of chromosomal loci in Lamin-A depleted cells is both faster and more directed on a scale of a few micrometers, which coincides with the size of chromosome territories. Moreover, in the absence of Lamin-A we reveal the existence of correlations among neighboring telomeres. We show how these pairwise correlations are linked with the intermittent and persistent character of telomere trajectories, underscoring the importance of Lamin-A protein in chromosomal organization.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many microorganisms are capable of swimming through viscous fluids such as water in order to search for nutrients, swim toward oxygen or light, or to escape from predators. To navigate their environment they often perform large nonreciprocal periodic deformations of their shape, by waving appendages such as cilia or flagella, or by deforming their entire body. Even unicellular organisms are fundamentally made of parts, which need to be cooperatively utilized to allow these creatures to navigate their environment, without using a centralized control mechanism. Here, we investigate the physical implications of decentralized decision-making of the actuators of a generalized N-bead Najafi Golestanian microswimmer, self-propelling via coordinated non-reciprocal swimming strokes. We treat each bead as an artificial neural network-based agent that perceives information about its neighbors and whose actions induce strokes of its adjacent arms. With neuroevolution techniques, we evolve optimal policies for the single-bead decision centers such that the N-bead collective efficiently self-propels as an individual, allowing us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies. We demonstrate that such decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and facilitate cargo transport or drug delivery applications "out of the box", without further optimization. Our approach allows us to train large swimmers ($N=100$ and more), and we show that long-wavelength solutions lead to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. Our work is of relevance to understand robust locomotion of biological microswimmers, to develop robust artificial microswimmer navigation strategies, and, in a broader conceptional context, for Artificial Life&lt; and in general emergent levels of individuality.</description>

      <title>A Primitive Model for Predicting Membrane Currents in Excitable Cells Based Only on Ion Diffusion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical models for predicting current flow in excitable cells such as axons, originally proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley, rely on empirical voltage-gating parameters that quantify ion transport across sodium and potassium ion channels. We propose a primitive model for predicting these currents based entirely on well-established ion diffusion coefficients. Changes inside the excitable cell due to the opening of a central sodium channel are confined to a growing hemisphere with a radius that is governed by the sodium ion diffusion coefficient. The sodium channel, which is open throughout the calculation, activates and deactivates naturally due to coupled electrodiffusion processes. The characteristic time of current pulses, which are in the picoampere range, increases from 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{-1}$ s as channel density is decreased from 10,000 to 1 channel per micrometer squared. Model predictions are compared with data obtained from giant squid axons without invoking any gating parameters.</description>
