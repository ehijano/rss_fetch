      <title>A comparison of stretched-grid and limited-area modelling for data-driven regional weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy, outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs. In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system.</description>

      <title>Three-step growth of vapor-deposited ice under mesospheric temperature and water vapor conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly understood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze the structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K) under vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during vapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up to 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth suggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric clouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step growth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited ice at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Generalizable neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies in idealized and global ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08900v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become popular to parameterize the effects of mesoscale eddies in ocean models. However, they perform poorly in generalization tasks and may require retuning if the grid resolution or ocean configuration changes. We address the generalization problem by enforcing physics constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data-driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling. The new parameterization improves the representation of kinetic and potential energy in online simulations with idealized and global ocean models. Comparison to baseline parameterizations and impact on global ocean biases are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards NoahMP-AI: Enhancing Land Surface Model Prediction with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture prediction during extreme events remains a critical challenge for earth system modeling, with profound implications for drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and climate adaptation strategies. While land surface models (LSMs) provide physically-based predictions, they exhibit systematic biases during extreme conditions when their parameterizations operate outside calibrated ranges. Here we present NoahMP-AI, a physics-guided deep learning framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging the complete Noah-MP land surface model as a comprehensive physics-based feature generator while using machine learning to correct structural limitations against satellite observations. We employ a 3D U-Net architecture that processes Noah-MP outputs (soil moisture, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux) to predict SMAP soil moisture across two contrasting extreme events: a prolonged drought (March-September 2022) and Hurricane Beryl (July 2024) over Texas. When comparing NoahMP-AI with NoahMP, our results demonstrate an increase in R-squared values from -0.7 to 0.5 during drought conditions, while maintaining physical consistency and spatial coherence. The framework's ability to preserve Noah-MP's physical relationships while learning observation-based corrections represents a significant advance in hybrid earth system modeling. This work establishes both a practical tool for operational forecasting and a benchmark for investigating the optimal integration of physics-based understanding with data-driven learning in environmental prediction systems.</description>

      <title>EarthLink: A Self-Evolving AI Agent for Climate Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction, continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow. Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system research in an era of accelerating global change. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.</description>
