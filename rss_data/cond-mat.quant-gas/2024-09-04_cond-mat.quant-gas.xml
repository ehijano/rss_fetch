      <title>Roadmap to vortex nucleation below critical rotation frequency in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices in a superfluid above a certain critical trap rotation frequency serves as a hallmark signature of superfluidity. Based on the beyond mean field framework, crucial for the formation of exotic supersolid and droplet states, we investigate dynamic protocols for vortex nucleation in the superfluid and supersolid states of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), at a significantly lower trap rotation frequency. We find that the critical rotation frequency of the trap varies with the dipole-dipole interaction strength and the polarization direction of the external magnetic field. Leveraging these characteristics of dipolar BECs, we demonstrate three dynamic protocols for vortex nucleation even when rotating below the critical rotation frequency viz.: (i) varying the $s$-wave scattering length, (ii) changing the polarizing angle, and (iii) successive modulation of both the scattering length and polarizing angle. These dynamic vortex seeding protocols could serve as important benchmarks for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>`Triviality' of universal relations for disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal relations for spin-$1/2$ fermions with contact interaction in the presence of quenched disorder are discussed. The disorder is modeled by a random external potential with the Gaussian distribution and $\delta$-like two-point correlation function. Utilizing simple scaling arguments, the renormalizability of the theory, and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem we identified the large-momentum tail of particle distribution and analog of Tan's energy relation for many-fermion systems with disorder in arbitrary dimension $d\ge 2$. It is shown that the energy-pressure relation manifests a kind of scale anomaly in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Correlations in interacting electron liquids: Many-body statistics and hyperuniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform many-body systems are exotic states of matter with novel optical, transport, and mechanical properties. These systems are characterized by an anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations compared to typical liquids, i.e., the structure factor obeys the scaling relation $S(k)\sim \mathcal{B}k^\alpha$ with $\mathcal{B}, \alpha&gt;0$ in the limit $k$\,$\rightarrow$\,$ 0$. Ground-state $d$-dimensional free fermionic gases, which are fundamental models for many metals and semiconductors, are key examples of \textit{quantum} disordered hyperuniform states with important connections to random matrix theory. However, the effects of electron-electron interactions as well as the polarization of the electron liquid on hyperuniformity have not been explored thus far. In this work, we systematically address these questions by deriving the analytical small-$k$ behaviors (and associatedly, $\alpha$ and $\mathcal{B}$) of the total and spin-resolved structure factors of quasi-1D, 2D, and 3D electron liquids for varying polarizations and interaction parameters. We validate that these equilibrium disordered ground states are hyperuniform, as dictated by the fluctuation-compressibility relation. Interestingly, free fermions, partially polarized interacting fermions, and fully polarized interacting fermions are characterized by different values of the small-$k$ scaling exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $\mathcal{B}$. In particular, partially polarized fermionic liquids exhibit a unique form of \textit{multihyperuniformity}, in which the net configuration exhibits a stronger form of hyperuniformity (i.e., larger $\alpha$) than each individual spin component.</description>

      <title>Non-linear steady states of subwavelength atomic arrays at low light intensities and beyond mean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays constitute a novel light-matter platform with long-range interactions and collective dissipation that can host novel non-equilibrium many-body states. Here we investigate their steady states under coherent driving. While in the low-drive intensity regime they have often been described in terms of linear, non-interacting theories, we show that such a description is inadequate in subwavelength regimes. There, we point out that non-linearities can have large effects down to a vanishing drive intensity in the limit of large number of atoms. Then we investigate the role of fluctuations beyond Gutzwiller mean-field theory within a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) approach in the regime of intermediate drive intensity. We show that these have a dramatic impact on the steady-state phase diagram, including suppressing a range of non-homogeneous instabilities and phases predicted in mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Many-body phases from effective geometrical frustration and long-range interactions in a subwavelength lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration and long-range couplings are key contributors to create quantum phases with different properties throughout physics. We propose a scheme where both ingredients naturally emerge in a Raman induced subwavelength lattice. We first demonstrate that Raman-coupled multicomponent quantum gases can realize a highly versatile frustrated Hubbard Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. The deeply subwavelength lattice period leads to strong long-range interparticle repulsion with tunable range and decay. We numerically demonstrate that the combination of frustration and long-range couplings generates many-body phases of bosons, including a range of density-wave and superfluid phases with broken translational and time reversal symmetries, respectively. Our results thus represent a powerful approach for efficiently combining long-range interactions and frustration in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Pairing transitions in a Binary Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stable Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) pairing state of a bosonic system has long been sought theoretically and experimentally. Here we study the BCS state of a binary Bose gas with $s$-wave intra-species repulsions and an inter-species attraction in the mean-field-stable region. We find that above the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) transtion temperature, there is a phase transtion from the normal state to the BCS state due to inter-species pairing. When the temperature decreases, another phase transtion from the BCS state to the mixture state with both atomic BEC and inter-species pairs occurs. As the temperature is further lowered, the mixuture state is taken over by the BEC state. The phase diagram of this system is presented and experimental implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Vector rogue waves in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01613v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study three-component rogue waves (RWs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Using the multiscale perturbative method, we obtain approximate analytical solutions for RWs with positive and negative effective masses, determined by the effective dispersion of the system. The solutions include RWs with smooth and striped shapes, as well as higher-order RWs. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the RWs in the three components of the system exhibit different velocities and their maximum peaks appear at the same spatiotemporal position, which is caused by SOC and interactions. The accuracy of the approximate analytical solutions is corroborated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the underlying system. Additionally, we systematically explore existence domains for the RWs determined by the baseband modulational instability (BMI). Numerical simulations corroborate that, under the action of BMI, plane waves with random initial perturbations excite RWs, as predicted by the approximate analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Interaction imbalanced spin-orbit coupled quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and quench dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an imbalance in intracomponent interactions. A plethora of miscible ground state stripe and standard (i.e., non-modulated) droplets is found depending on the SOC wavenumber and building upon Gaussian to flat-top background for increasing (decreasing) atom number (interactions). Deformations among the states were accompanied by spin population transfer caused by the Rabi coupling and could be controlled by adjusting the interactions or the SOC parameters. When considering a trap, we identified a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state, characterized by a sign change of the chemical potential, which occurred at lower (larger) atom numbers for tighter traps (stronger interactions). The droplet's breathing motion was accompanied by minor population transfer, and its frequency increases for a larger intracomponent interaction ratio or reaching a maximum at SOC wavenumbers, where the transition from non-modulated flat-top to stripe droplets occurred. We witness droplet fragmentation for abrupt changes in the Rabi coupling while large amplitude quenches of the SOC wavenumber trigger spin-demixing, resulting in constant amplitude but opposite direction motion of untrapped droplets or in-trap out-of-phase oscillating droplets. Our findings have implications for controlled spin-demixing processes of droplets and the excitation of relevant magnetic bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional space, we consider a system of $N$ anyons interacts via a short range attractive two-body interaction. In the stable regime, we derive the average-field Pauli functional as the mean-field limit of many-body quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we investigate the collapse phenomenon in the collapse regime where the strength of attractions tends to a critical value (defined by the cubic NLS equation) while simultaneously considering the weak field regime where the strength of the self-generated magnetic field tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Landau quantum phase transition in modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the quantum phase transition in modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chains. In the odd-N case, the transition separates a trivial non-degenerate phase to a doubly-degenerate gapped chiral PSU(N) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase which breaks spontaneously the inversion symmetry. The transition is not an Ising transition associated to the breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ inversion symmetry, but is governed by the delocalization of the edge states of the SPT phase. In this respect, a modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chain provides a simple example in one dimension of a non-Landau phase transition which is described by the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. We show that the chiral SPT phase exhibits fractionalized spinon excitations, which can be confined by changing the model parameters slightly.</description>

      <title>INTENTAS -- An entanglement-enhanced atomic sensor for microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INTENTAS project aims to develop an atomic sensor utilizing entangled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a microgravity environment. This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times. Successful demonstration of this technology in the Einstein-Elevator will pave the way for a future deployment in space, where its potential applications will unlock high-precision quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for the ground state of a one dimensional free electron gas on a circle the analytic expression for the canonical ensemble partition function can be easily derived from the density matrix by assuming that the thermodynamic limit coincides with the limit of the eigenfunction expansion of the kinetic energy. This approximation fails to give the finite temperature partition function because those two limits cannot be chosen as coincident.</description>

      <title>Stationary and moving bright solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling in a Zeeman field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the discovery of various matter wave solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), exploring their properties has become increasingly significant. We mainly study stationary and moving bright solitons in spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 BECs with or without a Zeeman field. The bright solitons correspond to the plane wave (PW) and standing wave (SW) phases. With the assistance of single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the existence domains of PW and SW solitons by analytical and numerical methods. The results indicate that the interaction between atoms is also a key factor determining the existence of solitons. In addition, we systematically discuss the stability domains of PW and SW solitons, and investigate the impact of different parameters on the stability domains. We find that PW solitons are unstable when the linear Zeeman effect reaches a certain threshold, and the threshold is determined by other parameters. The linear Zeeman effect also leads to the alternating distribution of stable and unstable areas of SW solitons, and makes SW solitons stably exist in the area with stronger ferromagnetism. Finally, we analyze the collision dynamics of different types of stable solitons.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effect in an ultracold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. One example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas like curved space, high-order topological phases, and black holes, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here, we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin-orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with non-zero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Further, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the center of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points (EPs) are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated EPs emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.</description>

      <title>Enhanced many-body quantum scars from the non-Hermitian Fock skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian pumping. Here we show that in kinetically-constrained many-body systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice with laser-induced loss. Additionally, we implement digital simulations of such scar enhancement on the IBM quantum processor. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-driven magnetic phase transitions in SU(4)-symmetric Fermi gas in three-dimensional optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study SU(4)-symmetric ultracold fermionic mixture in the cubic optical lattice with the variable tunneling amplitude along one particular crystallographic axis in the crossover region from the two- to three-dimensional spatial geometry. To theoretically analyze emerging magnetic phases and physical observables, we describe the system in the framework of the Fermi-Hubbard model and apply dynamical mean-field theory. We show that in two limiting cases of anisotropy there are two phases with different antiferromagnetic orderings in the zero temperature limit and determine a region of their coexistence. We also study the stability regions of different magnetically-ordered states and density profiles of the gas in the harmonic optical trap.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Partial confinement in a quantum-link simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary particles, have recently garnered wide attention in quantum simulations based on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems subject to gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Landau levels and their analogs with higher Chern numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau levels are the eigenstates of a charged particle in two dimensions under a magnetic field, and are at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are two prototypical phenomena showing topological features. Following recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall phases in van der Waals materials, there is a rapid progress in understanding of the precise condition under which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized. It is now understood that the key to obtaining the fractional quantum Hall phases is the energy band whose eigenstates are holomorphic functions in both real and momentum space coordinates. Landau levels are indeed examples of such energy bands with an additional special property of having flat geometrical features. In this paper, we prove that, in fact, the only energy eigenstates having holomorphic wave functions with a flat geometry are the Landau levels and their higher Chern number analogs. Since it has been known that any holomorphic eigenstates can be constructed from the ones with a flat geometry such as the Landau levels, our uniqueness proof of the Landau levels allows one to construct any possible holomorphic eigenstate with which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized.</description>

      <title>Active quantum flocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flocks of animals represent a fascinating archetype of collective behavior in the macroscopic classical world, where the constituents, such as birds, concertedly perform motions and actions as if being one single entity. Here, we address the outstanding question of whether flocks can also form in the microscopic world at the quantum level. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of active quantum matter by formulating a class of models of active quantum particles on a one-dimensional lattice. We provide both analytical and large-scale numerical evidence that these systems can give rise to quantum flocks. A key finding is that these flocks, unlike classical ones, exhibit distinct quantum properties by developing strong quantum coherence over long distances. We propose that quantum flocks could be experimentally observed in Rydberg atom arrays. Our work paves the way towards realizing the intriguing collective behaviors of biological active particles in quantum matter systems. We expect that this opens up a path towards a yet totally unexplored class of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems with unique properties.</description>

      <title>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01490v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced efficiency. Our ResumEE exponentially speeds up the computation of the exponentially small value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order R\'enyi EE, such that the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily computed with high accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on 2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE algorithm is efficient for precisely evaluating the entanglement entropy of SU($N$) spin models with continuous $N$ and reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in 2+1D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, which prevents thermalization from certain initial states after a long time, has been established across different quantum many-body systems. These include gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 quantum link models. Establishing quantum scars in gauge theories with high spin is not accessible with existing numerical methods, which rely on exact diagonalization. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ quantum link models. Our analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods and can guide quantum simulation experiments toward interesting non-equilibrium phenomena, inaccessible otherwise.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum battery realized with a few interacting particles in a three-well system with different on-site energies, which could be realized with ultracold atom platforms. We prepare the initial state in the lowest energy well and charge the battery using a Spatial Adiabatic Passage (SAP)-based protocol, enabling the population of a higher energy well. We examine the charging under varying interaction strengths and reveal that the consideration of collective charging results in an intriguing oscillatory behavior of the final charge for finite interactions, through diabatic evolution. Our findings open a new avenue for building stable and controllable quantum batteries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for efficient and scalable simulations of measurement and control of quantum systems built upon existing phase-space methods, namely the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA). We benchmark against existing particle-filter methods by simulating measurement based feedback cooling in a two-mode system, whose low-dimensional nature permits a computation of an exact solution. The advantage of our method is multi-mode scalability, which we demonstrate through the first successful simulation of measurement-based feedback cooling of an incoherent quasi-1D thermal ensemble to quantum degeneracy. As the underlying principle of our approach exploits a general correspondence between measurement and coherent feedback, we anticipate it is also applicable across a broad range of other quantum control scenarios.</description>
