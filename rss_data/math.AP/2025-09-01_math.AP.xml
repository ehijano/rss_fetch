      <title>Propagation in the Fisher-KPP equation with Mixed Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our investigation focuses on the asymptotic spreading behavior of the Fisher-KPP equation with a mixed local-nonlocal operator in the diffusion (see the work by X. Cabr\'e and J.-M. Roquejoffre, 2013, ref.[8]) to the setting of mixed diffusion, which involves both the classical and the fractional Laplacian in order to analyze the long-time dynamics of the equation. A key step in our approach involves the construction and detailed study of the heat kernel associated with the mixed operator, which we use to develop a theory of mild solutions and establish a comparison principle in suitable weighted function spaces.
  This framework allows us to rigorously establish the non-existence of traveling waves and characterize the large-time spreading rate of solutions. We show that the influence of the fractional Laplacian dominates over the classical Laplacian, especially in the initial layer, where it dictates the exponential propagation rate and the thickness of the solution tails.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for the transmission eigenvalues of periodic scatterers of bounded support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transmission eigenvalues for a bounded scatterer with a periodically varying index of refraction, and derive the first order corrections to the limiting transmission eigenvalues. We assume the scatterer contrast to be of one sign, in which case the transmission eigenvalue problem can be written in terms of operators corresponding to a fourth order PDE with periodic coefficients. We perform two-scale asymptotics for this biharmonic type homogenization problem and show convergence estimates which require a boundary corrector function, and this boundary corrector function appears in the formula for the transmission eigenvalues correction.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and nonlinear waves close to a 1:1 resonant Turing and Turing--Hopf instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of a pattern-forming system close to simultaneous Turing and Turing--Hopf instabilities, which have a 1:1 spatial resonance, that is, they have the same critical wave number. For this, we consider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms and general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we derive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a singular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by providing error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to the amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which connect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of solutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval, which model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction is based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast travelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially periodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold reduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to handle fast oscillatory higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for the relative isoperimetric problem and its gradient flow outside convex bodies in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove three related quantitative results for the relative isoperimetric problem outside a convex body $\Omega$ in the plane: (1) {\L}ojasiewicz estimates and quantitative rigidity for critical points, (2) rates of convergence for the gradient flow, and (3) quantitative stability for minimizers. These results come with explicit constants and optimal exponents/rates, and hold whenever a simple two-dimensional auxiliary variational problem for circular arcs outside of $\Omega$ is nondegenerate. The proofs are inter-related, and in particular, for the first time in the context of isoperimetric problems, a flow approach is used to prove quantitative stability for minimizers.</description>

      <title>Propagation of smallness near codimension two for gradients of harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $u$ be a harmonic function in the unit ball $B_1 \subset \mathbb R^n$, normalized so that its gradient has magnitude at most 1 on the unit ball. We show that if the gradient of $u$ is $\epsilon$-small in size on a set $E\subset B_{1/2}$ with positive $(n-2+\delta)$-dimensional Hausdorff content for some $\delta&gt;0$, then $\sup_{B_{1/2}} |\nabla u| \leq C \epsilon^\alpha$ with $C,\alpha&gt;0$ depending only on $n,\delta$ and the $(n-2+\delta)$-Hausdorff content of $E$. This is an improvement over a similar result of Logunov and Malinnikova that required $\delta&gt;1-c_n$ for a small dimensional constant $c_n$ and reaches the sharp threshold for the dimension of the smallness sets from which propagation of smallness can occur.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability in hypercontractivity estimates and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove stability results in hypercontractivity estimates for the Hopf--Lax semigroup in $\mathbb R^n$ and apply them to deduce stability results for the Euclidean $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality for any $p&gt;1$. As a main tool, we use recent stability results for the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality, due to B\"or\"oczky and De (2021), Figalli and Ramos (2024) and Figalli, van Hintum, and Tiba (2025). Under mild assumptions on the functions, most of our stability results turn out to be sharp, as they are reflected in the optimal exponent $1/2$ both in the hypercontractivity and $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev deficits, respectively. This approach also works for establishing stability of Gaussian hypercontractivity estimates and Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality, respectively.</description>

      <title>F-equivalence for parabolic systems and applications to the stabilization of nonlinear PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $F$-equivalence problem for parabolic systems: under which conditions a control system, governed by a parabolic operator $A$ and a control operator $B$, can be made equivalent to an arbitrarily exponentially stable evolution system through an appropriate control feedback law? While this problem has been resolved for finite-dimensional systems fifty years ago, good conditions for infinite-dimensional systems remain a challenge, especially for systems in spatial dimension larger than one. Our main result establishes optimal conditions for the existence of an $F$-equivalence pair $(T,K)$ for a given parabolic control system $(A,B)$. We introduce an extended framework for $F$-equivalence of parabolic operators, addressing key limitations of existing approaches, and we prove that the pair $(T,K)$ is unique if and only if $(A,B)$ is approximately controllable. As a consequence, this provides a method to construct feedback operators for the rapid stabilization of semilinear parabolic systems, possibly multi-dimensional in space. We provide several illustrative examples, including the rapid stabilization of the heat equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the quasilinear heat equation.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the non-radial inhomogeneous Hartree equation with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the focusing generalized inhomogeneous Hartree equation with potential \[ i u_t + \Delta u - V(x)u + \left(I_{\gamma} * |x|^{-b}|u|^{p}\right)|x|^{-b}|u|^{p-2}u = 0, \] where $0&lt;\gamma&lt;3$ and $0&lt;b&lt;\frac{1+\gamma}{2}$. We prove scattering in the intercritical case for nonradial initial data, under a mass-potential condition that generalizes the usual mass-energy threshold. The main new points compared to previous works are the inhomogeneous weight $|x|^{-b}$ and the presence of a potential $V$, which lead us to study the perturbed operator $-\Delta + V$.
  Our proof follows the general strategy of Murphy, but we need to adapt several steps to deal with the weight and the potential. We use Tao's scattering criterion together with localized Morawetz estimates in this setting. As a preliminary step, we establish global well-posedness for small data, which, in the presence of $V$, requires careful analysis using appropriate admissible Strichartz pairs.</description>

      <title>Survival probability for jump processes in unbounded domains on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large time behavior of the survival probability $\mathbb{P}_x\left(\tau_D&gt;t\right)$ for symmetric jump processes in unbounded domains with a positive bottom of the spectrum. We prove asymptotic upper and lower bounds with explicit constants in terms of the bottom of the spectrum $\lambda(D)$. Our main result applies to symmetric jump processes in general metric measure spaces. For $\alpha$-stable processes in unbounded uniformly $C^{1,1}$ domains, our results provide a probabilistic interpretation and an equivalent geometric condition for $\lambda(D)&gt;0$. In the case of increasing horn-shaped domains, the exponential rate of decay for the survival probability is sharp. We also present examples of unbounded domains where our results apply.</description>

      <title>Fractional Heat Semigroup Characterization of Distances from Functions in Lipschitz Spaces to Their Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_s$ denote the inhomogeneous Lipschitz space of order $s\in(0,\infty)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. This article characterizes the distance $d(f, V)_{\Lambda_s}: = \inf_{g\in V} \|f-g\|_{\Lambda_s}$ from a function $f\in \Lambda_s$ to a non-dense subspace $V\subset \Lambda_s$ via the fractional semigroup $\{T_{\alpha, t}: =e^{-t (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}: t\in (0, \infty)\}$ for any $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. Given an integer $ r &gt;s/\alpha$, a uniformly bounded continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ belongs to the space $\Lambda_s$ if and only if there exists a constant $\lambda\in(0,\infty)$ such that \begin{align*} \left|(-\Delta)^{\frac {\alpha r}2} (T_{\alpha, t^\alpha } f)(x) \right|\leq \lambda t^{s -r\alpha }\ \ \text{for any $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $t\in (0, 1]$}.\end{align*} The least such constant is denoted by $\lambda_{ \alpha, r, s}(f)$. For each $f\in \Lambda_s$ and $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt; \lambda_{\alpha,r, s}(f)$, let $$ D_{\alpha, r}(s,f,\varepsilon):=\left\{ (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}^n\times (0,1]:\ \left| (-\Delta)^{\frac {\alpha r}2} (T_{\alpha, t^\alpha} f)(x) \right|&gt; \varepsilon t^{s -r \alpha }\right\}$$ be the set of ``bad'' points. To quantify its size, we introduce a class of extended nonnegative \emph{admissible set functions} $\nu$ on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n\times [0, 1])$ and define, for any admissible function $\nu$, the \emph{critical index} $ \varepsilon_{\alpha, r, s,\nu}(f):=\inf\{\varepsilon\in(0,\infty):\ \nu(D_{\alpha, r}(s,f,\varepsilon))&lt;\infty\}.$ Our result shows that, for a broad class of subspaces $V\subset \Lambda_s$, including intersections of $\Lambda_s$ with Sobolev, Besov, Triebel--Lizorkin, and Besov-type spaces, there exists an admissible function $\nu$ depending on $V$ such that $\varepsilon_{\alpha, r, s,\nu}(f)\sim \mathrm{dist}(f, V)_{\Lambda_s}.$</description>

      <title>Random domain decomposition for parabolic PDEs on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of complex systems, such as gas transport in large pipeline networks, often involves solving PDEs posed on intricate graph structures. Such problems require considerable computational and memory resources. The Random Batch Method (RBM) has shown promise in addressing these challenges via stochastic decomposition techniques. In this paper, we apply the RBM at the PDE level for parabolic equations on graphs, without assuming any preliminary discretization in space or time. We consider a non-overlapping domain decomposition in which the PDE coefficients and source terms are randomized. We prove that the resulting RBM-based scheme converges, in the mean-square sense and uniformly in time, to the true PDE solution with first-order accuracy in the RBM step size. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence rate and demonstrate substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time compared to solving on the full graph. Moreover, these advantages persist across different time discretization schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mean field game of controls, a large population of identical players seek to minimize a cost that depends on the joint distribution of the states of the players and their controls. We consider the classes of mean field games of controls in which the value function and the distribution of player states satisfy either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that such systems are well-posed either with sufficient smallness conditions or in the case of monotone couplings.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup for the Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier-Stokes model equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03434v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations. These equations are analogous to the Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respectively, but with the Helmholtz projection replaced by a projection onto a more restrictive constraint space; the $(u\cdot\nabla)u$ nonlinearity is otherwise unchanged. The constraint space restricts the divergence-free velocity to specific Fourier modes, which have a dyadic shell structure, and are constructed iteratively using permutations.
  In the inviscid case -- and in the hypo-viscous case when $\alpha&lt;\frac{\log(3)}{6\log(2)} \approx .264$ -- we prove finite-time blowup for a set of solutions with a discrete group of symmetries. Our blowup Ansatz is odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$. The Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respect both the energy equality and the identity for enstrophy growth from the full Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respectively, which is a substantial advance over the previous literature on Euler and Navier--Stokes model equations.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces new methods to study the long time behaviour of the generalised gradient flow associated with a solution of the critical equation for mechanical Hamiltonian system posed on the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. For this analysis it is necessary to look at the critical set of $u$ consisting of all the points on $\mathbb{T}^d$ such that zero belongs to the super-differential of such a solution. Indeed, such a set turns out to be an attractor for the generalised gradient flow. Moreover, being the critical set the union of two subsets of rather different nature, namely the regular critical set and the singular set, we are interested in establishing whether the generalised gradient flow approaches the former or the latter as $t\to \infty$. One crucial tool of our analysis is provided by limiting occupational measures, a family of measures that are invariant under the generalized flow. Indeed, we show that by integrating the potential with respect to such measures, one can deduce whether the generalised gradient flow enters the singular set in finite time, or it approaches the regular critical set as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Resolvent and Eigenfunction Stability for the Faber-Krahn Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the same volume as the unit ball, the classical Faber-Krahn inequality says that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\Omega)$ of the Laplacian is at least that of the unit ball $B$. We prove that the deficit $\lambda_1(\Omega)- \lambda_1(B)$ in the Faber-Krahn inequality controls the square of the distance between the resolvent operator $(-\Delta_\Omega)^{-1}$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega$ and the resolvent operator on the nearest unit ball $B(x_\Omega)$. The distance is measured by the operator norm from $L^{\infty}$ to $L^2$. As a main application, we show that the Faber-Krahn deficit $\lambda_1(\Omega)- \lambda_1(B)$ controls the squared $L^2$ norm between $k$th eigenfunctions on $\Omega$ and $B(x_\Omega)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}.$ In both of these main theorems, the quadratic power is optimal.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of singular SPDEs with Correlated Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show local well-posedness of the g-PAM and the $\phi^{K+1}_2$-equation for $K\geq 1$ on the two-dimensional torus when the coefficient field is random and correlated to the driving noise. In the setting considered here, even when the model in the sense of [Hai14] is stationary, naive use of renormalisation constants in general leads to variance blow-up. Instead, we prove convergence of renormalised models choosing random renormalisation functions analogous to the deterministic variable coefficient setting. The main technical contribution are stochastic estimates on the model in this correlated setting which are obtained by a combination of heat kernel asymptotics, Gaussian integration by parts formulae and Hairer--Quastel type bounds [HQ18].</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of transonic shock solutions in general approximate nozzles for steady potential flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions with a transonic shock in a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a special metric, which can be regarded as an approximate model of the general physical nozzles, within a class of transonic shock solutions for steady potential flow. We first prove the uniqueness of these solutions on the unit 2-sphere: for given uniform supersonic upstream flow at the entry, there exists a unique uniform pressure at the exit such that a transonic shock solution exists in the sphere, which is unique modulo a translation. A similar result is then extended to a class of manifolds. Mathematically, it is equivalent to showing a uniqueness theorem for a free boundary problem of a second-order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed-type partial differential equation in the general approximate nozzles. The proof is based on the maximum/comparison principle with a suitable special transonic shock solution as a comparison function.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of 2D singular stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by noise that has the regularity of space-time white noise but doesn't exactly coincide with it. We show that, provided that the intensity of the noise is sufficiently weak at high frequencies, this systems admits uniform bounds in time, so that it has an invariant measure, for which we obtain stretched exponential tail bounds.</description>
