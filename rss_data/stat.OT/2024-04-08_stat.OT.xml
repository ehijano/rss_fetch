      <title>Non-Parametric Estimation of Multiple Periodic Components in Turkey's Electricity Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric generation and consumption are an essential component of contemporary living, influencing diverse facets of our daily routines, convenience, and economic progress. There is a high demand for characterizing the periodic pattern of electricity consumption. VBPBB employs a bandpass filter aligned to retain the frequency of a PC component and eliminating interference from other components. This leads to a significant reduction in the size of bootstrapped confidence intervals. Furthermore, other PC bootstrap methods preserve one but not multiple periodically correlated components, resulting in superior performance compared to other methods by providing a more precise estimation of the sampling distribution for the desired characteristics. The study of the periodic means of Turkey electricity consumption using VBPBB is presented and compared with outcomes from alternative bootstrapping approaches. These findings offer significant evidence supporting the existence of daily, weekly, and annual PC patterns, along with information on their timing and confidence intervals for their effects. This information is valuable for enhancing predictions and preparations for future responses to electricity consumption.</description>

      <title>Human-Centric and Integrative Lighting Asset Management in Public Libraries: Qualitative Insights and Challenges from a Swedish Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional lighting source reliability evaluations, often covering just half of a lamp's volume, can misrepresent real-world performance. To overcome these limitations,adopting advanced asset management strategies for a more holistic evaluation is crucial. This paper investigates human-centric and integrative lighting asset management in Swedish public libraries. Through field observations, interviews, and gap analysis, the study highlights a disparity between current lighting conditions and stakeholder expectations, with issues like eye strain suggesting significant improvement potential. We propose a shift towards more dynamic lighting asset management and reliability evaluations, emphasizing continuous enhancement and comprehensive training in human-centric and integrative lighting principles.</description>
