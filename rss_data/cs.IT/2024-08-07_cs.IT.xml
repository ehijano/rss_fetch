      <title>On Galois duality, self-orthogonality, and dual-containment of matrix product codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent literature, matrix product (MP) codes and their duals have gained significant attention due to their application in the construction of quantum stabilizer codes. In this paper, we begin with providing a formula that characterizes the Galois dual of MP codes. Using this formula, we establish the conditions under which MP codes are self-orthogonal and dual-containing. Although similar results may exist in the literature, the novelty and superiority of our results can be identified in the following points. Previous results that characterize the duals of MP codes only apply to MP codes with an invertible square defining matrix $\mathcal{A}$. However, our characterization applies to MP code with any defining matrix, whether $\mathcal{A}$ is not square or not of full row rank. Previous studies on the conditions for self-orthogonality or dual-containment of MP codes have assumed certain structures for the product $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{A}^T$ or $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{A}^{\dagger}$, such as being diagonal, anti-diagonal, monomial, or partitioned Hermitian orthogonal. However, our conditions do not necessitate such specific structures. Previous studies investigated MP code duality in the context of Euclidean and Hermitian duals; however, we investigate MP code duality in the broader context of Galois dual, with Euclidean and Hermitian duals acting as special cases. Finally, it is worth noting that the proposed conditions for Galois self-orthogonality or dual-containment are both necessary and sufficient. To demonstrate the theoretical results, several numerical examples with best-known parameters MP codes are provided.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting for Joint Unicast and Multicast Transmission in LEO Satellite Networks with Non-Uniform Traffic Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SATCOM) with ubiquitous global connectivity is deemed a pivotal catalyst in advancing wireless communication systems for 5G and beyond. LEO SATCOM excels in delivering versatile information services across expansive areas, facilitating both unicast and multicast transmissions via high-speed broadband capability. Nonetheless, given the broadband coverage of LEO SATCOM, traffic demand distribution within the service area is non-uniform, and the time/frequency/power resources available at LEO satellites remain significantly limited. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a rate-matching framework for non-orthogonal unicast and multicast (NOUM) transmission. Our approach aims to minimize the difference between offered rates and traffic demands for both unicast and multicast messages. By multiplexing unicast and multicast transmissions over the same radio resource, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed to manage interference between unicast and multicast streams, as well as inter-user interference under imperfect channel state information at the LEO satellite. To address the formulated problems non-smoothness and non-convexity, the common rate is approximated using the LogSumExp technique. Thereafter, we represent the common rate portion as the ratio of the approximated function, converting the problem into an unconstrained form. A generalized power iteration (GPI)-based algorithm, coined GPI-RS-NOUM, is proposed upon this reformulation. Through comprehensive numerical analysis across diverse simulation setups, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms various benchmarks for LEO SATCOM with uneven traffic demands.</description>

      <title>Binary Triorthogonal and CSS-T Codes for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study binary triorthogonal codes and their relation to CSS-T quantum codes. We characterize the binary triorthogonal codes that are minimal or maximal with respect to the CSS-T poset, and we also study how to derive new triorthogonal matrices from existing ones. Given a binary triorthogonal matrix, we characterize which of its equivalent matrices are also triorthogonal. As a consequence, we show that a binary triorthogonal matrix uniquely determines the parameters of the corresponding triorthogonal quantum code, meaning that any other equivalent matrix that is also triorthogonal gives rise to a triorthogonal quantum code with the same parameters.</description>

      <title>Learned Trimmed-Ridge Regression for Channel Estimation in Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation poses significant challenges in millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, especially when the base station has fewer radio-frequency chains than antennas. To address this challenge, one promising solution exploits the beamspace channel sparsity to reconstruct full-dimensional channels from incomplete measurements. This paper presents a model-based deep learning method to reconstruct sparse, as well as approximately sparse, vectors fast and accurately. To implement this method, we propose a trimmed-ridge regression that transforms the sparse-reconstruction problem into a least-squares problem regularized by a nonconvex penalty term, and then derive an iterative solution. We then unfold the iterations into a deep network that can be implemented in online applications to realize real-time computations. To this end, an unfolded trimmed-ridge regression model is constructed using a structural configuration to reduce computational complexity and a model ensemble strategy to improve accuracy. Compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models, the proposed learning scheme achieves better accuracy and supports higher downlink sum rates.</description>

      <title>Causal Vector-valued Witsenhausen Counterexamples with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuous vector-valued Witsenhausen counterexample through the lens of empirical coordination coding. We characterize the region of achievable pairs of costs in three scenarios: (i) causal encoding and causal decoding, (ii) causal encoding and causal decoding with channel feedback, and (iii) causal encoding and noncausal decoding with channel feedback. In these vector-valued versions of the problem, the optimal coding schemes must rely on a time-sharing strategy, since the region of achievable pairs of costs might not be convex in the scalar version of the problem. We examine the role of the channel feedback when the encoder is causal and the decoder is either causal or non-causal, and we show that feedback improves the performance, only when the decoder is non-causal.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore constructions for codes that correct two bursts of deletions, with each burst having length exactly $b$. Previously, the best known construction, derived using the syndrome compression technique, achieved a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$. In this work, we present new constructions for all $q\ge 2$ that achieve redundancy at most $7\log n+O(\log\log n)$ when $b&gt;1$. Additionally, for $b=1$, we provide a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with redundancy $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ for all $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study rank metric codes over Galois rings. In particular, we prove MacWilliams identities for finite chain rings relating the sequences of $q$-binomial moments of a code and its dual and for Gabidulin analogues of free codes over Galois rings we prove the corresponding MacWilliams identity as a functional expression relating the weight enumerator of the dual with the MacWilliams transform of the weight enumerator of the original code plus one extra term attached to the zero divisors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Gaussian Strategies for Vector-valued Witsenhausen Counterexample with Non-causal State Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a vector-valued Witsenhausen model where the second decision maker (DM) acquires a vector of observations before selecting a vector of estimations. Here, the first DM acts causally whereas the second DM estimates non-causally. When the vector length grows, we characterize, via a single-letter expression, the optimal trade-off between the power cost at the first DM and the estimation cost at the second DM. In this paper, we show that the best linear scheme is achieved by using the time-sharing method between two affine strategies, which coincides with the convex envelope of the solution of Witsenhausen in 1968. Here also, Witsenhausen's two-point strategy and the scheme of Grover and Sahai in 2010 where both devices operate non-causally, outperform our best linear scheme. Therefore, gains obtained with block-coding schemes are only attainable if all DMs operate non-causally.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Compression Design for 6G Networked Sensing with Limited-Capacity Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers networked sensing in cellular network, where multiple base stations (BSs) first compress their received echo signals from multiple targets and then forward the quantized signals to the cloud via limited-capacity backhaul links, such that the cloud can leverage all useful echo signals to perform high-resolution localization. Under this setup, we manage to characterize the posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) for localizing all the targets as a function of the transmit covariance matrix and the compression noise covariance matrix of each BS. Then, a PCRB minimization problem subject to the transmit power constraints and the backhaul capacity constraints is formulated to jointly design the BSs' transmission and compression strategies. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the alternating optimization technique. Specifically, it is shown that when either the transmit covariance matrices or the compression noise covariance matrices are fixed, the successive convex approximation technique can be leveraged to optimize the other type of covariance matrices locally. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Model for Offline Scheduling Policy of Low-density Parity-check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, an optimization model for offline scheduling policy of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed to improve the decoding efficiency of the belief propagation (BP). The optimization model uses the number of messages passed (NMP) as a metric to evaluate complexity, and two metrics, average entropy (AE), and gap to maximum a posteriori (GAP), to evaluate BP decoding performance. Based on this model, an algorithm is proposed to optimize the scheduling sequence for reduced decoding complexity and superior performance compared to layered BP. We validated the proposed algorithm on LDPC codes constructed following 5G New Radio, which resulted in a reduction of decoding complexity of more than 20$\%$ compared to LBP.</description>

      <title>A connection between the boomerang uniformity and the extended differential in odd characteristic and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes the first bridge between the classical differential/boomerang uniformity and the newly introduced $c$-differential uniformity. We show that the boomerang uniformity of an odd APN function is given by the maximum of the entries (except for the first row/column) of the function's $(-1)$-Difference Distribution Table. In fact, the boomerang uniformity of an odd permutation APN function equals its $(-1)$-differential uniformity. We next apply this result to easily compute the boomerang uniformity of several odd APN functions. In the second part we give two classes of differentially low-uniform functions obtained by modifying the inverse function. The first class of permutations (CCZ-inequivalent to the inverse) over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ ($p$, an odd prime) is obtained from the composition of the inverse function with an order-$3$ cycle permutation, with differential uniformity $3$ if $p=3$ and $n$ is odd; $5$ if $p=13$ and $n$ is even; and $4$ otherwise. The second class is a family of binomials and we show that their differential uniformity equals~$4$. We next complete the open case of $p=3$ in the investigation started by G\" olo\u glu and McGuire (2014), for $p\geq 5$, and continued by K\"olsch (2021), for $p=2$, $n\geq 5$, on the characterization of $L_1(X^{p^n-2})+L_2(X)$ (with linearized $L_1,L_2$) being a permutation polynomial. Finally, we extend to odd characteristic a result of Charpin and Kyureghyan (2010) providing an upper bound for the differential uniformity of the function and its switched version via a trace function.</description>

      <title>On the Identifiability from Modulo Measurements under DFT Sensing Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulo sampling (MS) has been recently introduced to enhance the dynamic range of conventional ADCs by applying a modulo operator before sampling. This paper examines the identifiability of a measurement model where measurements are taken using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sensing matrix, followed by a modulo operator (modulo-DFT). Firstly, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the unique identification of the modulo-DFT sensing model based on the number of measurements and the indices of zero elements in the original signal. Then, we conduct a deeper analysis of three specific cases: when the number of measurements is a power of $2$, a prime number, and twice a prime number. Additionally, we investigate the identifiability of periodic bandlimited (PBL) signals under MS, which can be considered as the modulo-DFT sensing model with additional symmetric and conjugate constraints on the original signal. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition based solely on the number of samples in one period for the unique identification of the PBL signal under MS, though with an ambiguity in the direct current (DC) component. Furthermore, we show that when the oversampling factor exceeds $3(1+1/P)$, the PBL signal can be uniquely identified with an ambiguity in the DC component, where $P$ is the number of harmonics, including the fundamental component, in the positive frequency part. Finally, we also present a recovery algorithm that estimates the original signal by solving integer linear equations, and we conduct simulations to validate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Point-to-set Principle and Constructive Dimension Faithfulness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hausdorff $\Phi$-dimension is a notion of Hausdorff dimension developed using a restricted class of coverings of a set. We introduce a constructive analogue of $\Phi$-dimension using the notion of constructive $\Phi$-$s$-supergales. We prove a Point-to-Set Principle for $\Phi$-dimension, through which we get Point-to-Set Principles for Hausdorff dimension, continued-fraction dimension and dimension of Cantor coverings as special cases. We also provide a Kolmogorov complexity characterization of constructive $\Phi$-dimension.
  A class of covering sets $\Phi$ is said to be "faithful" to Hausdorff dimension if the $\Phi$-dimension and Hausdorff dimension coincide for every set. Similarly, $\Phi$ is said to be "faithful" to constructive dimension if the constructive $\Phi$-dimension and constructive dimension coincide for every set. Using the Point-to-Set Principle for Cantor coverings and a new technique for the construction of sequences satisfying a certain Kolmogorov complexity condition, we show that the notions of ``faithfulness'' of Cantor coverings at the Hausdorff and constructive levels are equivalent.
  We adapt the result by Albeverio, Ivanenko, Lebid, and Torbin to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the constructive dimension faithfulness of the coverings generated by the Cantor series expansion, based on the terms of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Density Evolution Analysis of Generalized Low-density Parity-check Codes under a Posteriori Probability Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the performance of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes under the a posteriori probability (APP) decoder is analyzed. We explore the concentration, symmetry, and monotonicity properties of GLDPC codes under the APP decoder, extending the applicability of density evolution to GLDPC codes. On the binary memoryless symmetric channels, using the BEC and BI-AWGN channels as two examples, we demonstrate that with an appropriate proportion of generalized constraint (GC) nodes, GLDPC codes can reduce the original gap to capacity compared to their original LDPC counterparts. Additionally, on the BI-AWGN channel, we apply and improve the Gaussian approximation algorithm in the density evolution of GLDPC codes. By adopting Gaussian mixture distributions to approximate the message distributions from variable nodes and Gaussian distributions for those from constraint nodes, the precision of the channel parameter threshold can be significantly enhanced while maintaining a low computational complexity similar to that of Gaussian approximations. Furthermore, we identify a class of subcodes that can greatly simplify the performance analysis and practical decoding of GLDPC codes, which we refer to as message-invariant subcodes. Using the aforementioned techniques, our simulation experiments provide empirical evidence that GLDPC codes, when decoded with the APP decoder and equipped with the right fraction of GC nodes, can achieve substantial performance improvements compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Ultra-Wideband Dual-Polarized Conformal Phased Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents an innovative design and implementation method for an ultra-wideband dual-polarized conformal phased array. The performance of single-layer continuous dipoles under bending conditions is evaluated through characteristic mode analysis to understand the impact of curvature on operational stability. This analysis provides design insights into the maximum allowable curvature while maintaining stable dipole performance. Subsequently, a single-layer metal radiation structure is designed as the array element, and simulations indicate that it supports ultra-wideband operation with dual polarizations. Using this element, an 8 * 8 ultra-wideband dual-polarized cylindrical-conformal array (UDCA) is developed, demonstrating stable performance even at a curvature radius as small as 100 mm. A physical prototype is fabricated cost-effectively using novel manufacturing techniques that stack a three-layer conformal substrate. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed UDCA with a 1.2{\lambda} curvature radius operates at 3.6~9.6 GHz (90.9%) and achieves 60{\deg} wide-scanning in E-/H-planes, which provides a practical and promising solution for conformal array applications.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>

Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation-based protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>RIS Assisted Wireless Networks: Collaborative Regulation, Deployment Mode and Field Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08644</link>

Abstract: In recent years, RIS has made significant progress in engineering application research and industrialization and academic research. However, the engineering application research field of RIS still faces several challenges. This article analyzes and discusses the two deployment modes of RIs-assisted wireless networks: Network Controlled Mode and Standalone mode. It also presents three typical collaboration scenarios of RIS networks, including multi-RIS collaboration, multi-user access, and multi-cell coordination, which reflect the differences between the two deployment modes of RIS. The article proposes collaborative regulation mechanisms for RIS and analyzes their applications in the two network deployment modes in-depth. Furthermore, the article establishes simulation models of three scenarios and provides rich numerical simulation results. An actual field test environment was also built, where a specially designed and processed RIS prototype was used for preliminary field test and verification. Finally, this article puts forward future trends and challenges.</description>

      <title>Use-dependent Biases as Optimal Action under Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17793</link>

Abstract: Use-dependent bias is a phenomenon in human sensorimotor behavior whereby movements become biased towards previously repeated actions. Despite being well-documented, the reason why this phenomenon occurs is not yet clearly understood. Here, we propose that use-dependent biases can be understood as a rational strategy for movement under limitations on the capacity to process sensory information to guide motor output. We adopt an information-theoretic approach to characterize sensorimotor information processing and determine how behavior should be optimized given limitations to this capacity. We show that this theory naturally predicts the existence of use-dependent biases. Our framework also generates two further predictions. The first prediction relates to handedness. The dominant hand is associated with enhanced dexterity and reduced movement variability compared to the non-dominant hand, which we propose relates to a greater capacity for information processing in regions that control movement of the dominant hand. Consequently, the dominant hand should exhibit smaller use-dependent biases compared to the non-dominant hand. The second prediction relates to how use-dependent biases are affected by movement speed. When moving faster, it is more challenging to correct for initial movement errors online during the movement. This should exacerbate costs associated with initial directional error and, according to our theory, reduce the extent of use-dependent biases compared to slower movements, and vice versa. We show that these two empirical predictions, the handedness effect and the speed-dependent effect, are confirmed by experimental data.</description>
