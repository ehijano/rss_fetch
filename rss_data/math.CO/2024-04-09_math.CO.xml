      <title>A note on the multicolor size-Ramsey numbers of connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-color size-Ramsey number of a graph $H$, denoted $\hat{R}_r(H)$ is the smallest number of edges in a graph $G$ having the property that every $r$-coloring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$.
  Krivelevich proved that $\hat{R}_r(P_{m+1})=\Omega(r^2m)$ where $P_{m+1}$ is the path on $m$ edges. He explains that his proof actually applies to any connected graph $H$ with $m$ edges and vertex cover number larger than $\sqrt{m}$. He also notes that some restriction on the vertex cover number is necessary since the star with $m$ edges, $K_{1,m}$, has vertex cover number 1 and satisfies $\hat{R}_r(K_{1,m})=r(m-1)+1$. We prove that the star is actually the only exception; that is, $\hat{R}_r(H)=\Omega(r^2m)$ for every non-star connected graph $H$ with $m$ edges.
  We also prove a strengthening of this result for trees. It follows from results of Beck and Dellamonica that $\hat{R}_2(T)=\Theta(\beta(T))$ for every tree $T$ with bipartition $\{V_1, V_2\}$ and $\beta(T)=|V_1|\max\{d(v):v\in V_1\}+|V_2|\max\{d(v):v\in V_2\}$. We prove that $\hat{R}_r(T)=\Omega(r^2\beta(T))$ for every tree $T$, again with the exception of the star. Additionally, we prove that for a certain class of trees $\mathcal{T}$ (which includes all trees of radius 2 and all non-star trees with linear maximum degree) we have $\hat{R}_r(T)=\Theta(r^2\beta(T))$ for all $T\in \mathcal{T}$.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address two longstanding open problems, one originating in PL topology, another in birational geometry.
  First, we prove the weighted version of Oda's \emph{strong factorization conjecture} (1978), and prove that two toric varieties that are related by a common iterated blowup (at rationally smooth points).
  Second, we prove that every two PL homeomorphic polyhedra have a common stellar subdivisions, as conjectured by Alexander in 1930.</description>

      <title>Extremal problems for star forests and cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n, \mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of edges in any $\mathcal{F}$-free graph on $n$ vertices. Recently, Alon and Frankl studied of maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $\{K_{k+1}, M_{s+1}\}$-free graph, where $K_{k+1}$ is a complete graph on $k+1$ vertices and $M_{s+1}$ is a matching of $s+1$ edges. They determined the exact value of $ex(n, \{K_{k+1},M_{s+1}\})$. In this paper, we extend the matching $M_{s+1}$ to star forest $(s+1)S_l$, and determine the exact value of $ex(n, \{K_{k+1},(s+1)S_l\})$ for sufficiently large enough $n$. Furthermore, all the extremal graphs are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the number of minimal forts of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, a fort of a graph was introduced as a non-empty subset of vertices in which no vertex outside of the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Since then, forts have been used to characterize zero forcing sets, model the zero forcing number as an integer program, and generate lower bounds on the zero forcing number of a Cartesian product. In this article, we investigate the number of minimal forts of a graph, where a fort is minimal if every proper subset is not a fort. In particular, we show that the number of minimal forts of a graph of order at least six is strictly less than Sperner's bound, a famous bound due to Emanuel Sperner (1928) on the size of a collection of subsets where no subset contains another. Then, we derive an explicit formula for the number of minimal forts for several families of graphs, including the path, cycle, and spider graphs. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic growth rate of the number of minimal forts of the spider graph is bounded above by that of the path graph. We conjecture that the asymptotic growth rate of the path graph is extremal over all trees. Finally, we develop methods for constructing minimal forts of graph products using the minimal forts of the original graphs. In the process, we derive explicit formulas and lower bounds on the number of minimal forts for additional families of graphs, such as the wheel, sunlet, and windmill graphs. Most notably, we show that the family of windmill graphs has an exponential number of minimal forts with a maximum asymptotic growth rate of cube root of three, which is the largest asymptotic growth rate we have observed. We conjecture that there exist families of graphs with a larger asymptotic growth rate.</description>

      <title>Graphs of bounded chordality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hole in a graph is an induced subgraph which is a cycle of length at least four. A graph is chordal if it contains no holes. Following McKee and Scheinerman (1993), we define the chordality of a graph $G$ to be the minimum number of chordal graphs on $V(G)$ such that the intersection of their edge sets is equal to $E(G)$. In this paper we study classes of graphs of bounded chordality.
  In the 1970s, Buneman, Gavril, and Walter, proved independently that chordal graphs are exactly the intersection graphs of subtrees in trees. We generalize this result by proving that the graphs of chordality at most $k$ are exactly the intersection graphs of convex subgraphs of median graphs of tree-dimension $k$.
  A hereditary class of graphs $\mathcal{A}$ is $\chi$-bounded if there exists a function $ f\colon \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{A}$, we have $\chi(G) \leq f(\omega(G))$. In 1960, Asplund and Gr\"unbaum proved that the class of all graphs of boxicity at most two is $\chi$-bounded. In his seminal paper "Problems from the world surrounding perfect graphs," Gy\'arf\'as (1985), motivated by the above result, asked whether the class of all graphs of chordality at most two, which we denote by $\mathcal{C}\gcap \mathcal{C}$, is $\chi$-bounded. We discuss a result of Felsner, Joret, Micek, Trotter and Wiechert (2017), concerning tree-decompositions of Burling graphs, which implies an answer to Gy\'arf\'as' question in the negative. We prove that two natural families of subclasses of $\mathcal{C}\gcap \mathcal{C}$ are polynomially $\chi$-bounded.
  Finally, we prove that for every $k\geq 3$ the $k$-\textsc{Chordality Problem}, which asks to decide whether a graph has chordality at most $k$, is \textbf{NP}-complete.</description>

      <title>The chromatic symmetric function in the star-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Stanley's chromatic symmetric function (CSF) for trees when expressed in the star-basis. We use the deletion-near-contraction algorithm recently introduced in \cite{ADOZ} to compute coefficients that occur in the CSF in the star-basis. In particular, one of our main results determines the smallest partition in lexicographic order that occurs as an indexing partition in the CSF, and we also give a formula for its coefficient. In addition to describing properties of trees encoded in the coefficients of the star-basis, we give two main applications of the leading coefficient result. The first is a strengthening of the result in \cite{ADOZ} that says that proper trees of diameter less than or equal to 5 can be reconstructed from their CSFs. In this paper we show that this is true for all trees of diameter less than or equal 5. In our second application, we show that the dimension of the subspace of symmetric functions spanned by the CSF of $n$-vertex trees is $p(n)-n+1$, where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$.</description>

      <title>Weak colourings of Kirkman triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\delta$-colouring of the point set of a block design is said to be {\em weak} if no block is monochromatic. The {\em weak chromatic number} $\chi(S)$ of a block design $S$ is the smallest integer $\delta$ such that $S$ has a weak $\delta$-colouring. It has previously been shown that any Steiner triple system has weak chromatic number at least $3$ and that for each $v\equiv 1$ or $3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Steiner triple system on $v$ points that has weak chromatic number $3$. Moreover, for each integer $\delta \geq 3$ there exist infinitely many Steiner triple systems with weak chromatic number $\delta$.
  We consider colourings of the subclass of Steiner triple systems which are resolvable, namely Kirkman triple systems. We show that for each $v\equiv 3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Kirkman triple system on $v$ points with weak chromatic number $3$. We also show that for each integer $\delta \geq 3$, there exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with weak chromatic number $\delta$. We close with several open problems.</description>

      <title>Binary Cyclic Transversal Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With every family of finitely many subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space over the Galois-field with two elements we associate a cyclic transversal polytope. It turns out that those polytopes generalize several well-known polytopes that are relevant in combinatorial optimization, among them cut polytopes as well as stable set and matching polytopes. We introduce the class of lifted odd-set inequalities and prove results demonstrating their strength. In particular, we show that they suffice to describe cyclic transversal polytopes if the union of the sets in the family has rank at most two. We also describe extended formulations for cyclic transversal polytopes and introduce a special relaxation hierarchy for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a bicolored point set $P$ in general position in the plane consisting of $n$ blue and $n$ red points. We show that if a subset of the red points forms the vertices of a convex polygon separating the blue points, lying inside the polygon, from the remaining red points, lying outside the polygon, then the points of $P$ can be connected by non-crossing straight-line segments so that the resulting graph is a properly colored closed Hamiltonian path.</description>

      <title>Maximum Nim and Josephus Problem algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we study a Josephus problem algorithm. Let $n,k$ be positive integers and $g_k(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k-1} \right\rfloor +1$, where $ \left\lfloor \ \ \right\rfloor$ is a floor function. Suppose that there exists $p$ such that $g_{k}^{p-1}(0) &lt; n(k-1) \leq g_{k}^{p}(0)$, where $g_{k}^p$ is the $p$-th functional power of $g_k$. Then, the last number that remains is $nk-h2_{k}^{p}(0)$ in the Josephus problem of $n$ numbers, where every $k$-th numbers are removed. This algorithm is based on Maximum Nim with the rule function $f_k(n)=\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor$. Using the present article's result, we can build a new algorithm for Josephus problem.</description>

      <title>On cubic graphs having the maximal coalition number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coalition in a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ consists of two disjoint sets $V_1, V_2\subset V$ such that neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ is a dominating set, but the union $V_1\cup V_2$ is a dominating set in $G$. A partition of graph vertices is called a coalition partition $\mathcal{P}$ if every non-dominating set of $\mathcal{P}$ is a member of a coalition and every dominating set is a single-vertex set. The coalition number $C(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum cardinality of its coalition partition. It is known that for cubic graphs $C(G)\le 9$. The existence of cubic graphs with the maximal coalition number is an unsolved problem. In this paper, an infinite family of cubic graphs satisfying $C(G)=9$ is constructed.</description>

      <title>Recovering a Magnitude-Symmetric Matrix from its Principal Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of finding a magnitude-symmetric matrix (matrix with opposing off-diagonal entries equal in magnitude) with a prescribed set of principal minors. This problem is closely related to the theory of recognizing and learning signed determinantal point processes in machine learning, as kernels of these point processes are magnitude-symmetric matrices. In this work, we prove a number of properties regarding sparse and generic magnitude-symmetric matrices. We show that principal minors of order at most $\ell$, for some invariant $\ell$ depending only on principal minors of order at most two, uniquely determines principal minors of all orders. In addition, we produce a polynomial-time algorithm that, given access to principal minors, recovers a matrix with those principal minors using only a quadratic number of queries. Furthermore, when principal minors are known only approximately, we present an algorithm that approximately recovers a matrix, and show that the approximation guarantee of this algorithm cannot be improved in general.</description>

      <title>Resistance distance and Kirchhoff index in central vertex join and central edge join of two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central graph $C(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph obtained by inserting a new vertex into each edge of $G$ exactly once and joining all the non-adjacent vertices in $G$. Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be two vertex disjoint graphs. The central vertex join of $G_1$ and $G_2$ is the graph $ G_1\dot{\vee} G_2$, is obtained from $C(G_1)$ and $G_2$ by joining each vertex of $G_1$ with every vertex of $G_2$. The central edge join of $G_1$ and $G_2$ is the graph $ G_1\veebar G_2$, is obtained from $C(G_1)$ and $G_2$ by joining each vertex corresponding to the edges of $G_1$ with every vertex of $G_2$. In this article, we obtain formulae for the resistance distance and Kirchhoff index of $G_1\dot{\vee} G_2$ and $ G_1\veebar G_2$. In addition, we provide the resistance distance, Kirchhoff index, and Kemeny's constant of the central graph of a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize classical triangular Schubert puzzles to puzzles with convex polygonal boundary. We give these puzzles a geometric Schubert calculus interpretation and derive novel combinatorial commutativity statements, using purely geometric arguments, for puzzles with four, five, and six sides, having various types of symmetry in their boundary conditions. We also present formulas for the associated structure constants in terms of Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and we prove an analogue of commutativity for parallelogram-shaped equivariant puzzles.</description>

      <title>Elements with unique length factorization of a numerical semigroup generated by three consecutive numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be the numerical semigroup generated by three consecutive numbers $a,a+1,a+2$, where $a\in\mathbb{N}$, $a\geq 3$. We describe the elements of $S$ whose factorizations have all the same length, as well as the set of factorizations of each of these elements. We give natural partitions of this subset of $S$ in terms of the length and the denumerant. By using Ap\'ery sets and Betti elements we are able to extend some results, first obtained by elementary means.</description>

      <title>Circular chromatic number of Cartesian product of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the circular coloring of signed graphs. A signed graph is a graph with a signature that assigns a sign to each edge, either positive or negative. This paper studies circular coloring and a circular chromatic number of Type 1 and Type Cartesian products. We shall prove the following results: The circular chromatic number of Cartesian product Type 1 $(G,\sigma)\Box (H,\tau)$ is $\chi_{c}(G \Box H,\sigma\Box\tau)=\max\{\chi_{c}(G,\sigma),\chi_{c}(H,\tau)\}$ and the circular chromatic number of Cartesian product Type 2 $(G,\sigma)\Box' (H,\tau)$ satisfies $\chi_{c}(G \Box' H,\sigma\Box' \tau)\leq 2\max\{\chi_{c}(G),\chi_{c}(H)\}$.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the determinant of the graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study extremal values for the determinant of the weighted graph Laplacian under simple nondegeneracy conditions on the weights. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the determinant of the Laplacian to be bounded away from zero and for the existence of a minimizing set of weights. These conditions are given both in terms of properties of random spanning trees and in terms of a type of density on graphs. These results generalize and extend the work of [7].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that the disarray (or displacement) of an (affine) (signed) permutation is bounded in terms of its Coxeter length. Here, we characterize the permutations for which the bound is sharp in two ways: in terms of a natural property of their reduced words, and by ``globally'' avoiding the pattern 321.</description>

      <title>The maximum degree of the $r$th power of a sparse random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G^r_{n,p}$ denote the $r$th power of the random graph $G_{n,p}$, where $p=c/n$ for a positive constant $c$. We prove that w.h.p. the maximum degree $\Delta\left(G^r_{n,p}\right)\sim \frac{\log n}{\log_{(r+1)}n}$. Here $\log_{(k)}n$ indicates the repeated application of the log-function $k$ times. So, for example, $\log_{(3)}n=\log\log\log n$.</description>

      <title>Extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph, on four or more vertices, is matching covered if every edge is present in some perfect matching. An ear decomposition theorem (similar to the one for $2$-connected graphs) exists for bipartite matching covered graphs due to Hetyei. From the results and proofs of Lov\'asz and Plummer, that rely on Hetyei's theorem, one may deduce that any minimal bipartite matching covered graph has at least $2(m-n+2)$ vertices of degree two (where minimal means that deleting any edge results in a graph that is not matching covered); such a graph is said to be extremal if it attains the stated lower bound.
  In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the class of extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs. In particular, we prove that every such graph $G$ is obtained from two copies of a tree devoid of degree two vertices, say $T$ and $T'$, by adding edges -- each of which joins a leaf of $T$ with the corresponding leaf of $T'$.
  Apart from the aforementioned bound, there are four other bounds that appear in, or may be deduced from, the work of Lov\'asz and Plummer. Each of these bounds leads to a notion of extremality. In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization of all of these extremal classes and also establish relationships between them. Two of our characterizations are in the same spirit as the one stated above. For the remaining two extremal classes, we reduce each of them to one of the already characterized extremal classes using standard matching theoretic operations.</description>

      <title>What is the Modular Fourier Transform?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as an isomorphism of the group algebra of a cyclic group to its decomposition in terms of irreducible representations when the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the group. We describe the DFT when $p|n$ by factoring $x^N - 1$ over finite fields. For the symmetric group, the Fourier transform is implemented using representations, Specht modules $S^\lambda$ for partitions $\lambda$, and Maschke's theorem. In the modular case, we construct the Pierce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents $e_i$ in SageMath, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT.</description>

      <title>Near-Tight Bounds for 3-Query Locally Correctable Binary Linear Codes via Rainbow Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a binary linear code of block length $n$ that is locally correctable with $3$ queries against a fraction $\delta &gt; 0$ of adversarial errors must have dimension at most $O_{\delta}(\log^2 n \cdot \log \log n)$. This is almost tight in view of quadratic Reed-Muller codes being a $3$-query locally correctable code (LCC) with dimension $\Theta(\log^2 n)$. Our result improves, for the binary field case, the $O_{\delta}(\log^8 n)$ bound obtained in the recent breakthrough of (Kothari and Manohar, 2023) (arXiv:2311.00558) (and the more recent improvement to $O_{\delta}(\log^4 n)$ for binary linear codes announced in (Yankovitz, 2024)).
  Previous bounds for $3$-query linear LCCs proceed by constructing a $2$-query locally decodable code (LDC) from the $3$-query linear LCC/LDC and applying the strong bounds known for the former. Our approach is more direct and proceeds by bounding the covering radius of the dual code, borrowing inspiration from (Iceland and Samorodnitsky, 2018) (arXiv:1802.01184). That is, we show that if $x \mapsto (v_1 \cdot x, v_2 \cdot x, \ldots, v_n \cdot x)$ is an arbitrary encoding map $\mathbb{F}_2^k \to \mathbb{F}_2^n$ for the $3$-query LCC, then all vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^k$ can be written as a $\widetilde{O}_{\delta}(\log n)$-sparse linear combination of the $v_i$'s, which immediately implies $k \le \widetilde{O}_{\delta}((\log n)^2)$. The proof of this fact proceeds by iteratively reducing the size of any arbitrary linear combination of at least $\widetilde{\Omega}_{\delta}(\log n)$ of the $v_i$'s. We achieve this using the recent breakthrough result of (Alon, Buci\'c, Sauermann, Zakharov, and Zamir, 2023) (arXiv:2309.04460) on the existence of rainbow cycles in properly edge-colored graphs, applied to graphs capturing the linear dependencies underlying the local correction property.</description>

Abstract: Let $P$ be a $k$-colored set of $n$ points in the plane, $4 \leq k \leq n$. We study the problem of deciding if $P$ contains a subset of four points of different colors such that its Rectilinear Convex Hull has positive area. We provide an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for this problem, where the hidden constant does not depend on $k$; then, we prove that this problem has time complexity $\Omega(n \log n)$ in the algebraic computation tree model. No general position assumptions for $P$ are required.</description>

      <title>Maximum Degree in Random Hyperbolic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random hyperbolic graph, introduced in 2010 by Krioukov, Papadopoulos, Kitsak, Vahdat and Bogu\~{n}\'a, is a graph model suitable for modelling a large class of real-world networks, known as complex networks. Gugelmann, Panagiotou and Peter proved that for curvature parameter $\alpha &gt; 1/2$, the degree sequence of the random hyperbolic graph follows a power-law distribution with controllable exponent up to the maximum degree. To achieve this, they showed, among other results, that with high probability, the maximum degree is $n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha} + o(1)}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In this paper, we refine this estimate of the maximum degree, and we extend it to the case $\alpha \leq 1/2$: we first show that, with high probability, the node with the maximum degree is eventually the one that is the closest to the origin of the underlying hyperbolic space. From this, we get the convergence in distribution of the renormalised maximum degree. Except for the critical case $\alpha = 1/2$, the limit distribution belongs to the extreme value distribution family (Weibull distribution in the case $\alpha &lt; 1/2$ and Fr\'echet distribution in the case $\alpha &gt; 1/2$).</description>

      <title>The Central Spanning Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spanning trees are an important primitive in many data analysis tasks, when a data set needs to be summarized in terms of its "skeleton", or when a tree-shaped graph over all observations is required for downstream processing. Popular definitions of spanning trees include the minimum spanning tree and the optimum distance spanning tree, a.k.a. the minimum routing cost tree. When searching for the shortest spanning tree but admitting additional branching points, even shorter spanning trees can be realized: Steiner trees. Unfortunately, both minimum spanning and Steiner trees are not robust with respect to noise in the observations; that is, small perturbations of the original data set often lead to drastic changes in the associated spanning trees. In response, we make two contributions when the data lies in a Euclidean space: on the theoretical side, we introduce a new optimization problem, the "(branched) central spanning tree", which subsumes all previously mentioned definitions as special cases. On the practical side, we show empirically that the (branched) central spanning tree is more robust to noise in the data, and as such is better suited to summarize a data set in terms of its skeleton. We also propose a heuristic to address the NP-hard optimization problem, and illustrate its use on single cell RNA expression data from biology and 3D point clouds of plants.</description>

Abstract: By assuming a type of balance for length $\ell=87$ and non-trivial subgroups of multiplier groups of Legendre pairs (LPs) for length $\ell=85$, we find LPs of these lengths. We then study the power spectral density (PSD) values of m-compressions of LPs of length 5m. We also formulate a conjecture for Legendre pairs of lengths $\ell \equiv 0$ (mod 5) and demonstrate how it can be used to decrease the search space and storage requirements for finding such LPs. The newly found LPs decrease the number of integers in the range $\leq 200$ for which the existence question of LPs remains unsolved from 12 to 10.</description>

Abstract: A mixed lattice is a lattice-type structure consisting of a set with two partial orderings, and generalizing the notion of a lattice. Mixed lattice theory has previously been studied in various algebraic structures, such as groups and semigroups, while the more general notion of a mixed lattice remains unexplored. In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of mixed lattices and the relationships between the various properties, such as the one-sided associative, distributive and modular laws. We also give an alternative definition of mixed lattices and mixed lattice groups as non-commutative and non-associative algebras satisfying a certain set of postulates. The algebraic and the order-theoretic definitions are then shown to be equivalent.</description>

      <title>On the Circuit Diameter Conjecture for Counterexamples to the Hirsch Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit diameters of polyhedra are a fundamental tool for studying the complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is to show that the original counterexamples for the other variants, for bounded polytopes and using monotone walks, also do not transfer.
  Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these counterexamples. To resolve the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of certain $2$-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch counterexamples in Santos' work. For Todd's monotone Hirsch counterexample, we provide two alternative approaches. The first one uses sign-compatible circuit walks, and the second one uses the observation that Todd's polytope is anti-blocking. Along the way, we enumerate all linear programs over the polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch conjecture, while the remaining $7107$ satisfy the bound.</description>

      <title>Functors on relational structures which admit both left and right adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes several cases of adjunction in the homomorphism preorder of relational structures. We say that two functors $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ between thin categories of relational structures are adjoint if for all structures $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$, we have that $\Lambda(\mathbf A)$ maps homomorphically to $\mathbf B$ if and only if $\mathbf A$ maps homomorphically to $\Gamma(\mathbf B)$. If this is the case, $\Lambda$ is called the left adjoint to $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ the right adjoint to $\Lambda$. In 2015, Foniok and Tardif described some functors on the category of digraphs that allow both left and right adjoints. The main contribution of Foniok and Tardif is a construction of right adjoints to some of the functors identified as right adjoints by Pultr in 1970. We generalise results of Foniok and Tardif to arbitrary relational structures, and coincidently, we also provide more right adjoints on digraphs, and since these constructions are connected to finite duality, we also provide a new construction of duals to trees. Our results are inspired by an application in promise constraint satisfaction -- it has been shown that such functors can be used as efficient reductions between these problems.</description>

      <title>Complete non-ambiguous trees and associated permutations: new enumerative results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a link between complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) and permutations exhibited by Daniel Chen and Sebastian Ohlig in recent work. In this, they associate a certain permutation to the leaves of a CNAT, and show that the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly one CNAT is $2^{n-2}$. We connect this to work by the first author and co-authors linking complete non-ambiguous trees and the Tutte polynomial of the associated permutation graph. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures by Chen and Ohlig on the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs for various $k &gt; 1$, via various bijective correspondences between such permutations. We also exhibit a new bijection between $(n-1)$-permutations and CNATs whose permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$.

      <description>arXiv:2305.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to extend the scope of the Ehrhart theory to periodic graphs. We give sufficient conditions for the growth sequences of periodic graphs to be a quasi-polynomial and to satisfy the reciprocity laws. Furthermore, we apply our theory to determine the growth series in several new examples.</description>

      <title>Recognition of chordal graphs and cographs which are Cover-Incomparability graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set $V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and cographs which are C-I graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classes of graphs, which we call thick graphs, that have the vertices of a corresponding thin graph replaced by cliques and the edges replaced by cobipartite graphs. In particular, we consider the case of thick forests, which are a class of perfect graphs. Whereas recognising membership of most classes of thick graphs is NP-complete, we show that thick forests can be recognised in polynomial time. We consider two well-studied combinatorial problems on thick graphs, independent sets and proper colourings. Since finding the independence or chromatic number of a perfect graph is well known to be in polynomial time, we examine the complexity of counting all independent sets and colourings in a thick forest. Finally, we consider two extensions of our results to larger classes: thick triangle-free graphs and thick bounded-treewidth graphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that w.h.p the chromatic number $\chi$ of the square of $G_{n,p},p=c/n$ is asymptotically equal to the maximum degree $\Delta(G_{n,p})$. This improves an earlier result of Garapaty et al \cite{KLMP} who proved that $\chi(G^2_{n,p})=\Theta \left(\Delta(G_{n,p})\right)$.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f^{(r)}(n;s,k)$ be the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph not containing a subhypergraph with $k$ edges on at most $s$ vertices. Recently, Delcourt and Postle, building on work of Glock, Joos, Kim, K\"{u}hn, Lichev and Pikhurko, proved that the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-2} f^{(3)}(n;k+2,k)$ exists for all $k \ge 2$, solving an old problem of Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s (1973). Meanwhile, Shangguan and Tamo asked the more general question of determining if the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-t} f^{(r)}(n;k(r-t)+t,k)$ exists for all $r&gt;t\ge 2$ and $k \ge 2$.
  Here we make progress on their question. For every even $k$, we determine the value of the limit when $r$ is sufficiently large with respect to $k$ and $t$. Moreover, we show that the limit exists for $k \in \{5,7\}$ and all $r &gt; t \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Colouring graphs from random lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given positive integers $k \leq m$ and a graph $G$, a family of lists $L = \{L(v) : v \in V(G)\}$ is said to be a random $(k,m)$-list-assignment if for every $v \in V(G)$ the list $L(v)$ is a subset of $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ of size $k$, chosen uniformly at random and independently of the choices of all other vertices. An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is said to be a.a.s. $(k,m)$-colourable if $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(G \textrm{ is } L-colourable) = 1$, where $L$ is a random $(k,m)$-list-assignment. We prove that if $m \gg n^{1/k^2} \Delta^{1/k}$ and $m \geq 3 k^2 \Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$ and $k \geq 3$ is an integer, then $G$ is a.a.s. $(k,m)$-colourable. This is not far from being best possible, forms a continuation of the so-called palette sparsification results, and proves in a strong sense a conjecture of Casselgren. Additionally, we consider this problem under the additional assumption that $G$ is $H$-free for some graph $H$. For various graphs $H$, we estimate the smallest $m$ for which an $H$-free $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a.a.s. $(k,m)$-colourable. This extends and improves several results of Casselgren.</description>

      <title>Secure Total Domination Number in Maximal Outerplanar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a secure total dominating set of $G$ if $S$ is a total dominating set of $G$ and, for each vertex $u \not\in S$, there is a vertex $v \in S$ such that $uv$ is an edge and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is also a total dominating set of $G$. We show that if $G$ is a maximal outerplanar graph of order $n$, then $G$ has a total secure dominating set of size at most $\lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor$. Moreover, if an outerplanar graph $G$ of order $n$, then each secure total dominating set has at least $\lceil (n+2)/3 \rceil$ vertices. We show that these bounds are best possible.</description>

      <title>From approximate to exact integer programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate integer programming is the following: For a convex body $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, either determine whether $K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ is empty, or find an integer point in the convex body scaled by $2$ from its center of gravity $c$. Approximate integer programming can be solved in time $2^{O(n)}$ while the fastest known methods for exact integer programming run in time $2^{O(n)} \cdot n^n$. So far, there are no efficient methods for integer programming known that are based on approximate integer programming. Our main contribution are two such methods, each yielding novel complexity results.
  First, we show that an integer point $x^* \in (K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n)$ can be found in time $2^{O(n)}$, provided that the remainders of each component $x_i^* \mod{\ell}$ for some arbitrarily fixed $\ell \geq 5(n+1)$ of $x^*$ are given. The algorithm is based on a cutting-plane technique, iteratively halving the volume of the feasible set. The cutting planes are determined via approximate integer programming. Enumeration of the possible remainders gives a $2^{O(n)}n^n$ algorithm for general integer programming. This matches the current best bound of an algorithm by Dadush (2012) that is considerably more involved. Our algorithm also relies on a new asymmetric approximate Carath\'eodory theorem that might be of interest on its own.
  Our second method concerns integer programming problems in equation-standard form $Ax = b, 0 \leq x \leq u, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ . Such a problem can be reduced to the solution of $\prod_i O(\log u_i +1)$ approximate integer programming problems. This implies, for example that knapsack or subset-sum problems with polynomial variable range $0 \leq x_i \leq p(n)$ can be solved in time $(\log n)^{O(n)}$. For these problems, the best running time so far was $n^n \cdot 2^{O(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for matching cut problems in graphs without long induced paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph, a (perfect) matching cut is an edge cut that is a (perfect) matching. Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022, Algorithmica 2023) &amp; Feghali, Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (arXiv:2212.12317)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced $14$-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{15}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{19}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free $8$-chordal graphs (graphs without chordless cycles of length at least $9$), it is hard to distinguish between those without matching cuts (respectively, perfect matching cuts, disconnected perfect matchings) and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free $8$-chordal graphs. On the positive side, we show that, as for MC [Moshi (JGT 1989)], DPM and PMC are polynomially solvable when restricted to $4$-chordal graphs. Together with the negative results, this partly answers an open question on the complexity of PMC in $k$-chordal graphs asked in [Le, Telle (TCS 2022) &amp; Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (MFCS 2023)].</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle are solvable in polynomial time in graphs of bounded independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian path (a Hamiltonian cycle) in a graph is a path (a cycle, respectively) that traverses all of its vertices. The problems of deciding their existence in an input graph are well-known to be NP-complete, in fact, they belong to the first problems shown to be computationally hard when the theory of NP-completeness was being developed. A lot of research has been devoted to the complexity of Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle problems for special graph classes, yet only a handful of positive results are known. The complexities of both of these problems have been open even for $4K_1$-free graphs, i.e., graphs of independence number at most $3$. We answer this question in the general setting of graphs of bounded independence number.
  We also consider a newly introduced problem called \emph{Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage} which is related to the notions of a path cover and of a linkage in a graph. This problem asks if given $\ell$ pairs of vertices in an input graph can be connected by disjoint paths that altogether traverse all vertices of the graph. For $\ell=1$, Hamiltonian-1-Linkage asks for existence of a Hamiltonian path connecting a given pair of vertices. Our main result reads that for every pair of integers $k$ and $\ell$, the Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage problem is polynomial time solvable for graphs of independence number not exceeding $k$.</description>
