      <title>A Massera-type Theorem on relative-periodic solutions for a second-order model of rectilinear locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of a global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics of a discrete toy model for rectilinear crawling locomotion, corresponding to a limit cycle in the shape and velocity variables. The body of the crawler consists of a chain of point masses, joined by active elastic links and subject to smooth friction forces, so that the dynamics is described by a system of second order differential equations. Our main result is of Massera-type, namely we show that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of the global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics. In establishing this result, a contractive property of the dynamics of our model plays a central role. We then prove sufficient conditions on the friction forces for the existence of a bounded solution, and therefore of the attractor. We also provide an example showing that, if we consider more general friction forces, such as smooth approximations of dry friction, bounded solutions may not exist.</description>

      <title>Spike-Adding Mechanisms in a Three-Timescale Fast-Slow System: Insights from the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model with Periodic Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the spike-adding mechanism in a class of three-dimensional fast-slow systems with three distinct timescales, inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model driven by periodic input. First, we numerically generate a bifurcation diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and amplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the amplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. Next, we apply methods from geometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and super-critical manifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of new burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low frequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding mechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike counts in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Collinear Fractals and Bandt's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex parameter $c$ outside the unit disk and an integer $n\ge2$, we examine the $n$-ary collinear fractal $E(c,n)$, defined as the attractor of the iterated function system $\{\mbox{$f_k \colon \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$}\}_{k=1}^n$, where $f_k(z):=1+n-2k+c^{-1}z$. We investigate some topological features of the connectedness locus $\mathcal{M}_n$, similar to the Mandelbrot set, defined as the set of those $c$ for which $E(c,n)$ is connected. In particular, we provide a detailed answer to an open question posed by Calegari, Koch, and Walker in 2017. We also extend and refine the technique of the covering property by Solomyak and Xu to any $n\ge2$. We use it to show that a nontrivial portion of $\mathcal{M}_n$ is regular-closed. When $n\ge21$, we enhance this result by showing that, in fact, the whole $\mathcal{M}_n\setminus\mathbb{R}$ lies within the closure of its interior, thus proving that the generalized Bandt's conjecture is true.</description>

      <title>Thick Arnold tongues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a physically motivated problem that exhibits interesting and perhaps unexpected mathematical features. A cellular flow is a two-dimensional Hamiltonian flow of the Hamiltonian $H(x, y) = \cos(x) \cos(y)$. We study a simple model of the dynamics of an inertial particle carried by such a flow, subject to viscous drag and to an additional constant external force $(b, a)$. In the limiting case of zero inertia particles the dynamics is Hamiltonian with $H(x, y) = \cos(x) \cos(y) - ax + by$. For small but nonzero $a, \ b $ there appear ``channels" of trajectories that wind their way to infinity, of small relative measure, while most trajectories remain periodic.
  By contrast, for nonzero inertia, no matter how small, almost all particle trajectories drift to infinity. Moreover, the asymptotic direction of this drift no longer coincides with the direction of forcing, and rather becomes Cantor-like function of the forcing direction $a/b$, and with an unexpected feature: the plateaus of this function occupy a set of full measure. Moreover, the complement to this set has zero Hausdorff dimension. In a two-parameter representation (one parameter being the forcing direction $a/b$, the other the drag coefficient), this gives rise to Arnold tongues, the tongues corresponding to rational slopes of drift. However, unlike Arnold's example, the complement to the union of all tongues has zero measure. This is explained by the behavior of rotation number for monotone families of circle maps with flat spots.</description>

      <title>Advancing Mathematical Epidemiology and Chemical Reaction Network Theory via Synergies Between Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00488v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper reviews some key concepts in chemical reaction network theory and mathematical epidemiology, and examines their intersection, with three goals. The first is to make the case that mathematical epidemiology (ME), and also related sciences like population dynamics, virology, ecology, etc., could benefit by adopting the universal language of essentially non-negative kinetic systems as developed by chemical reaction network (CRN) researchers. In this direction, our investigation of the relations between CRN and ME lead us to propose for the first time a definition of ME models, stated in Open Problem 1. Our second goal is to inform researchers outside ME of the convenient next generation matrix (NGM) approach for studying the stability of boundary points, which do not seem suficiently well known. Last but not least, we want to help students and researchers who know nothing about either ME or CRN to learn them quickly, by offering them a Mathematica package "BootCamp", located at https://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns, including illustrating notebooks (and certain sections below will contain associated suggested notebooks; however, readers with experience may safely skip the bootcamp). We hope that the files indicated in the titles of various sections will be helpful, though of course improvement is always possible, and we ask the help of the readers for that.</description>

      <title>Thurston's pullback map, invariant covers, and the global dynamics on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rational maps $f$ on the Riemann sphere $\widehat {\mathbb{C}}$ with an $f$-invariant set $P\subset \widehat {\mathbb{C}}$ of four marked points containing the postcritical set of $f$. We show that the dynamics of the corresponding Thurston pullback map $\sigma_f$ on the completion $\overline{\mathcal{T}_P}$ of the associated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_P$ with respect to the Weil-Petersson metric is easy to understand when $\overline{\mathcal{T}_P}$ admits a cover by sets with good combinatorial and dynamical properties. In particular, the map $f$ has a finite global curve attractor in this case. Using a result by Eremenko and Gabrielov, we also show that if $P$ contains all critical points of $f$ and each point in $P$ is periodic, then such a cover of $\overline{\mathcal{T}_P}$ can be obtained from a $\sigma_f$-invariant tessellation by ideal hyperbolic triangles.</description>

      <title>Computational Bifurcation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifurcation analysis collects techniques for characterizing the dependence of certain classes of solutions of a dynamical system on variations in problem parameters. Common solution classes of interest include equilibria and periodic orbits, the number and stability of which may vary as parameters vary. Continuation techniques generate continuous families of such solutions in the combined state and parameter space, e.g., curves (branches) of periodic orbits or surfaces of equilibria. Their advantage over simulation-based approaches is the ability to map out such families independently of the dynamic stability of the equilibria or periodic orbits. Bifurcation diagrams represent families of equilibria and periodic orbits as curves or surfaces in appropriate coordinate systems. Special points, such as bifurcations, are often highlighted in such diagrams.
  This article provides an illustration of this paradigm of synergy between theoretical derivations and computational analysis for several characteristic examples of bifurcation analysis in commonly encountered classes of problems. General theoretical principles are deduced from these illustrations and collected for the reader's subsequent reference.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermi's Paradox using an Intragalactic Colonization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Fermi's Paradox via a system of differential equations and using simulations of dispersal and interactions between competing interplanetary civilizations. To quantify the resources and potentials of these worlds, three different state variables representing population, environment, and technology, are used. When encounters occur between two different civilizations, the deterministic Lanchester Battle Model is used to determine the outcome of the conflict. We use the Unity engine to simulate the possible outcomes of colonization by different types of civilizations to further investigate Fermi's question.
  When growth rates of population, technology and nature are out of balance, planetary civilizations can collapse. If the balance is adequate, then some civilizations can develop into dominating ones; nevertheless, they leave large spatial gaps in the distribution of their colonies. The unexpected result is that small civilizations can be left in existence by dominating civilizations in a galaxy due to those large gaps. Our results provide some insights into the validity of various solutions to Fermi's Paradox.</description>

      <title>Global bifurcation in a virus, defective genomes, satellite RNAs tripartite system: breakdown of a coexistence quasi-neutral curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of wild-type (wt) RNA viruses and their defective viral genomes (DVGs) have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This research has paid special attention to the interference effects of DVGs on wt accumulation, transmission, disease severity, and induction of immunological responses. This subject is currently a highly active. However, viral infections involving wt, DVGs and other subviral genetic elements, like viral RNA satellites (satRNAs) have received scarce attention. Satellites are molecular parasites genetically different from the wt virus, which exploit the products of the latter for their own replication in as much as DVGs do, and thus they need to coinfect host cells along with the wt virus to complete their replication cycle. Here, we analyze a mathematical model describing the initial replication phase of a wt virus producing DVGs and coinfecting with a satRNA. The model has three different dynamical regimes depending upon the wt replication rate ($\alpha$), the fraction of DVGs produced during replication ($\omega$), and the replication rate of the satRNA ($\beta$): ($i$) full extinction when $\beta &gt; \alpha (1 - \omega)$; ($ii$) a bistable regime with full coexistence governed by a quasi-neutral curve of equilibria and full extinction when $\beta = \alpha (1 - \omega)$; and ($iii$) a scenario of bistability separating full extinction from wt-DVGs coexistence with no satRNA when $\beta &lt; \alpha (1 - \omega)$. The transition from scenarios ($i$) to ($iii$) occurs through the creation and destruction of a quasi-neutral curve of equilibria in a global bifurcation that we name as \textit{quasi-neutral nullcline confluence} (QNC) bifurcation: at the bifurcation value, two nullcline hypersurfaces coincide, giving rise to the curve of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Optimal screening strategies in the control of an infectious disease: a case of the COVID-19 in a population with age structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw an increase in demand for epidemiological mathematical models. The goal of this work is to study the optimal control for an age-structured model as a strategy of quarantine of infected people, which is done via Pontryagin's maximum principle. Since quarantine campaigns are not just a matter of public health, also posing economic challenges, the optimal control problem does not simply minimize the number of infected individuals. Instead, it jointly minimizes this number and the economic costs associated to the campaigns, providing data that can help authorities make decisions when dealing with epidemics. The controls are the quarantine entrance parameters, which are numerically calculated for different lengths of isolation. The best strategies gives a calendar that indicates when the isolation measures can be relaxed, and the consequences of a delay in the start of the quarantine are analyzed by presenting the reduction in the number of deaths for the strategy with optimal control compared to a no-quarantine landscape.</description>

      <title>An alternating colouring function on strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternating colouring function is defined on strings over the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$. It divides the strings in colourable and non-colourable ones. The points in the subshift of finite type defined by forbidding all non-colourable strings of a certain length alternate between states of one colour and states of the other colour. In other words, the points in the 2nd power shifts all have the same colour. The number $K_n$ of non-colourable strings of length $n \ge 2$ is shown to be $2 \cdot (J_{n-2} + 1)$ where $J$ is the sequence of Jacobsthal numbers. The number of sources and sinks in the de Bruijn graph of dimension $n \ge 3$ with non-colourable edges removed is shown each to be $K_n - 4$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Mixing of invariant capacities and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of common conditional expectation to investigate Birkhoff's ergodic theorem and subadditive ergodic theorem for invariant upper probabilities. If in addition, the upper probability is ergodic, we construct an invariant probability to characterize the limit of the ergodic mean. Moreover, this skeleton probability is the unique ergodic probability in the core of the upper probability, that is equal to all probabilities in the core on all invariant sets. We have the following applications of these two theorems:
  $\bullet$ provide a strong law of large numbers for ergodic stationary sequence on upper probability spaces;
  $\bullet$ prove the multiplicative ergodic theorem on upper probability spaces;
  $\bullet$ establish a criterion for the ergodicity of upper probabilities in terms of independence.
  Furthermore, we introduce and study weak mixing for capacity preserving systems. Using the skeleton idea, we also provide several characterizations of weak mixing for invariant upper probabilities.
  Finally, we provide examples of ergodic and weakly mixing capacity preserving systems. As applications, we obtain new results in the classical ergodic theory. e.g. in characterizing dynamical properties on measure preserving systems, such as weak mixing, periodicity. Moreover, we use our results in the nonlinear theory to obtain the asymptotic independence, Birkhoff's type ergodic theorem, subadditive ergodic theorem, and multiplicative ergodic theorem for non-invariant probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Boolean function $f$ on $k$~bits induces a shift-invariant vectorial Boolean function $F$ from $n$ bits to $n$ bits for every $n\geq k$. If $F$ is bijective for every $n$, we say that $f$ is a proper lifting, and it is known that proper liftings are exactly those functions that arise as local rules of reversible cellular automata. We construct new families of such liftings for arbitrary large $k$ and discuss whether all have been identified for $k\leq 6$.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Analysis of Spike Self-Replication and Spike Nucleation of Reaction-Diffusion Patterns on Growing 1-D Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the asymptotic limit of a large diffusivity ratio, certain two-component reaction-diffusion (RD) systems can admit localized spike solutions on a 1-D finite domain in a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear regime. It is known that two distinct bifurcation mechanisms can occur which generate spike patterns of increased spatial complexity as the domain half-length L slowly increases; so-called spike nucleation and spike self-replication. Self-replication is found to occur via the passage beyond a saddle-node bifurcation point that can be predicted through linearization around the inner spike profile. In contrast, spike nucleation occurs through slow passage beyond the saddle-node of a nonlinear boundary-value problem defined in the outer region away from the core of a spike. Here, by treating L as a static parameter, precise conditions are established within the semi-strong interaction asymptotic regime to determine which occurs, conditions that are confirmed by numerical simulation and continuation. For the Schnakenberg and Brusselator RD models, phase diagrams in parameter space are derived that predict whether spike self-replication or spike nucleation will occur first as L is increased, or whether no such instability will occur. For the Gierer-Meinhardt model with a non-trivial activator background, spike nucleation is shown to be the only possible spike-generating mechanism. From time-dependent PDE numerical results on an exponentially slowly growing domain, it is shown that the analytical thresholds derived from the asymptotic theory accurately predict critical values of L where either spike self-replication or spike-nucleation will occur. The global bifurcation mechanism for transitions to patterns of increased spatial complexity is further elucidated by superimposing time-dependent PDE simulation results on the numerically computed solution branches of spike equilibria.</description>

      <title>On dense orbits in the space of subequivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first explain how to endow the space of subequivalence relations of any non-singular countable equivalence relation with a Polish topology, extending the framework of Kechris' recent monograph on subequivalence relations of probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.) countable equivalence relations. We then restrict to p.m.p. equivalence relations and discuss dense orbits therein for the natural action of the full group and of the automorphism group of the relation. Our main result is a characterization of the subequivalence relations having a dense orbit in the space of subequivalence relations of the ergodic hyperfinite p.m.p. equivalence relation. We also show that in this setup, all full groups orbits are meager. We finally provide a few Borel complexity calculations of natural subsets in spaces of subequivalence relations using a natural metric we call the uniform metric. This answers some questions from an earlier version of Kechris' monograph.</description>

      <title>A new form of asymptotic expansion for non-smooth differential equations with time-decaying forcing functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is focused on the asymptotic expansions, as time tends to infinity, of solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations with non-smooth nonlinear terms. The forcing function decays to zero in a very complicated but coherent way. We prove that every decaying solution admits an asymptotic expansion of a new type. This expansion contains a new variable that allows it to be established in a closed-form, but does not affect the meaning and precision of the expansion. Moreover, the expansion is constructed explicitly with the use of the complexification method.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data. Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Fractal Dimension as a Measure of Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02234</link>

Abstract: Bounding and predicting the generalization gap of overparameterized neural networks remains a central open problem in theoretical machine learning. There is a recent and growing body of literature that proposes the framework of fractals to model optimization trajectories of neural networks, motivating generalization bounds and measures based on the fractal dimension of the trajectory. Notably, the persistent homology dimension has been proposed to correlate with the generalization gap. This paper performs an empirical evaluation of these persistent homology-based generalization measures, with an in-depth statistical analysis. Our study reveals confounding effects in the observed correlation between generalization and topological measures due to the variation of hyperparameters. We also observe that fractal dimension fails to predict generalization of models trained from poor initializations. We lastly reveal the intriguing manifestation of model-wise double descent in these topological generalization measures. Our work forms a basis for a deeper investigation of the causal relationships between fractal geometry, topological data analysis, and neural network optimization.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.</description>
