      <title>Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Specifically, we focus on apolar active suspensions of squirmers, which are individually immotile but display activity-induced hydrodynamic diffusion. Under shear, the instantaneous particle velocities fluctuate more rapidly, similar to passive suspensions; however, surprisingly, the long-time diffusive dynamics can slow down and exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the shear rate. We show that this behavior arises from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced negative velocity autocorrelation, both of which are more pronounced at lower volume fractions. Simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence support this explanation and further offer a simple mechanism to understand the observed coupling. Our results reveal a generic effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics and a growing structural length scale in supercooled nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the relationship between structure and dynamics in supercooled binary Lennard--Jones nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes. The glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles is found to be significantly lowered relative to the bulk, decreasing as $N^{-1/3}$ with decreasing particle size. This allows the nanoparticles to sample low energy states on the potential energy landscape and we are able to study their relaxation times, measured in terms of the intermediate scattering function, and their structure, measured in terms of locally favoured structures, to low temperatures. Our work shows that the growing relaxation times in the supercooled nanoparticles are coupled with the growth of physical clusters formed from favoured local structures in a way that is well described by the Random First Order Transition entropic droplet model, but with exponents that are dependent on the nanoparticle size.</description>

      <title>Transients and multiperiodic responses: a hierarchy of material bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When cyclically driven, certain disordered materials exhibit transient and multiperiodic responses that are difficult to reproduce in synthetic materials. Here, we show that elementary multiperiodic elements with period T=2, togglerons, can serve as building blocks for such responses. We experimentally realize metamaterials composed of togglerons with tunable transients and periodic responses - including odd periods. Our approach suggests a hierarchy of increasingly complex elements in frustrated media, and opens a new strategy for rational design of sequential metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modelling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from inexpensive bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this Letter, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Topology Optimization of Pneumatic Soft Actuators Based on Porohyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.</description>

      <title>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in in vivo or in vitro populations of spiking neurons belong to different universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "critical brain hypothesis" posits that neural circuitry may be tuned close to a "critical point" or "phase transition" -- a boundary between different operating regimes of the circuit. The renormalization group and theory of critical phenomena explain how systems tuned to a critical point display scale invariance due to fluctuations in activity spanning a wide range of time or spatial scales. In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets &amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>
