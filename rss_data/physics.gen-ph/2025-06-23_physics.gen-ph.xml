      <title>CMB parity asymmetry from unitary quantum gravitational physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longstanding anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), including the low quadrupole moment and hemispherical power asymmetry, have recently been linked to an underlying parity asymmetry. We show here how this parity asymmetry naturally arises within a quantum framework that explicitly incorporates the construction of a geometric quantum vacuum based on parity ($\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) transformations. This elegant framework restores unitarity in quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). When applied to inflationary quantum fluctuations, this unitary QFTCS formalism predicts parity asymmetry as a natural consequence of cosmic expansion, which inherently breaks time-reversal symmetry. Observational data strongly favor this unitary QFTCS approach, with a Bayes factor, the ratio of marginal likelihoods associated with the model given the data $p\left( M\vert D \right)$, exceeding 650 times that of predictions from the standard inflationary framework. This Bayesian approach contrasts with the standard practice in the CMB community, which evaluates $p\left( D\vert M \right)$, the likelihood of the data under the model, which undermines the importance of low-$\ell$ physics. Our results, for the first time, provide compelling evidence for the quantum gravitational origins of CMB parity asymmetry on large scales.</description>

      <title>General Relativity as an EFT with emergent gravity via principle of spatial energy potentiality: implications for the standard model of cosmology</title>

Abstract: Recent developments demonstrate that General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory (EFT) with limited domain of validity, undergoing breakdown of fundamental symmetry in strong fields and exhibiting only one-loop finiteness in perturbative expansion. In this paper, we introduce the Principle of Spatial Energy Potentiality and develop a comprehensive theoretical framework wherein both time and gravity emerge from purely spatial, high-energy configurations through quantum-induced phase transitions. This framework reinterprets the Big Bang as a phase transition from 3D space to 4D spacetime, thereby avoiding traditional singularities and providing alternative early-universe dynamics. We present rigorous mathematical derivations including explicit loop calculations demonstrating how auxiliary parameters become physical time, detailed phase transition dynamics with bubble nucleation analysis, and comprehensive parameter space exploration with realistic energy scales. Modern dimensional regularization techniques reveal the mathematical structure underlying the 3D$\rightarrow$4D transition, showing how power-law divergences transform into logarithmic structures characteristic of emergent spacetime. We develop a thermodynamic analysis demonstrating how Gibbs free energy evolves from a purely enthalpic form in the spatial phase to include entropic contributions as the time arrow emerges. Our approach yields specific testable consequences including cosmic microwave background non-Gaussianities ($f_{NL} \sim 10-50$), gravitational wave backgrounds ($\Omega_{GW} h^2 \sim 10^{-8}-10^{-6}$), and Lorentz invariance violations ($\xi \sim 10^{-3}$), establishing multiple experimental validation pathways. We demonstrate explicit singularity resolution through finite curvature scalars and provide complete mathematical foundation for emergent spacetime dynamics.</description>
