      <title>Spectral conditions of pancyclicity for t-tough graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago Chv\'atal introduced a new graph invariant, which he called graph toughness. From then on a lot of research has been conducted, mainly related to the relationship between toughness conditions and the existence of cyclic structures, in particular, determining whether the graph is Hamiltonian and pancyclic. A pancyclic graph is certainly Hamiltonian, but not conversely. Bondy in 1976, however, suggested the "metaconjecture" that almost any nontrivial condition on a graph which implies that the graph is Hamiltonian also implies that the graph is pancyclic. We confirm the Bondy conjecture for t-tough graphs in the case when $t\in \{ 1;2;3\}$ in terms of the edge number, the spectral radius and the signless Laplacian spectral radius of the graph.</description>

      <title>2-distance 20-coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2-distance $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper $k$-coloring such that any two vertices at distance two or less get different colors. The 2-distance chromatic number of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a 2-distance $k$-coloring, denoted by $\chi_2(G)$. In this paper, we show that $\chi_2(G) \leq 20$ for every planar graph $G$ with maximum degree at most six, which improves a former bound $\chi_2(G) \leq 21$.</description>

      <title>Fusion inequality for quadratic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simplicial cohomology on a simplicial complex G deals with functions on simplices x in G. Quadratic cohomology deals with functions on pairs of simplices (x,y) in G x G that intersect. If K,U is a closed-open pair in G, we prove here a quadratic version of the linear fusion inequality. Additional to the quadratic cohomology of G there are five additional interaction cohomology groups. Their Betti numbers are computed from functions on pairs (x,y) of simplices that intersect. Define the Betti vector b(X) computed from pairs (x,y) in X x X with x intersected y in X a and b(X,Y) with pairs in X xY with x intersected y in K. We prove the fusion inequality b(G) &lt;= b(K)+b(U)+b(K,U)+b(U,K)+b(U,U) for cohomology groups linking all five possible interaction cases. Counting shows f(G) = f(K)+f(U) + f(K,U)+f(U,K)+f(U,U) for the f-vectors. Super counting gives Euler-Poincare sum_k (-1)^k f_k(X)=\sum_k (-1)^k b_k(X) and sum_k (-1)^k f_k(X,Y)=sum_k (-1)^k b_k(X,Y) for X,Y in {U,K}. As in the linear case, also the proof of the quadratic fusion inequality follows from the fact that the spectra of all the involved Laplacians L(X),L(X,Y) are bounded above by the spectrum of the quadratic Hodge Laplacian L(G) of G.</description>

      <title>Essential connectivity and spectral radius of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is trivial if it contains one vertex and no edges. The essential connectivity $\kappa^{\prime}$ of $G$ is defined to be the minimum number of vertices of $G$ whose removal produces a disconnected graph with at least two non-trivial components. Let $\mathcal{A}_n^{\kappa',\delta}$ be the set of graphs of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$ and essential connectivity $\kappa'$. In this paper, we determine the graphs attaining the maximum spectral radii among all graphs in $\mathcal{A}_n^{\kappa',\delta}$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs. In addition, we also determine the digraphs which achieve the maximum spectral radii among all strongly connected digraphs with given essential connectivity and give the exact values of the spectral radii of these digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of recurrence and transience for graphs over non-Archimedean ordered field. To do so we relate these graphs to random walks of directed graphs over the reals. In particular, we give a characterization of the real directed graphs which can arise is such a way. As a main result, we give characterization for recurrence and transience in terms of a quantity related to the capacity.</description>

      <title>On the total Italian domination number in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a finite simple digraph $D$ with vertex set $V(D)$. An Italian dominating function (IDF) on $D$ is a function $f:V(D)\rightarrow\{0,1,2\}$ satisfying every vertex $u$ with $f(u)=0$ has an in-neighbor $v$ with $f(v)=2$ or two in-neighbors $w$ and $z$ with $f(w)=f(z)=1$. A total Italian dominating function (TIDF) on $D$ is an IDF $f$ such that the subdigraph $D[\{ u\, |\, f(u)\ge 1\}]$ contains no isolated vertices. The weight $\omega(f)$ of a TIDF $f$ on $D$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}f(u)$. The total Italian domination number of $D$ is $\gamma_{tI}(D)=\min\{ \omega(f)\, |\, \mbox{$f$ is a TIDF on $D$}\}$.
  In this paper, we present bounds on $\gamma_{tI}(D)$, and investigate the relationship between several different domination parameters. In particular, we give the total Italian domination number of the Cartesian products $P_2\Box P_n$ and $P_3\Box P_n$, where $P_n$ represents a dipath with $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>The generalized Tur'{a}n number of long cycles in graphs and bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $T$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $\mathcal{F}$-free graph on $n$ vertices is called the generalized Tur\'{a}n number, denoted by $ex(n, T , \mathcal{F})$. When $T= K_2$, it reduces to the classical Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n, \mathcal{F})$.
  Let $ex_{bip}(b,n, T , \mathcal{F})$ be the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $\mathcal{F}$-free bipartite graph with
  two parts of sizes $b$ and $n$, respectively. Let $P_k$ be the path on $k$ vertices, $\mathcal{C}_{\ge k}$ be the family of all cycles with length at least $k$ and $M_k$ be a matching with $k$ edges.
  In this article, we determine $ex_{bip}(b,n, K_{s,t}, \mathcal{C}_{\ge 2n-2k})$ exactly in a connected bipartite graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G) \geq r\ge 1$, for $b\ge n\ge 2k+2r$ and $k\in \mathbb{Z}$, which generalizes a theorem of Moon and Moser, a theorem of Jackson and gives an affirmative evidence supporting a conjecture of Adamus and Adamus. As corollaries of our main result, we determine $ex_{bip}(b,n, K_{s,t}, P_{2n-2k})$ and $ex_{bip}(b,n, K_{s,t}, M_{n-k})$ exactly in a connected bipartite graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G) \geq r\ge 1$, which generalizes a theorem of Wang. Moreover, we determine $ex(n, K_{s,t}, \mathcal{C}_{\ge k})$ and $ex(n, K_{s,t}, P_{k})$ respectively in a connected
  graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G) \geq r\ge 1$, which generalizes a theorem of Lu, Yuan and Zhang.</description>

      <title>The coherent rank of a graph with three eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise graphs that have three distinct eigenvalues and coherent ranks 8 and 9, linking the former to certain symmetric 2-designs and the latter to specific quasi-symmetric 2-designs. This characterisation leads to the discovery of a new biregular graph with three distinct eigenvalues. Additionally, we demonstrate that the coherent rank of a triregular graph with three distinct eigenvalues is at least 14. Finally, we introduce a conjecturally infinite family of biregular graphs with three distinct eigenvalues, obtained by switching the block graphs of orthogonal arrays.</description>

      <title>Universal behaviour of majority bootstrap percolation on high-dimensional geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majority bootstrap percolation is a monotone cellular automata that can be thought of as a model of infection spreading in networks. Starting with an initially infected set, new vertices become infected once more than half of their neighbours are infected. The average case behaviour of this process was studied on the $n$-dimensional hypercube by Balogh, Bollob\'{a}s and Morris, who showed that there is a phase transition as the typical density of the initially infected set increases: For small enough densities the spread of infection is typically local, whereas for large enough densities typically the whole graph eventually becomes infected. Perhaps surprisingly, they showed that the critical window in which this phase transition occurs is bounded away from $1/2$, and they gave bounds on its width on a finer scale. In this paper we consider the majority bootstrap percolation process on a class of high-dimensional geometric graphs which includes many of the graph families on which percolation processes are typically considered, such as grids, tori and Hamming graphs, as well as other well-studied families of graphs such as (bipartite) Kneser graphs, including the odd graph and the middle layer graph. We show similar quantitative behaviour in terms of the location and width of the critical window for the majority bootstrap percolation process on this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Moment Method for Regular Graphs II: Discrete Trace Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish discrete trace formulas on a regular graph to relate its spectrum and non-backtracking walks. Our approach is based on the Chebyshev-type polynomials and we refer to this treatment as Chebyshev moment method. A key fact is that Chebyshev-type polynomials form a complete orthogonal basis with respect to the Kesten-McKay distribution. Based on this method, we further apply Cauchy's integral formula for holomorphic functions to prove the pre-trace formula for all regular graphs and the trace formula for finite regular graphs. We further apply our results to study the resolvent, heat and Schr\"odinger equations, Ihara zeta functions, and combinatorial enumeration problems on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Preserving and Increasing Symmetries of Polyhedral Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the question which local symmetry preserving operations can not only preserve, but also increase the symmetry of a polyhedral map. Often operations that can increase symmetry, can nevertheless not do so for polyhedral maps of every genus. So for maps that can increase symmetry, we also investigate for which genera they can do so. We give complete answers for operations with inflation factor at most 6 (that is: that increase the number of edges by a factor of at most 6) and for the chemically relevant Goldberg-Coxeter operations and the leapfrog operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spannning subgraph $F$ of $G$ is a $\{K_2,C_n\}$-factor if each component of $F$ is either $K_{2}$ or $C_{n}$. A graph $G$ is called a $(\{K_2,C_n\},n)$-factor critical avoidable graph if $G-X-e$ has a $\{K_2,C_n\}$-factor for any $S\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|=n$ and $e\in E(G-X)$. In this paper, we first obtain a sufficient condition with regard to isolated toughness of a graph $G$ such that $G$ is $\{K_2,C_{n}\}$-factor critical avoidable. In addition, we give a sufficient condition with regard to tight toughness and isolated toughness of a graph $G$ such that $G$ is $\{K_2,C_{2i+1}|i \geqslant 2\}$-factor critical avoidable respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a 2-regular graph and let $G$ be obtained from $H$ by gluing in vertex-disjoint copies of $K_4$. The "cycles plus $K_4$'s" problem is to show that $G$ is 4-colourable; this is a special case of the \emph{Strong Colouring Conjecture}. In this paper we reduce the "cycles plus $K_4$'s" problem to a specific 3-colourability problem. In the 3-colourability problem, vertex-disjoint triangles are glued (in a limited way) onto a disjoint union of triangles and paths of length at most 12, and we ask for 3-colourability of the resulting graph.</description>

      <title>Dynamical characterization of central sets in adequate partial semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the methods from topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notions of Central sets and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem which is the simultaneous extension of the van der Waerden and Hindman Theorem. Later N. Hindman and V. Bergelson found an equivalent formulation of Central sets in the set of natural numbers in terms of the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups. The general case was proved by H. Shi and H. Yang. Using the notions of ultrafilters, J. McLeod introduced the notions of Central sets for commutative adequate partial semigroups, however for noncommutative cases, Central sets can be defined similarly. In this article, introducing the notions of topological dynamics for partial semigroup actions, we find an equivalent dynamical characterization of central sets in partial semigroups\footnote{Recently in \cite{GTG}, authors attempted to do the same but in a different approach.}. Throughout our article, we follow the approach of N. Hindman and D. Strauss [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v Cech compactification: theory and applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin, 2012.].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinor-helicity formalism in particle physics gives rise to natural subvarieties in the product of two Grassmannians. These include two-step flag varieties for subspaces of complementary dimension. Taking Hadamard products leads to Mandelstam varieties. We study these varieties through the lens of combinatorics and commutative algebra, and we explore their tropicalization, positive geometry, and scattering correspondence.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative error correcting codes and proper subgroup testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Property testing has been a major area of research in computer science in the last three decades. By property testing we refer to an ensemble of problems, results and algorithms which enable to deduce global information about some data by only reading small random parts of it. In recent years, this theory found its way into group theory, mainly via group stability.
  In this paper, we study the following problem: Devise a randomized algorithm that given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, decides whether $H$ is the whole group or a proper subgroup, by checking whether a single (random) element of $G$ is in $H$. The search for such an algorithm boils down to the following purely group theoretic problem: For $G$ of rank $k$, find a small as possible test subset $A\subseteq G$ such that for every proper subgroup $H$, $|H\cap A|\leq (1-\delta)|A|$ for some absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$, which we call the detection probability of $A$. It turns out that the search for sets $A$ of size linear in $k$ and constant detection probability is a non-commutative analogue of the classical search for families of good error correcting codes. This paper is devoted to proving that such test subsets exist, which implies good universal error correcting codes exist -- providing a far reaching generalization of the classical result of Shannon.
  In addition, we study this problem in certain subclasses of groups -- such as abelian, nilpotent, and finite solvable groups -- providing different constructions of test subsets for these subclasses with various qualities. Finally, this generalized theory of non-commutative error correcting codes suggests a plethora of interesting problems and research directions.</description>

      <title>Counting of surfaces and computational complexity in column sums of symmetric group character tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The character table of the symmetric group $S_n$, of permutations of $n$ objects, is of fundamental interest in theoretical physics, combinatorics as well as computational complexity theory. We investigate the implications of an identity, which has a geometrical interpretation in combinatorial topological field theories, relating the column sum of normalised central characters of $S_n$ to a sum of structure constants of multiplication in the centre of the group algebra of $S_n$. The identity leads to the proof that a combinatorial computation of the column sum belongs to complexity class \shP. The sum of structure constants has an interpretation in terms of the counting of branched covers of the sphere. This allows the identification of a tractable subset of the structure constants related to genus zero covers. We use this subset to prove that the column sum for a conjugacy class labelled by partition $\lambda$ is non-vanishing if and only if the permutations in the conjugacy class are even. This leads to the result that the determination of the vanishing or otherwise of the column sum is in complexity class \pP. The subset gives a positive lower bound on the column sum for any even $ \lambda$. For any disjoint decomposition of $ \lambda$ as $\lambda_1 \sqcup \lambda_2 $ we obtain a lower bound for the column sum at $ \lambda$ in terms of the product of the column sums for $ \lambda_1$ and$\lambda_2$. This can be expressed as a super-additivity property for the logarithms of column sums of normalized characters.</description>

Abstract: The distance reducing property for Markov bases is an important property that provides a bound on the mixing time of the associated Markov chain. The goal of this project is to understand properties of distance-reducing Markov bases. We explore the distance reducing property for monomial curves and give a complete characterisation of distance reduction in the case of complete intersection monomial curves. Our characterisation carefully uses the notion of gluings for numerical semigroups. We also characterise the distance reducing property for non-complete intersection monomial curves in small dimensions. We also explore the distance irreducible elements: the moves that appear in all distance reducing Markov bases.</description>

Abstract: Graph matrices are a type of matrix which has played a crucial role in analyzing the sum of squares hierarchy on average case problems. However, except for rough norm bounds, little is known about graph matrices. In this paper, we take a step towards better understanding graph matrices by determining the limiting distribution of the spectrum of the singular values of Z-shaped graph matrices. We then give a partial generalization of our results for $m$-layer Z-shaped graph matrices.</description>

      <title>Shi arrangements and low elements in Coxeter groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$ and a nonnegative integer $m$, the $m$-Shi arrangement of $(W,S)$ is a subarrangement of the Coxeter hyperplane arrangement of $(W,S)$. The classical Shi arrangement ($m=0$) was introduced in the case of affine Weyl groups by Shi to study Kazhdan-Lusztig cells for $W$. As two key results, Shi showed that each region of the Shi arrangement contains exactly one element of minimal length in $W$ and that the union of their inverses form a convex subset of the Coxeter complex. The set of $m$-low elements in $W$ were introduced to study the word problem of the corresponding Artin-Tits (braid) group and they turn out to produce automata to study the combinatorics of reduced words in $W$.
  In this article, we generalize and extend Shi's results to any Coxeter system for any $m$: (1) the set of minimal length elements of the regions in a $m$-Shi arrangement is precisely the set of $m$-low elements, settling a conjecture of the first and third authors in this case; (2) the union of the inverses of the ($0$-)low elements form a convex subset in the Coxeter complex, settling a conjecture by the third author, Nadeau and Williams.</description>

Abstract: Let $f_r(k)$ be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\{1,2,...,n\}$ has a monochromatic solution to the nonlinear equation \[1/x_1+\cdots+1/x_k=1/y,\] where $x_1,...,x_k$ are not necessarily distinct. Brown and R\"{o}dl [Bull. Aust. Math. Soc. 43(1991): 387-392] proved that $f_2(k)=O(k^6)$. In this paper, we prove that $f_2(k)=O(k^3)$. The main ingredient in our proof is a finite set $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ such that every $2$-coloring of $A$ has a monochromatic solution to the linear equation $x_1+\cdots+x_k=y$ and the least common multiple of $A$ is sufficiently small. This approach can also be used to study $f_r(k)$ with $r&gt;2$. For example, a recent result of Boza, Mar\'{i}n, Revuelta, and Sanz [Discrete Appl. Math. 263(2019): 59-68] implies that $f_3(k)=O(k^{43})$.</description>

      <title>Maximum values of the edge Mostar index in tricyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the edge Mostar index of $G$ is the sum of $|m_u(e|G)-m_v(e|G)|$ over all edges $e=uv$ of $G$, where $m_u(e|G)$ denotes the number of edges of $G$ that have a smaller distance in $G$ to $u$ than to $v$, and analogously for $m_v(e|G)$. This paper mainly studies the problem of determining the graphs that maximize the edge Mostar index among tricyclic graphs. To be specific, we determine a sharp upper bound for the edge Mostar index on tricyclic graphs and identify the graphs that attain the bound.</description>

      <title>Enumerating pattern-avoiding permutations by leading terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of 123-avoiding permutation on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with a fixed leading terms is counted by the ballot numbers. The same holds for $132$-avoiding permutations. These results were proved by Miner and Pak using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence to connect permutations with Dyck paths. In this paper, we first provide an alternate proof of these enumeration results via a direct counting argument. We then study the number of pattern-avoiding permutations with a fixed prefix of length $t\geq1$, generalizing the $t=1$ case. We find exact expressions for single and pairs of patterns of length three as well as the pair $3412$ and $3421$. These expressions depend on $t$, the extrema, and the order statistics. We also define $r$-Wilf equivalence for permutations with a single fixed leading term $r$, and classify the $r$-Wilf-equivalence classes for both classical and vincular patterns of length three.</description>

Abstract: Complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) are combinatorial objects which appear in various contexts. Recently, Chen and Ohlig studied the notion of leaf permutation on these objects, and proposed a series of nice conjectures. Most of them were proved by Selig and Zhu, through a connexion with the abelian sandpile model. But one conjecture remained open, about the distribution of a natural statistic named determinant. We prove this conjecture, in a bijective way.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive generation of edge-girth-regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge-girth-regular graphs (abbreviated as $egr$ graphs) are a class of highly regular graphs. More specifically, for integers $v$, $k$, $g$ and $\lambda$ an $egr(v,k,g,\lambda)$ graph is a $k$-regular graph with girth $g$ on $v$ vertices such that every edge is contained in exactly $\lambda$ cycles of length $g$. The central problem in this paper is determining $n(k,g,\lambda)$, which is defined as the smallest integer $v$ such that an $egr(v,k,g,\lambda)$ graph exists (or $\infty$ if no such graph exists) as well as determining the corresponding extremal graphs. We propose a linear time algorithm for computing how often an edge is contained in a cycle of length $g$, given a graph with girth $g$. We use this as one of the building blocks to propose another algorithm that can exhaustively generate all $egr(v,k,g,\lambda)$ graphs for fixed parameters $v, k, g$ and $\lambda$. We implement this algorithm and use it in a large-scale computation to obtain several new extremal graphs and improvements for lower and upper bounds from the literature for $n(k,g,\lambda)$. Among others, we show that $n(3,6,2)=24, n(3,8,8)=40, n(3,9,6)=60, n(3,9,8)=60, n(4,5,1)=30, n(4,6,9)=35, n(6,5,20)=42$ and we disprove a conjecture made by Araujo-Pardo and Leemans [Discrete Math. 345(10):112991 (2022)] for the cubic girth 8 and girth 12 cases. Based on our computations, we conjecture that $n(3,7,6)=n(3,8,10)=n(3,8,12)=n(3,8,14)=\infty.$</description>

      <title>Gamma positivity of variations of $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977 Carlitz and Scoville introduced the cycle $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials $A^{\mathrm{cyc}}_n(x,y, t\,|\,\alpha)$ by enumerating permutations with respect to the number of excedances, drops, fixed points and cycles. In this paper, we introduce a nine-variable generalization of the Eulerian polynomials $A_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4, f, g, t\,|\,\alpha, \beta)$ in terms of descent based statistics of permutations and prove a connection formula between these two kinds of generalized Eulerian polynomials. By exploring the connection formula, we derive plainly the exponential generating function of the latter polynomials and various $\gamma$-positive formulas for variants of Eulerian polynomials. In particular, our results unify and strengthen the recent results by Ji and Ji-Lin. In related work to the transition matrix between the Specht and web bases, Hwang, Jang and Oh recently introduced the web permutations, which can be characterised by cycle Andr\'e permutations. We show that enumerating the latter permutations with respect to the number of drops, fixed points and cycles gives rise to the normalised $\gamma$-vectors of the $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials. Our result generalizes and unifies several known results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The unitary Cayley graph has vertex set $\{0,1, \hdots ,n-1\}$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $\gcd(u - v, n) = 1$. In this paper, we study periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on the unitary Cayley graphs. We characterize all periodic unitary Cayley graphs. We prove that periodicity is a necessary condition for occurrence of perfect state transfer on a vertex-transitive graph. Also, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on circulant graphs. Using these, we prove that only four graphs in the class of unitary Cayley graphs exhibit perfect state transfer. Also, we provide a spectral characterization of the periodicity of Grover walks on integral regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: Mutually intersecting varieties of a finite Desarguesian projective space are varieties with the same size, such that the intersection of two of them contains the same number of points. Here, we show the existence of a new family of mutually intersecting varieties by using certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q^2)$, where $q$ is any prime power. With the help of these quasi-Hermitian varieties we provide a new construction of $5$-dimensional MDS codes over ${\mathbb F}_q$ as well as an infinite family of simple orthogonal arrays $OA(q^{2n-1},q^{2n-2},q,2)$ of index $\mu=q^{2n-3}$.</description>

This formula would enable us to compute explicitly the quantum product of two arbitrary (opposite) Schubert classes in the (small) quantum $K$-theory ring $QK(Fl_{n})$ of the (full) flag manifold $Fl_{n}$ of type $A_{n-1}$ on the basis of the fact that quantum Grothendieck polynomials represent (opposite) Schubert classes in $QK(Fl_{n})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Shapley value equals a player's contribution to the potential of a game. The potential is a most natural one-number summary of a game, which can be computed as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition of the players. This computation integrates the coalition formation of all players and readily extends to games with externalities. We investigate those potential functions for games with externalities that can be computed this way. It turns out that the potential that corresponds to the MPW solution introduced by Macho-Stadler et al. (2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339--356) is unique in the following sense. It is obtained as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition, it generalizes the potential for games without externalities, and it induces a solution that satisfies the null player property even in the presence of externalities.</description>

Abstract: Version Control Systems, such as Git and Mercurial, manage the history of a project as a Directed Acyclic Graph encoding the various divergences and synchronizations happening in its life cycle. A popular workflow in the industry, called the feature branch workflow, constrains these graphs to be of a particular shape: a unique main branch, and non-interfering feature branches. Here we focus on the uniform random generation of those graphs with n vertices, including k on the main branch, for which we provide three algorithms, for three different use-cases. The first, based on rejection, is efficient when aiming for small values of k (more precisely whenever k = O($\sqrt$ n)). The second takes as input any number k of commits in the main branch, but requires costly precalculation. The last one is a Boltzmann generator and enables us to generate very large graphs while targeting a constant k/n ratio. All these algorithms are linear in the size of their outputs.</description>

Abstract: For finite classical groups acting naturally on the set of points of their ambient polar spaces, the symmetry properties of \emph{synchronising} and \emph{separating} are equivalent to natural and well-studied problems on the existence of certain configurations in finite geometry. The more general class of \emph{spreading} permutation groups is harder to describe, and it is the purpose of this paper to explore this property for finite classical groups. In particular, we show that for most finite classical groups, their natural action on the points of its polar space is non-spreading. We develop and use a result on tactical decompositions (an \emph{AB-Lemma}) that provides a useful technique for finding witnesses for non-spreading permutation groups. We also consider some of the other primitive actions of the classical groups.</description>

Abstract: The \textit{transition matrix} of a graph $\Gamma$ with adjacency matrix $A$ is defined by $H(\tau ) := \exp(-\mathbf{i}\tau A)$, where $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbf{i} = \sqrt{-1}$. The graph $\Gamma$ exhibits \textit{perfect state transfer} (PST) between the vertices $u$ and $v$ if there exists $\tau_0(&gt;0)\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lvert H(\tau_0)_{uv} \rvert = 1$. For a positive integer $n$, the group $V_{8n}$ is defined as $V_{8n} := \langle a,b \colon a^{2n} = b^{4} = 1, ba = a^{-1}b^{-1}, b^{-1}a = a^{-1}b \rangle$. In this paper, we study the existence of perfect state transfer on Cayley graphs $\text{Cay}(V_{8n}, S)$. We present some necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of perfect state transfer on $\text{Cay}(V_{8n}, S)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law for some fixed constant $C$. Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields. Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Graph Isomorphism, Coloring, and Distance Games</title>

Abstract: In quantum information, nonlocal games are particularly useful for differentiating classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations. An example of differentiation is given by the principle of no-collapse of communication complexity, which is often interpreted as necessary for a feasible physical theory. It is satisfied by quantum correlations but violated by some non-signalling ones.
  In this work, we investigate this principle in the context of three nonlocal games related to graph theory, starting from the well-known graph isomorphism and graph coloring games, and introducing a new game, the vertex distance game, with a parameter $D\in\mathbb N$, that generalizes the former two to some extent. For these three games, we prove that perfect non-signalling strategies collapse communication complexity under favorable conditions. We also define a refinement of fractional isomorphism of graphs, namely D-fractional isomorphisms, and we show that this characterizes perfect non-signalling strategies for the vertex distance game. Surprisingly, we observe that non-signalling strategies provide a finer distinction for the new game compared to classical and quantum strategies since the parameter D is visible only in the non-signalling setting.</description>
