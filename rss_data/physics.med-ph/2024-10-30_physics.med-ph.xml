      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger-Meitner electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event coincidence ion, electron time-of-flight and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger-Meitner decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger-Meitner electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology, which enables well-defined initial conditions, gas-phase, high activity introduction of Auger-Meitner emitters into the detection region, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities, which enables the simultaneous detection of many electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger-Meitner multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. As the multiplicities are binned by energy, this data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger-Meitner electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>

      <title>Photon-Counting CT in Cancer Radiotherapy: Technological Advances and Clinical Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) marks a significant advancement over conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT systems. This review highlights PCCT's superior spatial and contrast resolution, reduced radiation dose, and multi-energy imaging capabilities, which address key challenges in radiotherapy, such as accurate tumor delineation, precise dose calculation, and treatment response monitoring. PCCT's improved anatomical clarity enhances tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Additionally, metal artifact reduction (MAR) and quantitative imaging capabilities optimize workflows, enabling adaptive radiotherapy and radiomics-driven personalized treatment. Emerging clinical applications in brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) show promising outcomes, although challenges like high costs and limited software integration remain. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated radiotherapy packages, PCCT is poised to transform precision, safety, and efficacy in cancer radiotherapy, marking it as a pivotal technology for future clinical practice.</description>

      <title>First-in-human spinal cord tumor imaging with fast adaptive focus tracking robotic-OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current surgical procedures for spinal cord tumors lack in vivo high-resolution, high-speed multifunctional imaging systems, posing challenges for precise tumor resection and intraoperative decision-making. This study introduces the Fast Adaptive Focus Tracking Robotic Optical Coherence Tomography (FACT-ROCT) system,designed to overcome these obstacles by providing real-time, artifact-free multifunctional imaging of spinal cord tumors during surgery. By integrating cross-scanning, adaptive focus tracking and robotics, the system addresses motion artifacts and resolution degradation from tissue movement, achieving wide-area, high-resolution imaging. We conducted intraoperative imaging on 21 patients, including 13 with spinal gliomas and 8 with other tumors. This study marks the first demonstration of OCT in situ imaging of human spinal cord tumors, providing micrometer-scale in vivo structural images and demonstrating FACT-ROCT's potential to differentiate various tumor types in real-time. Analysis of the attenuation coefficients of spinal gliomas revealed increased heterogeneity with higher malignancy grades. So, we proposed the standard deviation of the attenuation coefficient as a physical marker, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas intraoperatively at a threshold. FACT-ROCT even enabled extensive in vivo microvascular imaging of spinal cord tumors, covering 70 mm * 13 mm * 10 mm within 2 minutes. Quantitative vascular tortuosity comparisons confirmed greater tortuosity in higher-grade tumors. The ability to perform extensive vascular imaging and real-time tumor grading during surgery provides critical information for surgical strategy, such as minimizing intraoperative bleeding and optimizing tumor resection while preserving functional tissue.</description>
