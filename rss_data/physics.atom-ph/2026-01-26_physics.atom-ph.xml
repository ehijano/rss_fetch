      <title>Bichromatic Tweezers for Qudit Quantum Computing in ${}^{87}$Sr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms have become a competitive platform for quantum metrology, simulation, sensing, and computing. Current magic trapping techniques are insufficient to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits encoded in hyperfine states with $J \neq 0$, compromising qudit coherence. In this paper we propose a scheme to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits via bichromatic tweezers. We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters. We expect this technique to enable new loading protocols, enhance cooling efficiency, and enhance nuclear spins' coherence times, thus facilitating qudit-based quantum computing in ${}^{87}$Sr in the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ manifold.</description>

      <title>Resonant X-Ray Difference-Frequency Seeding of Inner-Shell X-Ray Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a class of inner-shell x-ray laser systems in which the initial conditions of the emission are set by a resonant x-ray difference-frequency drive. Using a microscopic density-matrix framework, we show that two coherent x-ray fields at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with $\omega_1-\omega_2=\omega_0$, can induce a phase-locked coherence on a core-level transition at $\omega_0$ without requiring an external field or nonlinear susceptibility at that frequency. In the presence of population inversion, this driven coherence sets the phase and temporal onset of the amplified field, while gain remains governed by conventional inner-shell lasing mechanisms. We refer to this operating regime as a resonant x-ray difference-frequency laser (re-XDFL). The analysis demonstrates that difference-frequency-driven coherence provides a physically consistent route to controlled inner-shell x-ray laser emission beyond purely ASE-initiated operation.</description>

      <title>A Robust Strontium Tweezer Apparatus for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms for quantum computing applications show promise in terms of scalability and connectivity. We demonstrate the realization of a versatile apparatus capable of stochastically loading a 5x5 array of optical tweezers with single $^{88}$Sr atoms featuring flexible magnetic field control and excellent optical access. A custom-designed oven, spin-flip Zeeman slower, and deflection stage produce a controlled flux of Sr directed to the science chamber. In the science chamber, featuring a vacuum pressure of $3 \times 10^{-11}$ mbar, the Sr is cooled using two laser cooling stages, resulting in $\sim 3 \times 10^5$ atoms at a temperature of 5(1) $\mu$K. The optical tweezers feature a $1/e^2$ waist of 0.81(2) $\mu$m, and loaded atoms can be imaged with a fidelity of $\sim 0.997$ and a survival probability of $0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. The atomic array presented here forms the core of a full-stack quantum computing processor targeted for quantum chemistry computational problems.</description>

      <title>Shake-up and shake-off spectra in the electron capture decay of atomic $^7$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most stringent laboratory-based experimental limits on the existence of sub-MeV sterile neutrinos are currently set by decay spectroscopy of radioactive $^7$Be embedded into superconducting sensors. The systematic uncertainties are dominated by the modeling of the electron shake-up and shake-off spectra that are not based on state-of-the-art atomic theory and do not include electron correlations or relativistic effects. We have used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock formalism to obtain correlated wavefunctions ab initio and compute all single and double shake processes in the electron capture decay of atomic $^7$Be. The simulations can explain some but not all of the observed spectral features, likely because the wave functions are modified by the Ta sensor material that the $^7$Be is embedded into. The new models also show that the L/K electron capture ratio of $^7$Be in Ta has previously been slightly underestimated revising the previous value of 0.070(7) to a new value of 0.0756(20).</description>

      <title>Optimized Slice-Phase Control of Mirror Pulse in Cold-Atom Interferometry with Finite Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers require both high efficiency and robust performance in their mirror pulses under experimental inhomogeneities. In this work, we demonstrated that quantum optimal control designed mirror pulse significantly enhance interferometer performance by using novel adaptive sliced structure. Using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), optimized mirror pulse for a Mach-Zehnder light-pulse atom interferometer was designed by discretizing the control into non-uniform phase slices. This design broadened the tolerence to experimentally relevant variations in detuning $[-\Omega_0,\Omega_0]$ and Rabi frequency $[0.1\times\Omega_0,1.9\times\Omega_0]$ ($\Omega_0=2\pi\times25$ kHz), while maintaining high transfer efficiency even when the response-time delays up to 1.6 $\rm{\mu s}$. The optimized pulse was found to be robust to coupling inhomogeneity and velocity spread, offering a significant improvement in robustness over conventional pulse. The adaptive pulse slicing method provides a minimalist strategy that reduces experimental complexity while enhancing robustness and scalability, offering an innovative scheme for quantum optimal control in high precision atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.</description>

      <title>Engineering Near-Infrared Two-Level Systems in Confined Alkali Vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combined experimental and theoretical investigations of an effective two-level atomic system operating in the near-infrared telecom wavelength regime, realized using hot rubidium vapor confined within a sub-micron-thick cell. In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform. Our results establish a practical route to realizing near-infrared atomic two-level systems in compact vapor-cell devices, opening new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic technologies, including on-chip quantum memories, telecom-band frequency references, and scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of conformal field theory spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering discrete local dynamics in globally driven dual-species atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for engineering discrete local dynamics in globally-driven dual-species neutral atom experiments, allowing us to study emergent digital models through uniform analog controls. Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution.</description>

      <title>Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Proposal of a Digital Closed-Loop Thermal Atomic-Beam Interferometer for High-Bandwidth, Wide-Dynamic-Range, and Simultaneous Absolute Acceleration-Rotation Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal and simulation study of a digital closed-loop thermal atomic-beam interferometer for inertial navigation applications. The scheme synchronizes phase biasing with momentum-kick reversal through the atomic transit time, extracting four interferometric phases to suppress Raman beam path-length errors, while two-photon detuning feedback maintains a pseudo-inertial frame and eliminates cross-coupling. The interferometer enables simultaneous measurements of acceleration and rotation based on an absolute, atom-interferometric reference, with high bandwidth and a wide dynamic range. Numerical simulations verify that acceleration and angular velocity can be measured simultaneously and independently in real time without cross-coupling, demonstrating the absolute, decoupled nature of the proposed measurement scheme. We further evaluate the noise-limited performance of the sensor and obtain sensitivities of $3{\rm \mu m / s^2 / \sqrt{Hz}}$ (velocity random walk) and $15{\rm \mu deg / \sqrt{h}}$ (angular random walk) for a ${170}^{\circ}$ $^{85}$Rb beam and an interferometer arm length of 100~mm, surpassing the performance of sensors currently used in state-of-the-art inertial navigation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and electron-trajectory theory, but utilizes the perturbation expansion on the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. This expansion allows us to clearly differentiate the nonadiabatic and adiabatic effects on HHG. We show that the nonadiabatic effect relating to high-order expansion depends on the laser wavelength and remarkably enhances the HHG yields for cases of short wavelengths, providing deeper insights into wavelength-dependent HHG yields which are important in producing attosecond pulses. Especially, our method provides the analytical and accurate descriptions of nonadiabatic exit velocity and position of the tunneling electron at the tunnel exit. These descriptions are meaningful for constructing a fully analytical and quantitative Coulomb-included HHG model, which is crucial in HHG-based attosecond measurement.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Electronic Structure Theory: From Diatomic Lambda-Doubling to Macroscopic Einstein-de Haas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $\Lambda$-doubling energy splitting (or $\Lambda$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $\Lambda-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.</description>
