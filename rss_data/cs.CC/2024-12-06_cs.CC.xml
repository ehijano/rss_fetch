      <title>Recognizing 2-Layer and Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all drawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given graph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing minimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on one of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both variants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.
  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The $k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two layers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar graphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily be solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar graphs can also be recognized in linear time [Algorithmica 2015/2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time.
  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by showing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both problems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified.</description>

      <title>An even simpler hard variant of Not-All-Equal 3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Not-All-Equal 3-Sat remains NP-complete when restricted to instances that simultaneously satisfy the following properties: (i) The clauses are given as the disjoint union of k partitions, for any fixed $k \geq 4$, of the variable set into subsets of size 3, and (ii) each pair of distinct clauses shares at most one variable. Property (i) implies that each variable appears in exactly $k$ clauses and each clause consists of exactly 3 unnegated variables. Therewith, we improve upon our earlier result (Darmann and D\"ocker, 2020). Complementing the hardness result for at least $4$ partitions, we show that for $k\leq 3$ the corresponding decision problem is in P. In particular, for $k\in \{1,2\}$, all instances that satisfy Property (i) are nae-satisfiable.
  By the well-known correspondence between Not-All-Equal 3-Sat and hypergraph coloring, we obtain the following corollary of our results: For $k\geq 4$, Bicolorability is NP-complete for linear 3-uniform $k$-regular hypergraphs even if the edges are given as a decomposition into $k$ perfect matchings; with the same restrictions, for $k \leq 3$ Bicolorability is in P, and for $k \in \{1,2\}$ all such hypergraphs are bicolorable.
  Finally, we deduce from a construction in the work by Pilz (Pilz, 2019) that every instance of Positive Planar Not-All-Equal Sat with at least three distinct variables per clause is nae-satisfiable. Hence, when restricted to instances with a planar incidence graph, each of the above variants of Not-All-Equal 3-Sat turns into a trivial decision problem.</description>

      <title>NLTS Hamiltonians from good quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Constrained Boundary Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary labeling is a technique in computational geometry used to label dense sets of feature points in an illustration. It involves placing labels along an axis-aligned bounding box and connecting each label with its corresponding feature point using non-crossing leader lines. Although boundary labeling is well-studied, semantic constraints on the labels have not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we introduce grouping and ordering constraints in boundary labeling: Grouping constraints enforce that all labels in a group are placed consecutively on the boundary, and ordering constraints enforce a partial order over the labels. We show that it is NP-hard to find a labeling for arbitrarily sized labels with unrestricted positions along one side of the boundary. However, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms if we restrict this problem either to uniform-height labels or to a finite set of candidate positions. Finally, we show that finding a labeling on two opposite sides of the boundary is NP-complete, even for uniform-height labels and finite label positions.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Is uniform expressivity too restrictive? Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo &amp; al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</description>
