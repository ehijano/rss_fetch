      <title>Mu2e Straw Tube Tracker Gas Flow Quality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tracker gas flow quality control method developed for the Mu2e straw tube tracker. Using time-dependent current measurements, we quantify the onset time of ionization gain induced by an 55Fe source during gas exchange, which is correlated to the gas conductance in the straw. This allows for the identification of channels with inadequate flow. This approach is broadly applicable to other gaseous detectors that require high-channel-count screening.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Simulation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimization and Characterization of 7-pad Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10M{\Omega} resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200k{\Omega}) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of thin optical filters for high purity Cherenkov light readout from scintillating crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\sim 100~\rm \mu m$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.</description>

      <title>Progress towards a microchannel plate detector with AlGaN photocathode and cross-strip anode for ultraviolet astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microchannel plates (MCPs) were the driving detector technology for ultraviolet (UV) astronomy over many years, and still today MCP-based detectors are the baseline for several planned UV instruments. The development of advanced MCP detectors is ongoing and pursues the major goals of maximizing sensitivity, resolution, and lifetime, while at the same time decreasing weight, volume, and power consumption.
  Development efforts for an MCP-based detector system for the UV are running at IAAT at the University of T\"ubingen. In this publication, we present our latest results towards coating aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) photocathodes directly on MCPs, to improve quantum detection efficiency in the far- and extreme-UV. Furthermore, we report on the implementation of a non-iterative centroiding algorithm for our coplanar cross-strip anode directly in an FPGA.</description>

      <title>2bNIRS: a portable, multi-distance, broadband oximeter and cytochrome-c-oxidase monitoring system for in vivo applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instruments typically employ 2-3 wavelengths for monitoring tissue haemodynamics. However, the use of broadband illumination (hundreds of wavelengths) unlocks also the targeting of tissue metabolism by exploiting the wide differential-redox peak of absorption of cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). For this purpose, we present here a novel, broadband (780-900nm), multi-distance NIRS system, called 2bNIRS. Compact and portable (20 x 30 x 40 cm3), 2bNIRS was validated using a dynamic, optical phantom con-taining blood and yeast, and benchmarked against a multi-wavelength time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) system. Validation confirmed its accuracy in tracking haemody-namic and metabolic changes, with superior oximetry performance achieved via our BRUNO algorithm, which integrates broadband spectral fitting with spatially-re-solved analysis. Preliminary in vivo, human applications demonstrated 2bNIRS ap-plicability to monitoring both muscle tissue, during arm cuff occlusions, and the brain, during frontal cortex activation.</description>

      <title>Spaceflight KID Readout Electronics for PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optics-Enhanced Michelson Interferometer for Spectroscopy of Narrow-Band Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optics enables the deployment of interferometer-based spectroscopy without the need for moving parts necessary for scanning the interferometer arms. Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Signal Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms for Precise Timing with PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High particle rates in current and future experiments make pile-up phenomena a critical issue for extracting useful information. In this context, timing can be important as the 4$^{\mathrm{th}}$ dimension parameter for triggering or event reconstruction. The PICOSEC-Micromegas detector has been shown to offer precise timing of the order of tens of\,ps. In this work, novel signal processing algorithms are being developed and evaluated to demonstrate the technology's ability for online precise timing. We propose, an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This algorithm uses a model to train the ANN. The performance of the different algorithms is evaluated using experimental data, resulting in a timing resolution of 18.3 $\pm$ 0.6\,ps, comparable to the standard analysis based on the Constant Fraction Discrimination technique. Additionally, an alternative algorithm using the charge of the pulse exceeding a threshold as a parameter to correct for systematic effects is reported.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>
