      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing for Realized Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have demonstrated its potential to significantly enhance the analysis and forecasting of complex classical data. Among these, quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a particularly powerful approach, combining quantum computation with machine learning for modeling nonlinear temporal dependencies in high-dimensional time series. As with many data-driven disciplines, quantitative finance and econometrics can hugely benefit from emerging quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the application of quantum reservoir computing for realized volatility forecasting. Our model employs a fully connected transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian as the reservoir with distinct input and memory qubits to capture temporal dependencies. The quantum reservoir computing approach is benchmarked against several econometric models and standard machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using multiple error metrics and the model confidence set procedures. To enhance interpretability and mitigate current quantum hardware limitations, we utilize wrapper-based forward selection for feature selection, identifying optimal subsets, and quantifying feature importance via Shapley values. Our results indicate that the proposed quantum reservoir approach consistently outperforms benchmark models across various metrics, highlighting its potential for financial forecasting despite existing quantum hardware constraints. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the applicability of quantum computing in econometrics and financial analysis, paving the way for further research into quantum-enhanced predictive modeling as quantum hardware capabilities continue to advance.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrencies in the Balance Sheet: Insights from (Micro)Strategy -- Bitcoin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolving link between cryptocurrency and equity markets in the context of the recent wave of corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategies. We assemble a dataset of 39 publicly listed firms holding BTC, from their first acquisition through April 2025. Using daily logarithmic returns, we first document significant positive co-movements via Pearson correlations and single factor model regressions, discovering an average BTC beta of 0.62, and isolating 12 companies, including Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy, MSTR), exhibiting a beta exceeding 1. We then classify firms into three groups reflecting their exposure to BTC, liquidity, and return co-movements. We use transfer entropy (TE) to capture the direction of information flow over time. Transfer entropy analysis consistently identifies BTC as the dominant information driver, with brief, announcement-driven feedback from stocks to BTC during major financial events. Our results highlight the critical need for dynamic hedging ratios that adapt to shifting information flows. These findings provide important insights for investors and managers regarding risk management and portfolio diversification in a period of growing integration of digital assets into corporate treasuries.</description>

      <title>Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>
