      <title>Multimodal Fake News Video Explanation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal explanation involves the assessment of the veracity of a variety of different content, and relies on multiple information modalities to comprehensively consider the relevance and consistency between modalities. Most existing fake news video detection methods focus on improving accuracy while ignoring the importance of providing explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel problem - Fake News Video Explanation (FNVE) - Given a multimodal news containing both video and caption text, we aim to generate natural language explanations to reveal the truth of predictions. To this end, we develop FakeNVE, a new dataset of explanations for truthfully multimodal posts, where each explanation is a natural language (English) sentence describing the attribution of a news thread. We benchmark FakeNVE by using a multimodal transformer-based architecture. Subsequently, a BART-based autoregressive decoder is used as the generator. Empirical results show compelling results for various baselines (applicable to FNVE) across multiple evaluation metrics. We also perform human evaluation on explanation generation, achieving high scores for both adequacy and fluency.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study on how Multimodal LLMs' (MLLMs) reasoning ability shall be elicited to evaluate the aesthetics of artworks. To facilitate this investigation, we construct MM-StyleBench, a novel high-quality dataset for benchmarking artistic stylization. We then develop a principled method for human preference modeling and perform a systematic correlation analysis between MLLMs' responses and human preference. Our experiments reveal an inherent hallucination issue of MLLMs in art evaluation, associated with response subjectivity. ArtCoT is proposed, demonstrating that art-specific task decomposition and the use of concrete language boost MLLMs' reasoning ability for aesthetics. Our findings offer valuable insights into MLLMs for art and can benefit a wide range of downstream applications, such as style transfer and artistic image generation.

      <title>Multi-modal and Multi-scale Spatial Environment Understanding for Immersive Visual Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize the reverberant speech for the spoken content. The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation. The code and audio samples are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2SE-VTTS.</description>
