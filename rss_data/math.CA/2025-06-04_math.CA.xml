      <title>Weighted $L^2$ estimates with applications to $L^p$ problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish some weighted $L^2$ estimates for the Fourier extension operator in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and discuss several applications to $L^p$ problems. These include estimates for the maximal Schr\"odinger operator and the maximal extension operator, decay of circular $L^p$-means of Fourier transform of fractal measures, and an $L^p$ analogue of the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture.</description>

      <title>Stable invariant manifold for generalized ODEs with applications to measure differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the stable invariant manifold for a new kind of differential equations defined by Kurzweil integral, so-called {\em generalized ODEs} on a Banach space. The nonlinear generalized ODEs are formulated as $$ \frac{dz}{d\tau}=D[\Lambda(t)z+F(z,t)], $$ where $\Lambda(t)$ is a bounded linear operator on a Banach space $\mathscr{Z}$ and $F(z,t)$ is a nonlinear Kurzweil integrable function on $\mathscr{Z}$. The letter $D$ represents that generalized ODEs are defined via its solution, and $\frac{dz}{d\tau}$ only a notation. Hence, generalized ODEs are fundamentally a notational representation of a class of integral equations. Due to the differences between the theory of generalized ODEs and ODEs, it is difficult to extended the stable manifold theorem of ODEs to generalized ODEs. In order to overcome the difficulty, we establish a generalized Lyapunov-Perron equation in the frame of Kurzweil integral theory. Subsequently, we present a stable invariant manifold theorem for nonlinear generalized ODEs when their linear parts exhibit an exponential dichotomy. As effective applications, we finally derive results concerning the existence of stable manifold for measure differential equations and impulsive differential equations.</description>

      <title>Pugh's global linearization for the nonautonomous unbounded system with $\mu$-dichotomy via Lyapunov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical global linearization theorem for autonomous system given in [C. Pugh, Amer. J. Math., 91 (1969) 363-367] requires that nonlinear system with hyperbolicity satisfies boundedness and Lipschitz continuity.In this paper, we establish an {\em unbounded} global linearization theorem for nonautonomous systems subject to unbounded Lipschitz perturbations, under the assumption that the linear system admits a nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy (more general than classical exponential dichotomy). To this end, we first develop a comprehensive Lyapunov function framework for systems exhibiting nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy. Subsequently, we establish a characterization of nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy in terms of strict quadratic Lyapunov functions. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we then employ these Lyapunov functions to derive a linearization result under the nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy assumption. In the proof, we give a splitting lemma for nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy to decouple hyperbolic system into a contractive system and an expansive system. Then we construct a transformation to linearize contractive/expansive system, which is defined by the crossing time with respect to the unit sphere.</description>

      <title>Merryfield's inequality for multiparameter martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend an inequality of Merryfield, valid in the continuous setting, to discrete multiparameter martingales.
  As a consequence, we obtain the $L^p$ comparison of the maximal function with the square function:
  \begin{align*}
  E[(Sf)^p] \lesssim E[(f^*)^p]
  \end{align*}
  for regular multiparameter filtrations and $0 &lt; p &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Bessel and Riesz Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How large is the Bessel potential, $G_{\alpha,\mu}f$, compared to the Riesz potential, $I_\alpha f$? In this paper, we show that if $I_\alpha f\in L^p$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $p&gt;1$, then the following interpolation bound holds:
  \[\Vert G_{\alpha,\mu}f\Vert_p\leq C(\omega(I_\alpha f,1/\mu)_p)^\alpha\cdot\Vert I_\alpha f\Vert^{1-\alpha}_p.\] Here $\omega(f,t)_p$ is the $L^p$ modulus of continuity. However, if $\alpha=p=1$, we obtain the ``$L\log L$" type result \[\Vert G_{1,\mu}f\Vert_1\leq B\omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_1|\log\omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_1|.\] These and other estimates are obtained by studying the quotient of the two operators, $E_{\alpha,\mu}:=\frac{(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}{(\mu^2-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}$. This operator is of independent interest due to its connection to approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs under the assumption that the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, by a modified Picard iteration method. Then, we derive the comparison principle by analyzing associated linear BSDEs and further establish regularity results for the solutions. Finally, by combining the regularity results with a localization argument, we extend the well-posedness result to the case where $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. As applications, we derive nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of partial differential equations with Young drivers (Young PDEs), and further investigate BSDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficient functions, as well as linear stochastic heat equations subject to Neumann boundary conditions.</description>
