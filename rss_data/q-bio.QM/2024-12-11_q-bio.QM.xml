      <title>The Helicobacter pylori AI-Clinician: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence to Personalize H. pylori Treatment Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common carcinogenic pathogen worldwide. Infecting roughly 1 in 2 individuals globally, it is the leading cause of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer. To investigate whether personalized treatments would be optimal for patients suffering from infection, we developed the H. pylori AI-clinician recommendation system. This system was trained on data from tens of thousands of H. pylori-infected patients from Hp-EuReg, orders of magnitude greater than those experienced by a single real-world clinician. We first used a simulated dataset and demonstrated the ability of our AI Clinician method to identify patient subgroups that would benefit from differential optimal treatments. Next, we trained the AI Clinician on Hp-EuReg, demonstrating the AI Clinician reproduces known quality estimates of treatments, for example bismuth and quadruple therapies out-performing triple, with longer durations and higher dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) showing higher quality estimation on average. Next we demonstrated that treatment was optimized by recommended personalized therapies in patient subsets, where 65% of patients were recommended a bismuth therapy of either metronidazole, tetracycline, and bismuth salts with PPI, or bismuth quadruple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and bismuth salts with PPI, and 15% of patients recommended a quadruple non-bismuth therapy of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole with PPI. Finally, we determined trends in patient variables driving the personalized recommendations using random forest modelling. With around half of the world likely to experience H. pylori infection at some point in their lives, the identification of personalized optimal treatments will be crucial in both gastric cancer prevention and quality of life improvements for countless individuals worldwide.</description>

      <title>M$^{3}$-20M: A Large-Scale Multi-Modal Molecule Dataset for AI-driven Drug Design and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces M$^{3}$-20M, a large-scale Multi-Modal Molecular dataset that contains over 20 million molecules. Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit training or fine-tuning large (language) models with superior performance for drug design and discovery. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated by using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than the existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery. The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/bz99bz/M-3}.</description>

      <title>Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in South Asians: An Epidemiological and Anthropological Study in an Urban Populace of Eastern India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: This study examines cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors in an urban South Asian population, integrating medical and Anthropological perspectives to explore the effects of socio-economic, lifestyle, gender-specific factors, and cultural norms on health outcomes. Results: Analysis indicates a high prevalence of MetS and Pre-MetS, particularly among females, with significant predictors including BMI, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and waist circumference, alongside socio-genetic and lifestyle factors. Employing Elastic Net logistic regression, the researcher rigorously validated models to evaluate their predictive performance while also describing the associations and prevalence of known risk factors. The use of this method underlines the importance of combining traditional risk factors with socio-genetic, biological, economic and lifestyle variables, while Anthropological insights reveal the impact of urbanization and socio-cultural norms on health behaviors. Conclusion: The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach in public health strategies, emphasizing the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, biological and socio-cultural influences on cardiometabolic health. This dual approach aligns with descriptive and predictive model goals. The future research should further integrate biomedical sciences with socio-cultural studies to develop culturally sensitive interventions, aiming to address the growing challenge of CM diseases in urban South Asian contexts.</description>

      <title>Toward AI-Driven Digital Organism: Multiscale Foundation Models for Predicting, Simulating and Programming Biology at All Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach of using AI to model and simulate biology and life. Why is it important? Because at the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health, longevity, agriculture and food security, environmental protection, and clean energy, it is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to manipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this perspective, we layout an engineering viable approach to address this challenge by constructing an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), a system of integrated multiscale foundation models, in a modular, connectable, and holistic fashion to reflect biological scales, connectedness, and complexities. An AIDO opens up a safe, affordable and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting, simulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to individuals. We envision that an AIDO is poised to trigger a new wave of better-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle reasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life.</description>

      <title>Fast and exact simulations of stochastic epidemics on static and temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models on complex networks have been widely used to study how the social structure of a population affect the spreading of epidemics. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for epidemic spreading on both static and temporal networks. By systematic tests on artificial and real-world networks, we find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with million of nodes on a standard computer. It is also versatile enough to simulate a broad range of epidemic models of temporal networks, including cases in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. Our code is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. Because of these features, our algorithm constitutes an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>A multimodal ensemble approach for clear cell renal cell carcinoma treatment outcome prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: A reliable cancer prognosis model for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) can enhance personalized treatment. We developed a multi-modal ensemble model (MMEM) that integrates pretreatment clinical data, multi-omics data, and histopathology whole slide image (WSI) data to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for ccRCC patients. Methods: We analyzed 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) dataset, which includes OS, DFS follow-up data, and five data modalities: clinical data, WSIs, and three multi-omics datasets (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation). Separate survival models were built for OS and DFS. Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model with forward feature selection is used for clinical and multi-omics data. Features from WSIs were extracted using ResNet and three general-purpose foundation models. A deep learning-based CPH model predicted survival using encoded WSI features. Risk scores from all models were combined based on training performance. Results: Performance was assessed using concordance index (C-index) and AUROC. The clinical feature-based CPH model received the highest weight for both OS and DFS tasks. Among WSI-based models, the general-purpose foundation model (UNI) achieved the best performance. The final MMEM model surpassed single-modality models, achieving C-indices of 0.820 (OS) and 0.833 (DFS), and AUROC values of 0.831 (3-year patient death) and 0.862 (cancer recurrence). Using predicted risk medians to stratify high- and low-risk groups, log-rank tests showed improved performance in both OS and DFS compared to single-modality models. Conclusion: MMEM is the first multi-modal model for ccRCC patients, integrating five data modalities. It outperformed single-modality models in prognostic ability and has the potential to assist in ccRCC patient management if independently validated.</description>

      <title>Bi-level Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-Enhanced Molecule Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning is vital for various downstream applications, including the analysis and prediction of molecular properties and side effects. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called GODE, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. GODE integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, GODE effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, GODE surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Quantifying Compatibility Mechanisms in Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) involves complex compatibility mechanisms characterized by multi-component and multi-target interactions, which are challenging to quantify. To address this challenge, we applied graph artificial intelligence to develop a TCM multi-dimensional knowledge graph that bridges traditional TCM theory and modern biomedical science (https://zenodo.org/records/13763953 ). Using feature engineering and embedding, we processed key TCM terminology and Chinese herbal pieces (CHP), introducing medicinal properties as virtual nodes and employing graph neural networks with attention mechanisms to model and analyze 6,080 Chinese herbal formulas (CHF). Our method quantitatively assessed the roles of CHP within CHF and was validated using 215 CHF designed for COVID-19 management. With interpretable models, open-source data, and code (https://github.com/ZENGJingqi/GraphAI-for-TCM ), this study provides robust tools for advancing TCM theory and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of multiple ecDNA types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can drive oncogene amplification, gene expression and intratumor heterogeneity, representing a major force in cancer initiation and progression. The phenomenon becomes even more intricate as distinct types of ecDNA present within a single cancer cell. While exciting as a new and significant observation across various cancer types, there is a lack of a general framework capturing the dynamics of multiple ecDNA types theoretically. Here, we present novel mathematical models investigating the proliferation and expansion of multiple ecDNA types in a growing cell population. By switching on and off a single parameter, we model different scenarios including ecDNA species with different oncogenes, genotypes with same oncogenes but different point mutations and phenotypes with identical genetic compositions but different functions. We analyse the fraction of ecDNA-positive and free cells as well as how the mean and variance of the copy number of cells carrying one or more ecDNA types change over time. Our results showed that switching does not play a role in the fraction and copy number distribution of total ecDNA-positive cells, if selection is identical among different ecDNA types. In addition, while cells with multiple ecDNA cannot be maintained in the scenario of ecDNA species without extra fitness advantages, they can persist and even dominate the ecDNA-positive population if switching is possible.</description>

      <title>An inferential measure of dependence between two systems using Bayesian model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to quantify dependence between two systems $X$ and $Y$ in a dataset $D$ based on the Bayesian comparison of two models: one, $H_0$, of statistical independence and another one, $H_1$, of dependence. In this framework, dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in $D$, denoted $B(X,Y|D)$, is quantified as $P(H_1|D)$, the posterior probability for the model of dependence given $D$, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a measure of the evidence for dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as modeled by $H_1$ and observed in $D$. We review several statistical models and reconsider standard results in the light of $B(X,Y|D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using simulations, we focus on two specific issues: the effect of noise and the behavior of $B(X,Y|D)$ when $H_1$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of dependence. We then derive some general properties of $B(X,Y|D)$, showing that it quantifies the information contained in $D$ in favor of $H_1$ versus $H_0$. While some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid measure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired features for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We finally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the consequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and differences between $B(X,Y|D)$ and mutual information.</description>
