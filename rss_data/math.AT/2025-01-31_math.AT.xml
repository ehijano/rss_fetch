      <title>SeqSee: A schema-based approach to spectral sequence visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SeqSee, a software system that addresses spectral sequence visualization through a schema-based approach. By introducing a standardized JSON schema as an intermediate representation, SeqSee decouples the mathematical computations of spectral sequences from their visualizations. We demonstrate the system through a case study of the classical and C-motivic Adams spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of topological defects which wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory defined on a closed manifold $M$. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and the global structure of $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds $(M,F)$ where $F$ is Poincar\'e dual to some characteristic class. This concept is discussed in the mathematics literature, and shown here to have meaningful physical interpretations related to defects. In our examples we will mainly focus on the case where $M$ is 4-dimensional and $F$ has codimension 2. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls, to determine the conditions on which dimensions a higher-form finite symmetry can spontaneously break. We explicitly study the cases of higher-form $\mathbb Z/2$ symmetry, but the method can be generalized to other groups.</description>

      <title>Equivariant category of wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the formula \begin{equation*}
  \text{cat}_G(X\vee Y)=\max\{\text{cat}_G(X),\text{cat}_G(Y)\} \end{equation*} for the equivariant category of the wedge $X\vee Y$. As a direct application, we have that the wedge $\bigvee_{i=1}^m X_i$ is $G$-contractible if and only if each $X_i$ is $G$-contractible, for each $i=1,\ldots,m$. One further application is to compute the equivariant category of the quotient $X/A$, for a $G$-space $X$ and an invariant subset $A$ such that the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow X$ is $G$-homotopic to a constant map $\overline{x_0}:A\to X$, for some $x_0\in X^G$. Additionally, we also discuss the equivariant and invariant topological complexities for wedges. For instance, as applications of our results, we obtain the following equalities: \begin{align*}
  \text{TC}_G(X\vee Y)&amp;=\max\{\text{TC}_G(X),\text{TC}_G(Y),\text{cat}_G(X\times Y)\},
  \text{TC}^G(X\vee Y)&amp;=\max\{\text{TC}^G(X),\text{TC}^G(Y),_{X\vee Y}\text{cat}_{G\times G}(X\times Y)\},
  \end{align*} for $G$-connected $G$-CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$ under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>A distribution-guided Mapper algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: The Mapper algorithm is an essential tool to explore shape of data in topology data analysis. With a dataset as an input, the Mapper algorithm outputs a graph representing the topological features of the whole dataset. This graph is often regarded as an approximation of a reeb graph of data. The classic Mapper algorithm uses fixed interval lengths and overlapping ratios, which might fail to reveal subtle features of data, especially when the underlying structure is complex.
  Results: In this work, we introduce a distribution guided Mapper algorithm named D-Mapper, that utilizes the property of the probability model and data intrinsic characteristics to generate density guided covers and provides enhanced topological features. Our proposed algorithm is a probabilistic model-based approach, which could serve as an alternative to non-prababilistic ones. Moreover, we introduce a metric accounting for both the quality of overlap clustering and extended persistence homology to measure the performance of Mapper type algorithm. Our numerical experiments indicate that the D-Mapper outperforms the classical Mapper algorithm in various scenarios. We also apply the D-Mapper to a SARS-COV-2 coronavirus RNA sequences dataset to explore the topological structure of different virus variants. The results indicate that the D-Mapper algorithm can reveal both vertical and horizontal evolution processes of the viruses.

      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric bundles and related spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the equivariant and ordinary topological $K$-ring of a toric bundle with fiber a $T$-{\it cellular} toric variety. This generalizes the results in \cite{su} on $K$-theory of smooth projective toric bundles. We apply our results to describe the equivariant topological $K$-ring of a toroidal horospherical embedding.</description>
