      <title>Thermodynamic modifications to Bardeen black holes surrounded by quintessence based on the new higher order GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the thermodynamic properties of Bardeen black holes surrounded by quintessence are investigated in the framework of a new higher order GUP. The modified Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity are derived using a heuristic approach. Meanwhile, the remnant temperature and mass are deduced, and the modified black hole state equation is obtained by utilizing the energy density of matter. Ultimately, we analyze the effects of the GUP controlling deformation parameter $\beta$ on these thermodynamic properties using graphical illustrations, to more comprehensively understand the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole in the context of higher order GUP.</description>

      <title>Minimum asymptotic energy of a charged spherically symmetric thin-shell wormhole and its stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static spherically symmetric thin shell of proper mass $m$ and electric charge $q$ around a central star or black hole of mass $M$ is in general unstable. Although with fine-tuned $m,q,$ and $M$ it can be considered quasi-stable. These facts have been recently proved by Hod in \cite{HOD1} from which we are inspired to investigate the stability status of the throat of a spherically symmetric thin-shell wormhole (TSW) with the same proper mass and charge. Precisely, in this compact paper, we introduce the radius of stability for the throat of a static spherically symmetric charged TSW, by optimizing its energy measured by an asymptotic observer. Furthermore, we prove that at the stable equilibrium radius, the tension on the throat is zero, and a perturbation in the form of an initial kinetic energy results in an effective attractive potential such that the throat oscillates around the equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Accretion Disks: Turbulence, Mode Excitation and Prospects for Future Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational-wave emission by turbulent flows in accretion disks around spinning black holes or neutron stars. We aim to understand how turbulence can stochastically excite black hole quasinormal ringing and contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background from accretion disks around compact objects. We employ general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and feed them as the source of the Teukolsky master equation to evaluate the gravitational wave energy spectrum of a single source. The stochastic gravitational wave background from accretion disks generated by the population of stellar-mass compact objects is far below the sensitivity of third-generation ground-based detectors. In contrast, the supermassive black hole population, in particular those actively accreting, could lead to $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}\sim 10^{-15}$ in the microHertz. This signal remains well below the sensitivities of pulsar-timing-arrays and LISA, making direct observation infeasible.</description>

      <title>$f(T)$ Gravity: Background Dependence and Propagating Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, rooted in General Relativity (GR), has achieved remarkable success, yet it still faces unresolved issues like the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. These challenges might imply the need for alternative gravitational theories. Teleparallel gravity offers a compelling framework by reformulating the gravitational interaction using torsion, rather than curvature, as its fundamental geometrical property. This paper delves into $f(T)$ gravity, an extension of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which introduces non-linear modifications of the torsion scalar $T$. We focus on the role of spacetime-dependent Lorentz transformations in the vierbein formalism, examining their impact on both background solutions and perturbation dynamics. Special attention is given to the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime, as well as the anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime. Furthermore, the analysis of the propagating degrees of freedom on these spacetimes is performed. While it is well established that TEGR reproduces the same results as GR, the propagating degrees of freedom in its non-linear extension, $f(T)$ gravity, is still debated in the literature. In this work, we find that only two fields propagate in the gravity sector, independently of the background spacetime considered, either FLRW or Bianchi I. Although not definitive, this paper provides fresh insights into the issue of the propagating degrees of freedom in $f(T)$ gravity, opening the door to intriguing new directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of shift-symmetric black-hole spacetimes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of shift-symmetric Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories (theories in which only derivatives of the scalar field appear in the action). Utilizing Euclidean methods, we first analyze two specific cases that serve as foundational examples for the broader framework. We derive the general expression for entropy variation within this setting, for homogeneous spacetimes, demonstrating that both parity-preserving and parity-violating terms contribute to the entropy formula. Given the functional form of the coupling terms, the black hole entropy can be determined by integrating this relation with respect to the event horizon. Our general result is consistent with previously reported special cases in the literature. Notably, for particular constraints on the coupling functions, the entropy identically vanishes. Furthermore, we establish that homogeneous spacetimes within shift- and parity-symmetric beyond-Horndeski theories universally obey Bekenstein's Area Law for entropy, irrespective of the specific form of the coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures Induced by Dark Fluid Accretion in Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark fluid accretion on gravitational waveforms emitted by a compact binary system consisting of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass black hole. Using a Lagrangian framework with 1~PN and 2.5~PN corrections, we analyze the effects of the spherically symmetric accretion of a fluid with steady-state flow, including those characterized by an equation of state parameter resembling dark energy, on the binary's dynamics.
  We validate our approach by comparing it with previous studies in the common region of validity and extend the analysis to include both local effects, such as dynamical friction, and global gravitational interactions with the stellar-mass black hole, focusing on their dependence on the fluid's properties. Our analysis reveals that these interactions induce de-phasing in gravitational waveforms, with the phase shift influenced by the fluid's equation of state and energy density. We also extend the study to sudden cosmological singularities, finding that, although they can deform the binary's orbit from initially circular to elliptical, their effect on de-phasing is negligible for cosmologically relevant energy densities. By incorporating both the local and global gravitational interactions of a fluid on a two-body system into the equations of motion, this preliminary study provides a framework for understanding the interplay between fluid dynamics and gravitational wave emissions in astrophysical systems.
  It further reinforces the potential for probing the properties of astrophysically relevant fluids through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes in Lovelock with degenerated ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new regular black hole solution for Lovelock gravity with an \textit{n}-fold degenerate ground state AdS is provided. An alternative definition of the Kretschmann scalar for this theory is proposed, which is associated with the gravitational tension of the Schwarzschild vacuum AdS of this theory, which diverges at the radial origin. The proposed energy density encodes the latter's information in such a way that it takes a finite value at the origin, thereby suppressing the existence of a central singularity. There is a value of the extremal radius, $r_{ext}$, which can be of the order of the Planck length, such that for a value $r_* &gt; r_{ext}$, just slightly greater than it (also of the order of Planck), the solutions of the vacuum AdS black hole (BH) and our regular solution become indistinguishable. Thus, for realistic values of the horizon radius, both cases mentioned are numerically indistinguishable. However, at short length scales such that $r &lt; r_*$, both behaviors differ. Therefore, the proposed matter sources lead to the formation of a de Sitter core rather than a central singularity. The thermodynamics of both cases become indistinguishable for $r \geq r_*$, \text{i.e.}, for realistic scales. However, at shorter scales $r &lt; r_*$, quantum effects would arise, meaning that instead of the temperature evolving to infinity as in the vacuum AdS BH, the matter sources proposed in this work cause the cooling of the BH, through a phase transition, such that a BH remnant is reached at $T = 0$, which represents what remains of the BH once the evaporation process halts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmological Implications of the Modified Raychaudhuri Equation in Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the modified Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) in the context of Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy (NGVE) theory and its implications for various cosmological characteristics. The equation is formulated based on the NGVE framework, in which global scale invariance generates a unique geometry. The newly developed geometry introduces a metric that is conformally connected to the conventional metric, with the conformal factor dependent on scalar field potentials. The cosmological study is carried out under the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. Assuming matter behaves as an ideal fluid in the modified geometry, we formulate models for conditional expansion, collapse, and steady state, governed by the scalar field ($\phi$). In this context, the caustic solution and the focusing theorem are also studied. Scalar field solutions for exponential and power-law scale factors are also derived using NGVE theory's equations of motion. Finally, graphical analysis is used to investigate the behavior of the interaction terms that appear in the modified RE under these scale factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study, under a Gowdy symmetry assumption, nonlinear perturbations of the decelerated FLRW fluid solutions to the Einstein-Euler system toward the future for linear equations of state $p=K\rho$ with $0\leq K\leq 1$. This article builds on the work of Fajman et al. \cite{Fajman_et_al:2024} in which perturbations of the homogeneous fluid solution on a fixed, decelerating FLRW background were studied. Our numerical results show that for all values of $K$, perturbations of the FLRW solution develop shocks in finite time. This behaviour contrasts known results for spacetimes with accelerated expansion in which shock formation is suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a recently proposed one-to-one correspondence between quantum field theories in two-dimensional curved spacetime and quantum many-body systems, which enables the simulation of Hawking radiation in static background spacetimes. In particular, we demonstrate that deviations from the thermal spectrum, as predicted by the well-known tunneling method, can be observed in many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes in semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) black holes in semiclassical gravity by including in the field equations the expectation value of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor in the Polyakov approximation. We solve the field equations and the equations of motion self-consistently. This framework has previously been used to study vacuum solutions, i.e. quantum corrected Schwarzschild black holes. In our system, which contains black hole hair, we find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears and is replaced by a wormhole structure, similarly to what is found in vacuum. We also find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears, but there is no wormhole structure. Our results indicate that the inclusion of black hole hair in semiclassical gravity still leads to the disappearance of classical horizons for nonextremal black holes in static spherically symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Fock space states in static spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, sharp momentum states have to be normalized to be in Fock space. We investigate different normalization schemes, both box normalization and wave packets. These methods are equivalent in flat spacetimes, but turn out to produce different results in curved spacetimes, specifically in those that break translation invariance. This means that scattering processes have to be defined in relation to the normalization scheme used, rather than being independent of it as is the case in flat spacetime. We provide an illustrative example of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Scale Invariant Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A global scale-invariant Dark Energy model based on Induced Gravity with the addition of a small $R^2$ contribution is examined. The scalar field (quintessence), playing the role of Dark Energy, has a quartic potential and generates Newton's constant with its non-minimal coupling (after introducing a suitable symmetry breaking). Even when small, the $R^2$ contribution significantly modifies the cosmological evolution of the matter-gravity system. The solutions to this model are obtained analytically through a perturbative expansion and oscillate with transplanckian frequency. They are then compared with similar solutions found for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology plus $R^2$. Finally scalar field production is perturbatively taken into account in a simple model and the resulting effects illustrated.</description>

      <title>The shadow and accretion disk images of the rotation loop quantum black bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the shadow and observational image of the Kerr-like Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) inspired black bounce with the help of the celestial light source and the thin disk source by employing the backward ray-tracing method. The results indicate that both the LQG parameter alpha and the rotation parameter a contribute to a reduction in the shadow size; however, the influence of a is predominant, while the effect of alpha circular orbit. One can find that the correlation parameter (a, alpha), along with the observer's inclination angle, affect the image's asymmetry and the distortion of the inner shadow. As the inclination increases, the direct and lensed images diverge, creating a structure resembling a hat. Meanwhile, we also investigate the redshift distribution of the direct lensed images of the accretion disk under different parameters and observation angle. The results show that the distribution of redshift and observed intensity is obviously related to the behavior of accretion flow. These results may provide a potential approach to limit black hole parameters, detect quantum gravity effects, and distinguish the LQG black hole from other black hole models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Without Metric Quantization: From Hidden Variables to Hidden Spacetime Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bohmian mechanics offers a deterministic alternative to conventional quantum theory through well-defined particle trajectories. While successful in nonrelativistic contexts, its extension to curved spacetime-and hence quantum gravity-remains unresolved. Here, we develop a covariant extension of Bohmian mechanics in curved spacetime that removes the need for metric quantization. From a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a generalized guidance equation in which Bohmian trajectories generate hidden curvature, replacing metric superposition with a statistical ensemble constrained by Heisenberg uncertainty, offering a novel perspective on quantum gravity. Consequently, in our approach, measuring the gravitational potential at a point unveils a pre-existing trajectory and its associated curvature-a departure from the observer-centric paradigm of standard quantum mechanics-providing an alternative in which gravitational effects emerge from deterministic quantum trajectories rather than wavefunction collapse. Numerical simulations in Robertson-Walker and cigar soliton spacetimes reveal that while quantum interference is curvature-sensitive, Zitterbewegung remains invariant, distinguishing fundamental quantum effects. Moreover, deviations from the Born rule in inhomogeneous spacetimes are observed and suggest gravity-induced quantum non-equilibrium. This new approach has far-reaching implications for the role of determinism and potential observational signatures of quantum non-equilibrium in cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We explore a model of interacting Early Dark Energy (EDE) in which a minimally coupled scalar field, representing the EDE, interacts with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling function in the radiation-dominated era. This framework can be inspired by modified theories of gravity, including $f(R)$ gravity, the Einstein frame representation of Brans-Dicke theory, and chameleon gravity. Our findings reveal that the traditional law of radiation conservation is altered to $\rho_{\gamma}\propto a^{-4+\epsilon}$, where the parameter $\epsilon$ measures the rate of energy transfer between radiation and EDE. Assuming a constant energy transfer, we show that the scalar field behaves as $\phi\propto\ln a$, indicating that $\phi$ diverges as $a$ approaches zero. Additionally, we demonstrate that the interacting scalar-photon system behaves similar to an effective cosmological constant in the early stages of evolution of the Universe. Moreover, by solving the conservation equation associated with the scalar field, we derive an analytical expression for the ratio $r=\rho_{\phi}/\rho_{\gamma}$. Our results indicate that $r$ diminishes as the Universe expands, which is essential for a successful EDE model. Our investigation into the parameter space confirms that the expected behavior of $r$ during recombination aligns with contemporary cosmological data. These insights underscore crucial aspects necessary for any feasible EDE model and present exciting possibilities for resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Bridging time across null horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity, as a diffeomorphism-invariant theory, allows the description of physical phenomena in a wide variety of coordinate systems. In the presence of boundaries, such as event horizons and null infinity, time coordinates must be carefully adapted to the global causal structure of spacetime to ensure a computationally efficient description. Horizon-penetrating time is used to describe the dynamics of infalling matter and radiation across the event horizon, while hyperboloidal time is used to study the propagation of radiation toward the idealized observer at null infinity.
  In this paper, we explore the historical and mathematical connection between horizon-penetrating and hyperboloidal time coordinates, arguing that both classes of coordinates are simply regular choices of time across null horizons. We review the height-function formalism in stationary spacetimes, providing examples that may be useful in computations, such as source-adapted foliations or Fefferman-Graham-Bondi coordinates near null infinity. We discuss bridges connecting the boundaries of spacetime through a time hypersurface across null horizons, including the event horizon, null infinity, and the cosmological horizon.
  This work is motivated by the broader effort to understand the role of time in general relativity and reviews a unified framework for handling null boundaries in analytical and numerical approaches. The insights developed here offer practical tools for numerical relativity, gravitational wave astronomy, and other explorations of the large-scale structure of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Are Moduli Vacuum Expectation Values or Parameters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banks has argued that the moduli of string theory are not vacuum expectation values but parameters. We offer a different perspective on this question. Given two different points P and Q in the moduli space, we shall regard them as different vacua of the same underlying theory if in a theory where the asymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point P, we can perform an experiment that can determine the spectrum and S-matrix of a theory where the asymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point Q. We argue that in asymptotically flat space-time, this can be achieved by taking a charged black hole in the limit of large mass and charges. In this limit the local geometry at any point outside the horizon is indistinguishable from flat space-time. However the moduli vary slowly over the entire region so that their values at faraway points can differ by order unity. Therefore, by sending out experimental teams to different regions outside the horizon, an asymptotic observer can measure the spectrum and S-matrix for different values of the moduli.</description>

      <title>Building Neutron Stars with the MUSES Calculation Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. We present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. Using the Synthesis module, we match the three equations of state using different thermodynamic variables and different methods. We then couple the complete equation of state to a novel full-general-relativity solver (QLIMR) module that calculates neutron star properties. We find that the matching performed using different thermodynamic variables affects differently the range obtained for neutron star masses and radii (although never beyond a few percent difference). We also investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, we use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</description>

      <title>Vector mesons from a holographic QCD model in $f(R)$-dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the spectrum of vector mesons based on $f(R)$-dilaton gravity. We focus particularly on the well-known Starobinsky model, given by the function $f(R)= R+ \alpha R^2$ in the metric formalism, and we examine the deviations from the pure Einstein-dilaton case. We thus provide the field equations for Starobinsky-dilaton gravity in $\rm AdS_{5}$ spacetime and calculate the spectral decomposition of the vector mesons by means of a Sturm-Liouville problem. Remarkably, for the rho mesons $m_{\rho^2}$ and $m_{\rho^3}$, our results are in good agreement with the experimental data when $\alpha= 10^{-8}$. Our work also generalizes previous studies and recovers standard results when $\alpha= 0$.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

Abstract: We analyze some aspects of the cubic action for gravity recently proposed by Cheung and Remmen, which is a particular instance of a first order (Palatini) action. In this approach both the spacetime metric and the connection are treated as independent fields. We discuss its BRST invariance and compute explicitly the one-loop contribution of quantum fluctuations around flat space, checking that the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identities are fulfilled. Finally, our results on a first order action are compared with the existing ones corresponding to a second order action.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as cosmological proxies: estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in cosmology is the Hubble tension, a discrepancy in the predicted expansion rate of the Universe. We leverage the sensitivity of the Dispersion Measure (DM) from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Hubble factor to investigate the Hubble tension. We build a catalog of 98 localized FRBs and an independent mock catalog and employ 3 methods to calculate the best value of the $H_0$: i) the mean of $H_0$ values obtained through direct calculation, ii) the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and iii) the reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history $H(z)$ using two DM-$z$ relations. When the confirmed FRBs is employed, our predictions are compatible with reports from the Planck+2018, with $H_0=65.13\pm2.52\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $57.67\pm11.99\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for MLE and the arithmetic mean, respectively. If we assume a linear and a power-law function for the DM-$z$ relation, our predictions for $H_0$ are $51.27^{+3.80}_{-3.31}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $77.09^{+8.89}_{-7.64}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively. Using 100 mock catalogs of simulated FRBs, we obtain larger values for $H_0$ with all methods considered: $H_{0;\text{ Like}}=67.30\pm0.91\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Mean}}=66.21\pm3.46\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Median}}=66.10\pm1.89\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{Linear}}=54.34\pm1.57\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_{0;\text{Power-law}}=91.84\pm1.82\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for the MLE, the arithmetic mean, and linear and power-law $\text{DM}-z$ relations, respectively. Our results for mock FRB catalogs increase the statistical precision, ranging from 1.4\% to 5.2\% for the MLE and arithmetic mean. Our result with the MLE applied to synthetic FRBs is at the same level of precision as reports from SH0ES. The increase in the number of confirmed FRBs will provide us, in combination with other observations, a robust prediction of the value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a General Relativity University Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective physics learning, especially in complex topics, requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality, and using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. This study explores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex topics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. Our investigation, conducted at the University of Cagliari, assessed how students structure their problem framing and its impact on their conceptual learning of GR. Results indicate that students who blend conceptual understanding with mathematical formalism show a deeper grasp of physical principles and improved problem-solving skills. The research highlights the importance of symbol sense and the cyclical nature of problem framing, suggesting that a more integrated approach, incorporating visual, symbolic, and natural language elements, could enhance students' conceptual understanding. Additionally, the methodology provides instructors with insights into students' thought processes, enabling more effective, targeted feedback.</description>

      <title>Length-preserving biconnection gravity and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a length-preserving biconnection gravitational theory, inspired by information geometry, which extends general relativity by using the mutual curvature as the fundamental object describing gravity. The two connections used to build up the theory are the Schr\"{o}dinger connection, and its dual. It can be seen that the dual of a non-metric Schr\"odinger connection possesses torsion, even if the Schr\"odinger connection itself does not, and consequently the pair $(M,g,\nabla^{*})$ is a quasi-statistical manifold. The field equations are postulated to have the form of the standard Einstein equations, but with the Ricci tensor- and scalar replaced with the mutual curvature tensor- and scalar, resulting in additional torsion-dependent terms. The covariant divergence of the matter energy-momentum does not vanish in this theory. We derive the equation of motion for massive particles, which shows the presence of an extra force. The Newtonian limit of the equations of motion is also considered. We explore the cosmological implications by deriving the generalized Friedmann equations for the FLRW geometry. They contain additional terms that can be interpreted as describing an effective, geometric type dark energy. We examine two cosmological models: one with conserved matter, and one where dark energy and pressure are related by a linear equation of state. The predictions of both models are compared with a set of observational values of the Hubble function, and with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Length-preserving biconnection gravity models fit well the observational data, and also align with $\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts $(z&lt;3)$. The obtained results suggest that a modified biconnection geometry could explain the late-time acceleration, as well as the formation of the supermassive black holes, since they predict a different age of our Universe as compared to standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Overcharging a nonsingular black hole in general relativity: the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ay\'on-Beato Garc\'ia (ABG) solution describes a nonlinear electrodynamic nonsingular black hole in general relativity and can be regarded as a strong field correction to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution. We exam the possibility of destroying the ABG nonsingular black hole with a test charged particle and a complex scalar field. By comparing with the results of gadenken experiment to destroy the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, we get the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects on the destruction of the event horizon. We obtain the parameter regions of the particle and scalar field, which allow us to destroy the event horizon of an extremal and near-extremal ABG black hole. Our findings show that both can be destroyed due to nonlinear electrodynamic effects. Interestingly, the parameter intervals for the charged particle and scalar field needed to destroy the event horizon of an extremal black hole are identical. Since the ABG black hole is nonsingular, our results remain consistent with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and may offer a means to explore the interior of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model. Also, we investigate the stability of the solution with the MIT bag equation of state in this context of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>The precession of particle spin in spherical symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we will explore the precession of particle spins in spherical spacetimes. We first argue that the geometrical optics (WKB) approximation is insufficient, due to the absence of a glory spot in the backward scattering of massless particles, making an analysis of spin precession necessary. We then derive the precession equation assuming the spin is parallel transported, which is supported by the sub-leading order of the WKB approximation. The precession equation applies to both massless and massive particles. For particles moving at the speed of light, we show that spin is always reversed after backward scattering in any spherically symmetric spacetime, confirming the absence of a glory spot for massless particles. Finally, we solve the precession equation for Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes and discuss the spin precession of massive particles, particularly in the non-relativistic limit. We find that, in Schwarzschild spacetime, the spin precession for particles moving with very small velocities compared to the speed of light depends only on the deflection angle, while in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, it also depends on the black hole charge, as revealed by the expansion derived from the strong lensing approximation.</description>

Abstract: Black holes are the fascinating objects in the universe. They represent extreme deformations in spacetime geometry. Here, we construct f(P) gravity and the first example of static-spherically symmetric black hole solution in f(P) gravity and discuss their thermodynamics. Using the numerical approach and series solution, we discover the solution and demonstrate that it is a generalization of Schwarzschild. The solution is characterized by a single function that satisfies a nonlinear fourth order differential equation. Interestingly, we can analytically calculate the solution s specific heat, Wald entropy, and Hawking temperature as a function of horizon radius. After analyzing the specific heat, we discovered that the black hole is thermodynamically stable over a small horizon radius.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in massive gravity: Waveforms generated by a particle plunging into a black hole and the excitation of quasinormal modes and quasibound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim of testing massive gravity in the context of black hole physics, we investigate the gravitational radiation emitted by a massive particle plunging into a Schwarzschild black hole from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit. To do so, we first construct the quasinormal and quasibound resonance spectra of the spin-2 massive field for odd and even parity. Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and study their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret important phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of quasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay of the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic resonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the plunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the particle living on the innermost stable circular orbit, and (iii) the regularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement. Finally, we construct, for arbitrary directions of observation and, in particular, outside the orbital plane of the plunging particle, the regularized multipolar waveforms, i.e., the waveforms constructed by summing over partial waveforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $N$ clones of the quantized world, interacting with each other via quantum gravity, coupled by the downscaled Newton constant $G/N$. In the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain the semiclassical Einstein equation for every single cloneworld. In the non-relativistic limit, De Filippo had already obtained the semiclassical Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, we present an alternative elementary proof. In the general relativistic case we complete the semi-finished derivation of Hartle and Horowitz. We compare our simple correlated cloneworlds with Stamp's more complicated proposal of correlated worldlines and show why they differ despite the conceptual similarity.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms Behind the Aschenbach Effect in Non-Rotating Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that a rotating black hole drags the spacetime due to its spin. This effect can influence the motion of nearby objects, causing them to either fall into the black hole or orbit around it. In classical Newtonian mechanics, as the radius of the orbit increases, the angular velocity of an object in a stable circular orbit decreases. However, Aschenbach discovered that for a hypothetical non-rotating observer, contrary to usual behavior, the angular velocity increases with radius in certain regions. Although the possibility of observing rare and less probable rotational behaviors in a rotating structure is not unlikely or impossible. However, observing such behaviors in a static structure is not only intriguing but also thought-provoking, as it raises questions about the factors that might play a role in such phenomena. In seeking answers to this question, various static models, particularly in the context of nonlinear fields, were examined, with some results presented as examples in the article. Among the models studied, the model of Magnetic Black Holes in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Massive Gravity Coupled to Nonlinear Electrodynamics (M-EGB-Massive) appears to be a candidate for this phenomenon. In the analysis section, we will discuss the commonalities of this model with previous models that have exhibited this phenomenon and examine the cause of this phenomenon. Finally, we will state whether this phenomenon is observable in other black holes and, if not, why</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

      <title>Violations of the null convergence condition in kinematical transitions between singular and regular black holes, horizonless compact objects, and bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do regular black holes evade the Penrose singularity theorem? Various models of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence condition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must generically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the Penrose theorem. In fact, the Penrose singularity theorem depends on subtle global assumptions and does not provide information about where and when the singularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached at finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the region inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically, the Bardeen, Dymnikova, Hayward models of stationary regular black holes feature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence violating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and furthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of gravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing kinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black holes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon -- when present -- need not act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the NCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions. Our detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such kinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect the NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce spacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC is always violated. These findings offer new insights into how regular black holes and related objects evade the constraints imposed by the Penrose singularity theorem.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Probing modified gravitational-wave propagation with extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), namely binary systems composed of a massive black hole and a compact stellar-mass object, are anticipated to be among the gravitational wave (GW) sources detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Similarly to compact binary mergers detected by current GW detectors, EMRIs can be used as cosmic rulers to probe the expansion of the Universe. Motivated by tensions in current cosmological observations as well as by alternative models of dark energy, modified gravity theories can affect the propagation of GWs across cosmological distances, with modifications commonly parametrised in terms of two phenomenological parameters, $\Xi_0$ and $n$. In this work we adopt a Bayesian approach to constrain for the first time parametrised deviations from General Relativity using the loudest simulated EMRIs detected by LISA as dark sirens with a simulated galaxy catalog. Assuming all the cosmological parameters except $\Xi_0$ are already tightly constrained, our forecasts show that $\Xi_0$ can be constrained to a few percent level (90% C.I.) with 4 years of LISA observations, unless EMRI detection rates turn out to be closer to current pessimistic expectations. These results quickly degrade if additional cosmological parameters are inferred simultaneously, but become more robust with an extended LISA observation period of 10 years. Overall, we find that EMRIs with LISA are better at constraining modified GW propagation than current second-generation ground-based GW detectors, but they will only be comparable to third-generation detectors in the most optimistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field $\xi$ be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and $\xi$ contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for $F(R_{abcd})$ gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another $\xi$ independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in $F(R_{abcd})$ gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.</description>

Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as an inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility that quadratic gravity, as a renormalizable theory, describes the interior of quantum black holes. We find new exact power-law solutions to pure quadratic gravity under spherical symmetry, which are complex valued. The resulting solutions, dubbed powerballs, are horizonless compact objects that become Schwarzschild-like a small distance (of the order of the Planck length) outside the would-be Schwarzschild horizon. We present a description of the global eternal geometry, whose right and left exteriors are Lorentzian and Euclidean Schwarzschild-like regions, respectively, while the complex interior is a form of spiraling spacetime. We compute the total on-shell action integral as a saddle point to a gravitational path integral and discuss the Lorentzian and Euclidean interpretations thereof.</description>

Abstract: Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics and, despite their apparent simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We identify a class of continuous variable Markovian master equations for which positivity and complete positivity become equivalent. We apply this result to characterize the positivity of the partially transposed evolution of bipartite Gaussian systems, which encodes the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, the entangling properties of models of classical gravity interacting with quantum matter are investigated in the context of the experimental proposals to detect gravitationally induced entanglement. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Di\'osi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entanglement-based experiments have the potential to either falsify the model entirely or constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude above the current state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ has provided powerful insights into the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$, including some sub-leading logarithmic and non-perturbative corrections. Recently, the phase space of supersymmetric solutions has been argued to contain configurations other than the asymptotically AdS$_5$ black hole. Such configurations include the so-called grey galaxies where the black hole at the center is surrounded by a gas of gravitons. By numerically evaluating the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills at small values of $N$, we detect systematic deviations from the entropy of black holes with two distinct angular momenta. We find that the giant graviton expansion of the index is a numerically efficient way of evaluating the index that complements the direct character evaluation and allows for explicit access to $N\le 15$ with up to two giant gravitons in the expansion. We find it remarkable that a supersymmetric quantity in field theory, usually thought of as a rigid counting observable, indeed contains information about different phases in the space of supersymmetric solutions on the gravity side.</description>

Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian Fermions</title>

Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>
