      <title>VeruSAGE: A Study of Agent-Based Verification for Rust Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability to understand and develop code. However, their capability to rigorously reason about and prove code correctness remains in question. This paper offers a comprehensive study of LLMs' capability to develop correctness proofs for system software written in Rust. We curate a new system-verification benchmark suite, VeruSAGE-Bench, which consists of 849 proof tasks extracted from eight open-source Verus-verified Rust systems. Furthermore, we design different agent systems to match the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs (o4-mini, GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 4.5). Our study shows that different tools and agent settings are needed to stimulate the system-verification capability of different types of LLMs. The best LLM-agent combination in our study completes over 80% of system-verification tasks in VeruSAGE-Bench. It also completes over 90% of a set of system proof tasks not part of VeruSAGE-Bench because they had not yet been finished by human experts. This result shows the great potential for LLM-assisted development of verified system software.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of computing Strahler numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the problem of computing the Strahler number of a binary tree given as a term is complete for the circuit complexity class uniform $\mathsf{NC}^1$. For several variants, where the binary tree is given by a pointer structure or in a succinct form by a directed acyclic graph or a tree straight-line program, the complexity of computing the Strahler number is determined as well. The problem, whether a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form produces a derivation tree (resp., an acyclic derivation tree), whose Strahler number is at least a given number $k$ is shown to be P-complete (resp., PSPACE-complete).</description>

      <title>Characterization and Decidability of FC-Definable Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FC is a first-order logic that reasons over all factors of a finite word using concatenation, and can define non-regular languages like that of all squares (ww). In this paper, we establish that there are regular languages that are not FC-definable. Moreover, we give a decidable characterization of the FC-definable regular languages in terms of algebra, automata, and regular expressions. The latter of which is natural and concise: Star-free generalized regular expressions extended with the Kleene star of terminal words.</description>
