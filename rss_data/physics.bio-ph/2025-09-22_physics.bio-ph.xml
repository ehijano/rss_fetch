      <title>Conformational Dynamics of 8-Oxoguanine Mispairing Reveal a Mechanism of Polymerase {\lambda} Misincorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental evidence has shown the stability of oxygen-stress-damaged guanine, known as 8-oxoguanine. This common oxygen-damaged nucleobase is often found in the presence of reactive oxygen species and can result in the mispairing between adenine and 8-oxoguanine in a Hoogsteen pair. We have computationally investigated the role of 8-oxoguanine to support experimental results and focus the investigation towards the polymerase structure, identifying how 8-oxoguanine interacts in the polymerase environment. Quantum mechanical investigations show the Hoogsteen pairing of adenine and 8-oxoguanine is the most energetically favourable state compared to a Watson-Crick state, supporting experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamical calculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone spacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains within the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment, 8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm spacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted by tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that 8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\lambda}, can mimic the adenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would be misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.</description>

      <title>Scalable CVD Graphene Field-Effect Transistor Platform for Viral Detection: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscored the urgent need for fast, reliable, and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of responding to current and future viral threats. Early diagnosis is key to limiting transmission, and biosensors based on nanomaterials offer promising solutions for accurate and rapid bioanalyte detection. In this work, we present a scalable matrix of graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the direct and rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. High-quality graphene is functionalized in a single step with ACE2-His, enabling detection of the spike protein with a limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A robust statistical analysis, based on measurements from approximately 70 devices per analyte concentration, demonstrates the reproducibility and reliability of the platform. This label-free, scalable, and reproducible COVID-19 antigen sensor can be readily adapted to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other viral pathogens, offering a flexible approach for future diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Cell clusters sense their global shape to drive collective migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective migration of epithelial groups of cells plays a central role in processes such as embryo development, wound healing, and cancer invasion. While finite cell clusters are known to collectively migrate in response to external gradients, the competing effect of possible endogenous cues is largely unknown.Here, we demonstrate that the polarization of peripheral cells that pull the cluster's edge outward is sufficient to induce and sustain the collective migration of confluent clusters. We use a general continuum model to show that the underlying shape-sensing mechanism is purely mechanical, relying on long-range hydrodynamic interactions and cell-cell alignment forces. As a proof-of-concept, we validate our findings with experiments on monolayer clusters from various cell lines, where we control initial shapes and sizes. The mechanism operates independently of external signals and will generally interfere with them. Specifically, we predict and observe experimentally that it can override collective durotaxis, reversing the direction of migration. Together, our results offer a physical framework for understanding how cell interactions govern the interplay between global shape and collective motion and afford engineering principles for optimal control and manipulation of cell cluster shape and motion.</description>

      <title>Multicritical Infection Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Activity propagation with Hebbian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow and spatiotemporal chaos in chemically active emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phase-separating fluid mixtures as they demix in the presence of chemical reactions that maintain them away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We show that in such chemically active emulsions the interplay of chemical reactions, phase separation, and hydrodynamics effects complex self-organisation and pattern formation that can give rise to spatiotemporal chaos. This chaotic dynamics, unlike in classical turbulence, is not due to fluid inertia $-$ we analyse the system in the Stokes flow regime $-$ and it is different from the $\textit{turbulence}$ of active nematics at low Reynolds number, for our fluid mixtures lack any orientational order. To explore the generic features of nonlinear dynamics in our system, we derive amplitude equations which we find to be identical to those obtained for Rayleigh-Benard convection with mean flow and stress-free conditions at the top and bottom plates. Chemically active emulsions possessing no internal order, we thus establish, can exhibit chaoticity that is driven by interfacial stresses in the fluid mixture.</description>

      <title>Bacteria collective motion is scale-free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming bacteria interact hydrodynamically over long ranges, organizing themselves into collective states that drive large-scale chaotic flows, often referred to as "bacterial turbulence". Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work, it remains unclear whether an intrinsic length scale underlies the observed patterns. To shed light on the mechanism driving active turbulence, we investigate the emergence of large-scale flows in E. coli suspensions confined within cylindrical chambers, systematically varying confinement height over more than two orders of magnitude. We first demonstrate that the critical density for the onset of collective motion scales inversely with this confinement height without saturation, even for the smallest densities observed. Near the onset, both the observed length and time scales increase sharply, with the length scale bounded only by the vertical confinement. Importantly, both scales exhibit clear power-law dependence on the confinement height, demonstrating the absence of an intrinsic length scale in bacterial collective motion. This holds up to scales nearly 10,000 times the size of a single bacterium, as evidenced by transient coherent vortices spanning the full chamber width near the onset. Our experimental results demonstrating that bacterial turbulence is scale-free provide important constraints for theories aiming to capture the dynamics of wet active matter.</description>

      <title>Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles</title>

Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.</description>

      <title>An energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions in complex 3D terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.12717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor transitions through the real world.</description>

      <title>Coordinated appendages accumulate more energy to self-right on the ground</title>

Abstract: Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.</description>

      <title>Single-Trajectory Bayesian Modeling Reveals Multi-State Diffusion of the MSH Sliding Clamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.</description>
