      <title>Auctions with Dynamic Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of auctions with dynamic scoring, which allocate a single item according to a given scoring rule. We are motivated by online advertising auctions when users interact with a platform over the course of a session. The platform ranks ads based on a combination of bids and quality scores, and updates the quality scores throughout the session based on the user's online activity. The platform must decide when to show an ad during the session. By delaying the auction, the auctioneer acquires information about an ad's quality, improving her chances of selecting a high quality ad. However information is costly, because delay reduces market thickness and in turn revenue. When should the auctioneer allocate the impression to balance these forces?
  We develop a theoretical model to study the effect of market design on the trade-off between market thickness and information. In particular, we focus on first- and second-price auctions. The auctioneer can commit to the auction format, but not to its timing: her decision can thus be cast as a real options problem. We show that under optimal stopping the first-price auction allocates efficiently but with delay. Instead, the second-price auction generates more revenue by avoiding delay. The auctioneer benefits from introducing reserve prices, more so in a first-price auction.</description>

      <title>Speed, Accuracy, and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper re-examines the validity of using response time to infer problem complexity. It revisits a canonical Wald model of optimal stopping, taking signal-to-noise ratio as a measure of problem complexity. While choice quality is monotone in problem complexity, expected stopping time is inverse $U$-shaped. Indeed decisions are fast in both very simple and very complex problems: in simple problems it is quick to understand which alternative is best, while in complex problems it would be too costly -- an insight which extends to general costly information acquisition models. This non-monotonicity also underlies an ambiguous relationship between response time and ability, whereby higher ability entails slower decisions in very complex problems, but faster decisions in simple problems. Finally, this paper proposes a new method to correctly infer problem complexity based on the finding that choices react more to changes in incentives in more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Identification of Information Structures in Bayesian Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent can an external observer observing an equilibrium action distribution in an incomplete information game infer the underlying information structure? We investigate this issue in a general linear-quadratic-Gaussian framework. A simple class of canonical information structures is offered and proves rich enough to rationalize any possible equilibrium action distribution that can arise under an arbitrary information structure. We show that the class is parsimonious in the sense that the relevant parameters can be uniquely pinned down by an observed equilibrium outcome, up to some qualifications. Our result implies, for example, that the accuracy of each agent's signal about the state is identified, as measured by how much observing the signal reduces the state variance. Moreover, we show that a canonical information structure characterizes the lower bound on the amount by which each agent's signal can reduce the state variance, across all observationally equivalent information structures. The lower bound is tight, for example, when the actual information structure is uni-dimensional, or when there are no strategic interactions among agents, but in general, there is a gap since agents' strategic motives confound their private information about fundamental and strategic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quantal Response Equilibrium with a Continuum of Types: Characterization and Nonparametric Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantal response equilibrium (QRE), a statistical generalization of Nash equilibrium, is a standard benchmark in the analysis of experimental data. Despite its influence, nonparametric characterizations and tests of QRE are unavailable beyond the case of finite games. We address this gap by completely characterizing the set of QRE in a class of binary-action games with a continuum of types. Our characterization provides sharp predictions in settings such as global games, volunteer's dilemma, and the compromise game. Further, we leverage our results to develop nonparametric tests of QRE. As an empirical application, we revisit the experimental data from Carrillo and Palfrey (2009) on the compromise game.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does Artificial Intelligence (AI) affect the organization of work? We incorporate AI into an economy where humans endogenously sort into hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become "workers" (i.e., execute routine tasks), while more knowledgeable agents becomes "managers" (i.e., specialize in problem solving). We model AI as an algorithm that uses capital ("computing power") to mimic the behavior of humans with a given knowledge. AI leads to major reorganizations, affecting occupational choice, wages, and the size and productivity of firms. By explicitly incorporating the endogenous organization of knowledge, our results provide new insights into the effects of AI on the future of work.</description>
