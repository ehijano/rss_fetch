      <title>Mixed Traffic: A Perspective from Long Duration Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of autonomous vehicle has established mixed traffic environments, comprising both autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), as essential components of next-generation mobility systems. Along these lines, connectivity between autonomous vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) is also a significant factor that can effectively support higher-level decision-making. At the same time, the integration of V2I within mixed traffic environments remains a timely and challenging problem. In this paper, we present a long-duration autonomy controller for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating in such environments, with a focus on intersections where right turns on red are permitted. We begin by deriving the optimal control policy for CAVs under free-flow traffic. Next, we analyze crossing time constraints imposed by smart traffic lights and map these constraints to controller bounds using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with the aim to drive a CAV to cross the intersection on time. We also introduce criteria for identifying, in real-time, feasible crossing intervals for each CAV. To ensure safety for the CAVs, we present model-agnostic safety guarantees, and demonstrate their compatibility with both CAVs and HDVs. Ultimately, the final control actions are enforced through a combination of CBF constraints, constraining CAVs to traverse the intersection within the designated time intervals while respecting other vehicles. Finally, we guarantee that our control policy yields always a feasible solution and validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations in MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Approaches to Enhance Safety in Autonomous Vehicles: Minimizing Lane Changes and Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced safety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging maneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow. This paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a state-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes, thereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm prioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions necessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through simulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against established models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial reductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and improved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's adaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations, showcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems. Future work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the CARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more dynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with diverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and secure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV operations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing intelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance and overall traffic network efficiency.</description>

      <title>Make Your AUV Adaptive: An Environment-Aware Reinforcement Learning Framework For Underwater Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel environment-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to augment the operational capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater environments. Departing from traditional RL architectures, the proposed framework integrates an environment-aware network module that dynamically captures flow field data, effectively embedding this critical environmental information into the state space. This integration facilitates real-time environmental adaptation, significantly enhancing the AUV's situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Furthermore, the framework incorporates AUV structure characteristics into the optimization process, employing a large language model (LLM)-based iterative refinement mechanism that leverages both environmental conditions and training outcomes to optimize task performance. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's superior performance, robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>Local Differential Privacy for Distributed Stochastic Aggregative Optimization with Guaranteed Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization and multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends both on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents' optimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective functions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two main sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the additional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to the issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which could breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that can solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square convergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to noise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential privacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the convergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also rigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence rates. Experimental results on personalized machine learning using benchmark datasets confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Force Feedback Exoskeleton for Teleoperation Using Magnetorheological Clutches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an upper-limb exoskeleton teleoperation system based on magnetorheological (MR) clutches, aiming to improve operational accuracy and enhance the immersive experience during lunar sampling tasks. Conventional exoskeleton teleoperation systems commonly employ active force feedback solutions, such as servo motors, which typically suffer from high system complexity and increased energy consumption. Furthermore, force feedback devices utilizing motors and gear reducers generally compromise backdrivability and pose safety risks to operators due to active force output. To address these limitations, we propose a semi-active force feedback strategy based on MR clutches. Dynamic magnetic field control enables precise adjustment of joint stiffness and damping, thereby providing smooth and high-resolution force feedback. The designed MR clutch exhibits outstanding performance across key metrics, achieving a torque-to-mass ratio (TMR) of 93.6 Nm/kg, a torque-to-volume ratio (TVR) of 4.05 x 10^5 Nm/m^3, and a torque-to-power ratio (TPR) of 4.15 Nm/W. Notably, the TMR represents an improvement of approximately 246% over a representative design in prior work. Experimental results validate the system's capability to deliver high-fidelity force feedback. Overall, the proposed system presents a promising solution for deep-space teleoperation with strong potential for real-world deployment in future missions.</description>

      <title>Islanding Strategy for Smart Grids Oriented to Resilience Enhancement and Its Power Supply Range Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of distributed generators, islanded operation based on distributed generation is considered a vital means to enhance the reliability and resilience of smart grids. This paper investigates the main factors in islanding partition of smart grids and establishes a mathematical model for islanding division. A method to determine the maximum power supply range of distributed energy resources (DERs) based on the reachability matrix and power circle algorithm is proposed to improve computational efficiency. A dynamic programming method based on breadth-first search (BFS) is used to solve the islanding partition scheme, and a region correction method is applied to modify the maximum power supply area by considering controllable loads and prioritizing critical load restoration, thereby enhancing system resilience. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving smart grid resilience.</description>

      <title>Microgrid Operation Control with Adaptable Droop Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern low-carbon power systems come with many challenges, such as increased inverter penetration and increased uncertainty from renewable sources and loads. In this context, the microgrid concept is a promising approach, which is based on a segmentation of the grid into independent smaller cells that can run either in grid-connected or standalone mode.In microgrids, droop control is widely used for primary control. It enables proportional power sharing, depending on the droop gains. Operation control schemes considering droop control often assume fixed droop gains. However, using adaptive droop gains for grid-forming units allow to shape power sharing in presence of fluctuations, enhancing flexibility while maintaining a safe microgrid operation, particularly under uncertainty. This work introduces a bilinear formulation for microgrid operation control that finds optimal power setpoints and droop gains on a timescale of minutes by solving a finite horizon optimization problem. In detail, a robust minmax model predictive control scheme is designed for a standalone microgrid, comprising a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an energy storage. Closed-loop simulations are performed with and without variable droop gains. The results show an increase in renewable utilization of up to 7.5 % while reducing the power output of the fuel cell by 6 %, when allowing variable droop gains.</description>

      <title>Disruption of parkinsonian brain oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an advanced surgical treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), involving electrical stimulation of neurons within the basal ganglia region of the brain. DBS is traditionally delivered in an open-loop manner using fixed stimulation parameters, which may lead to suboptimal results. In an effort to overcome these limitations, closed loop DBS, using pathological subthalamic beta (13--30 Hz) activity as a feedback signal, offers the potential to adapt DBS automatically in response to changes in patient symptoms and side effects. However, clinically implemented closed-loop techniques have been limited to date to simple control algorithms, due to the inherent uncertainties in the dynamics involved. Model-free control, which has already seen successful applications in the field of bioengineering, offers a way to avoid this limitation and provides an alternative method to apply modern control approach to selective suppression of pathological oscillations.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional evaluation on a rural integrated energy system including solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the novel municipal-scale rural integrated energy system (RIES), which encompasses energy supply and application. By constructing a seven-dimensional evaluation system including energy efficiency, energy supply, low-carbon sustainability, environmental impact, energy economy, social benefits, and integrated energy system development, this research combines the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) by sum of squares of deviations to balance expert experience and data objectivity. Furthermore, the cloud model is introduced to handle the fuzziness and randomness in the evaluation. This method can quantify the differences in system performance before and after the planning implementation. The results indicate that after planning, the comprehensive score has increased from 83.12 to 87.55, the entropy value has decreased from 6.931 to 5.336, indicating enhanced system stability. The hyper-entropy has dropped from 3.08 to 2.278, reflecting a reduction in uncertainty. The research findings provide a scientific basis for the planning optimization, policy-making, and sustainable development of rural integrated energy systems, possessing both theoretical innovation and practical guiding value.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Path-Following Control for a Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems. To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following approach is presented.</description>

      <title>DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO: a Model-free Solution for Numerical Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the problem of data-driven numerical optimal control for unknown nonlinear systems. In our scenario, we suppose to have the possibility of performing multiple experiments (or simulations) on the system. Experiments are performed by relying on a data-driven tracking controller able to steer the system towards a desired reference. Our proposed DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO algorithm iteratively refines a tentative solution of the optimal control problem by computing an approximate descent direction via a local trajectory perturbation. At each iteration, multiple trajectories are gathered by perturbing the current trajectory with a suitable dither signal, and then used to obtain a data-driven, time-varying linearization. The exploration is guided by the tracking controller, so that perturbed trajectories are obtained in closed loop. We show local convergence of DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO to a ball about an isolated optimal solution, whose radius depends on the amplitude of the dither signal. We corroborate the theoretical results by applying it to an underactuated robot.</description>

      <title>A Data-Integrated Framework for Learning Fractional-Order Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.</description>

      <title>Human Locomotion Implicit Modeling Based Real-Time Gait Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations. However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness, particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot interaction across diverse real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Innovative Strategies for the Coverage Problem: Path Planning, Search Optimization, and Applications in Underwater Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders, particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational feasibility.</description>

      <title>On Exact Solutions to the Linear Bellman Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for optimal control of systems with dynamics given by a linear operator, in order to obtain an explicit solution to the Bellman equation that can be calculated in a distributed fashion. Further, the class of Linearly Solvable MDP is reformulated as a continuous-state optimal control problem. It is shown that this class naturally satisfies the conditions for explicit solution of the Bellman equation, motivating the extension of previous results to semilinear dynamics to account for input nonlinearities. The applicability of the given conditions is illustrated in scenarios with linear and quadratic cost, corresponding to the Stochastic Shortest Path and Linear-Quadratic Regulator problems.</description>

Abstract: We present data-based conditions for enforcing contractivity via feedback control and obtain desired asymptotic properties of the closed-loop system. We focus on unknown nonlinear control systems whose vector fields are expressible via a dictionary of functions and derive data-dependent semidefinite programs whose solution returns the controller that guarantees contractivity. When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combinations of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally, we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>Joint Observer Gain and Input Design for Asymptotic Active Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint gain and input design method for observer-based asymptotic active fault diagnosis, which is based on a newly-defined notion named the excluding degree of the origin from a zonotope. Using the excluding degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a single gain design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed, respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.</description>

      <title>Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach to Energy and Water Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema with Application to Risk-Sensitive Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-Barycenter Consensus for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents' joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and final coordination success.</description>

      <title>EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling objects with unknown or changing masses is a common challenge in robotics, often leading to errors or instability if the control system cannot adapt in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator to reliably follow waypoints while automatically estimating and compensating for unknown payload weight. Our method integrates an admittance control framework with a mass estimator, allowing the robot to dynamically update an excitation force to compensate for the payload mass. This strategy mitigates end-effector sagging and preserves stability when handling objects of unknown weights. We experimentally validated our approach in a challenging pick-and-place task on a shelf with a crossbar, improved accuracy in reaching waypoints and compliant motion compared to a baseline admittance-control scheme. By safely accommodating unknown payloads, our work enhances flexibility in robotic automation and represents a significant step forward in adaptive control for uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>From Data-Driven to Purpose-Driven Artificial Intelligence: Systems Thinking for Data-Analytic Automation of Patient Care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.</description>
