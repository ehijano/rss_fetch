      <title>False discovery rate control with compound p-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of multiple testing, compound p-values generalize p-values by asking for superuniformity to hold only \emph{on average} across all true nulls. We study the properties of the Benjamini--Hochberg procedure applied to compound p-values. Under independence, we show that the false discovery rate (FDR) is at most $1.93\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the nominal level, and exhibit a distribution for which the FDR is $\frac{7}{6}\alpha$. If additionally all nulls are true, then the upper bound can be improved to $\alpha + 2\alpha^2$, with a corresponding worst-case lower bound of $\alpha + \alpha^2/4$. Under positive dependence, on the other hand, we demonstrate that FDR can be inflated by a factor of $O(\log m)$, where~$m$ is the number of hypotheses. We provide numerous examples of settings where compound p-values arise in practice, either because we lack sufficient information to compute non-trivial p-values, or to facilitate a more powerful analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact Distribution of the Noncentral Complex Roy's Largest Root Statistic via Pieri's Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the exact distribution and moment of the noncentral complex Roy's largest root statistic, expressed as a product of complex zonal polynomials. We show that the linearization coefficients arising from the product of complex zonal polynomials in the distribution of Roy's test under a specific alternative hypothesis can be explicitly computed using Pieri's formula, a well-known result in combinatorics. These results were then applied to compute the power of tests in the complex multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).</description>

      <title>Factorization by extremal privacy mechanisms: new insights into efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiency under $\alpha$ local differential privacy ($\alpha$ LDP) in both discrete and continuous settings. Building on a factorization lemma, which shows that any privacy mechanism can be decomposed into an extremal mechanism followed by additional randomization, we reduce the Fisher information maximization problem to a search over extremal mechanisms. The representation of extremal mechanisms requires working in infinite dimensional spaces and invokes advanced tools from convex and functional analysis, such as Choquet's theorem. Our analysis establishes matching upper and lower bounds on the Fisher information in the high privacy regime ($\alpha \to 0$), and proves that the maximization problem always admits a solution for any $\alpha$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of estimating the parameter of a uniform distribution on $[0, \theta]$ under $\alpha$ LDP. Guided by our theoretical findings, we design an extremal mechanism that yields a consistent and asymptotically efficient estimator in high privacy regime. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bregman projections and convergence of the EM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate convergence of alternating Bregman projections between non-convex sets and prove convergence to a point in the intersection, or to points realizing a gap between the two sets. The speed of convergence is generally sub-linear, but may be linear under transversality. We apply our analysis to prove convergence of versions of the expectation maximization algorithm for non-convex parameter sets.</description>

      <title>New (and old) predictive schemes with a.c.i.d. sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in procedures for Bayesian inference that bypass the need to specify a model and prior but simply rely on a predictive rule that describes how we learn on future observations given the available ones. At the heart of the idea is a bootstrap-type scheme that allows us to move from the realm of prediction to that of inference. Which conditions the predictive rule needs to satisfy to produce valid inference is a key question. In this work, we substantially relax previous assumptions building on a generalization of martingales, opening up the possibility of employing a much wider range of predictive rules that were previously ruled out. These include ``old" ideas in Statistics and Learning Theory, such as kernel estimators, and more novel ones, such as the parametric Bayesian bootstrap or copula-based algorithms. Our aim is not to advocate in favor of one predictive rule versus the other ones, but rather to showcase the benefits of working with this larger class of predictive rules.</description>

      <title>Divergence and Model Adequacy, A Semiparametric Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adequacy for estimation between an inferential method and a model can be de{\ldots}ned through two main requirements: {\ldots}rstly the inferential tool should de{\ldots}ne a well posed problem when applied to the model; secondly the resulting statistical procedure should produce consistent estimators. Conditions which entail these analytical and statistical issues are considered in the context when divergence based inference is applied for smooth semiparametric models under moment restrictions. A discussion is also held on the choice of the divergence, extending the classical parametric inference to the estimation of both parameters of interest and of nuisance. Arguments in favor of the omnibus choice of the L 2 and Kullback Leibler choices as presented in [16] are discussed and motivation for the class of power divergences de{\ldots}ned in [5] is presented in the context of the present semi parametric smooth models. A short simulation study illustrates the method.</description>

      <title>Robust Tail Index Estimation under Random Censoring via Minimum Density Power Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a robust estimator for the tail index of a Pareto-type distribution under random right censoring, developed within the framework of the minimum density power divergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to integrate density power divergence into the context of randomly censored extreme value models, thus opening a new path for robust inference in this setting. Under general regularity conditions, the proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Its finite-sample behavior is thoroughly assessed through an extensive simulation study, which highlights its improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Finally, the practical relevance of the method is illustrated through an application to a real AIDS survival dataset.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-asymptotic bounds for the distance to the first-order Edgeworth expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain explicit bounds on the uniform distance between the cumulative distribution function of a standardized sum $S_n$ of $n$ independent centered random variables with moments of order four and its first-order Edgeworth expansion. Those bounds are valid for any sample size with $n^{-1/2}$ rate under moment conditions only and $n^{-1}$ rate under additional regularity constraints on the tail behavior of the characteristic function of $S_n$. In both cases, the bounds are further sharpened if the variables involved in $S_n$ are unskewed. We also derive new Berry-Esseen-type bounds from our results and discuss their links with existing ones. We finally apply our results to illustrate the lack of finite-sample validity of one-sided tests based on the normal approximation of the mean.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust against partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, when the model is misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, such as careless respondents. To this end, the estimator minimizes a robust loss function based on the divergence between observed frequencies and theoretical frequencies implied by the polychoric model. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation, is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed, and comes at no additional computational cost. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Covariate-Adjusted Bivariate Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ascertaining causal direction from observational data is a fundamental challenge in scientific inquiry. Of particular interest is the problem of covariate-adjusted bivariate causal discovery, i.e., determining the causal direction between X and Y in the presence of Z. While unadjusted bivariate causal discovery has seen significant advances (Hoyer et al., 2008; Ni, 2022), there is a lack of methodology dealing with real-world bivariate relationships, which are often modulated by a set of covariate(s), Z. Building on previous work in Purkayastha and Song (2025), we introduce a novel, nonparametric framework for the covariate-adjusted bivariate causal discovery problem and propose a conditional asymmetry coefficient to track said direction of causation. We develop a robust estimation procedure using kernel-based conditional density estimation with cross-fitting and also provide rigorous uncertainty quantification using a nonparametric kernel smoothing technique, addressing a key limitation of many existing algorithms. As a key application, we demonstrate how this framework can be applied to the problem of collider detection, a persistent challenge in causal structure learning. Simulation studies show our method's superior performance in identifying causal structures. We apply our approach to an epigenetic study (Perng et al., 2019), investigating the role of blood pressure in regulating the effects of DNA methylation. In summary, our work offers methodological advancement by providing a robust, inferential toolkit for dissecting complex, moderated bivariate causal relationships in observational data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Stationary Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23563v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``immersion-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Loss Functions for Measuring the Accuracy of Nonnegative Cross-Sectional Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the accuracy of cross-sectional predictions is a subjective problem. Generally, this problem is avoided. In contrast, this paper confronts subjectivity up front by eliciting an impartial decision-maker's preferences. These preferences are embedded into an axiomatically-derived loss function, one of the simplest version of which is described. The parameters of the loss function can be estimated by linear regression. Specification tests for this function are described. This framework is extended to weighted averages of estimates to find the optimal weightings. A special case occurs when the predictions represent resource allocations: the apportionment literature is used to construct the Webster-Saint Lag\"ue Rule, a particular parametrization of the loss function. These loss functions are compared to those existing in the literature. Finally, a family of bias measures are created using signed versions of these loss functions.</description>
