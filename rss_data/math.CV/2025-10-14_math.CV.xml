      <title>Division algebras of slice-Nash functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of Nash functions in the context of slice regular functions of one quaternionic or octonionic variable. We begin with a detailed analysis of the possible definitions of Nash slice regular functions which leads us to the definition of \textit{slice-Nash} function proposed in this paper (and which we strongly believe to be the natural generalisation of the classical real and complex Nash functions to this context). Once the `correct' definition of slice-Nash functions has been established, we study their properties with particular focus on their finiteness properties. These finiteness properties position this new class of slice-Nash functions as an intermediate class between the class of slice regular functions and the class of slice polynomials, in analogy with the classical real and complex case. We also introduce semiregular slice-Nash functions, in analogy with meromorphic Nash functions, and study their finiteness properties.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $\sum_n n! c_n z^n$ is entire and $c_n$ does not terminate, then $\sum_n c_n z^n$ has infinitely many zeros. We then use this result to give alternative proofs that the Le Roy functions $f_r(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{(n!)^r}$ for $r&gt;1$ and Bessel functions $J_\alpha(z)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m!\Gamma(m+\alpha+1)}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{2m+\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ have infinitely many zeros.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the dimension of the $p$-Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of the dimension of Bergman spaces has long been a central topic in several complex variables, uncovering profound connections with potential theory and function theory since the pioneering work of Carleson, Weigerinck, and others in the 1960s. We investigate the dimension of $p$-Bergman spaces associated with pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. By constructing $L^p$-versions of the extension theorems of Ohsawa and Ohsawa-Takegoshi, we establish several geometric and potential-theoretic criteria that ensure the spaces are infinite-dimensional. Sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of $p$-Bergman spaces of complete N-circle fibered Hartogs domains, balanced domains, and weighted $p$-Fock spaces are obtained by applying the mentioned $L^p$-analogs of extension theorems and generalizing a sufficient condition of Jucha.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we investigate the uniqueness problem of entire function concerning its derivative and shift and obtain two results. On of our result solves the open problem posed by Majumder et al. (On a conjecture of Li and Yang, Hiroshima Math. J., 53 (2023), 199-223) and the other result improves and generalizes the recent result due to Huang and Fang (Unicity of entire functions concerning their shifts and derivatives, Comput. Methods Funct. Theory, 21 (2021), 523-532) in a large extend.</description>

Abstract: For Banach spaces of analytic functions on the disc for which the polynomials are dense and their pointt evaluations continuous, we prove the following: If they contain a function such that the limit superior of its modulus is infinite almost everywhere on the unit circle, then the same is true for a residual set of functions.</description>

      <title>Subnormal transcendental meromorphic solutions of difference equations with Schwarzian derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of subnormal solutions of following three difference equations with Schwarzian derivative $$\omega(z+1)-\omega(z-1)+a(z)(S(\omega,z))^n=R(z,\omega(z)),$$ $$\omega(z+1)\omega(z-1)+a(z)S(\omega,z)=R(z,\omega(z)),$$ and $$(\omega(z)\omega(z+1)-1)(\omega(z)\omega(z-1)-1)+a(z)S(\omega,z)=R(z,\omega(z))$$ are studied by using Nevanlinna theory, where $n\ge 1$ is an integer, $a(z)$ is small with respect to $\omega$, $S(\omega,z)$ is Schwarzian derivative, $R(z,\omega)$ is rational in $\omega$ with small meromorphic coefficients with respect to $\omega$. The necessary conditions for the existence of subnormal transcendental meromorphic solutions of the above equations are obtained. Some examples are given to support these results.</description>

      <title>A proof of Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture for WRT invariants of Seifert fibered homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a general Seifert fibered integral homology $3$-sphere with $r\ge3$ exceptional fibers. For every root of unity $\zeta\not=1$, we show that the SU(2) WRT invariant of $X$ evaluated at $\zeta$ is (up to an elementary factor) the non-tangential limit at $\zeta$ of the GPPV invariant of $X$, thereby generalizing a result from [Andersen-Mistegard 2022]. Based on this result, we apply the quantum modularity results developed in [Han-Li-Sauzin-Sun 2023] to the GPPV invariant of $X$ to prove Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture [Witten 1989] for the WRT invariant of $X$. We also prove that the GPPV invariant of $X$ induces a higher depth strong quantum modular form. Moreover, when suitably normalized, the GPPV invariant provides an ``analytic incarnation'' of the Habiro invariant.</description>

      <title>Towards Fock Spaces in Hypercomplex Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bargmann-Fock space(or Fock space for short) is a fundamental example of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces that has found fascinating applications across multiple fields of current interest, including quantum mechanics, time-frequency analysis, mathematical analysis, and stochastic processes. In recent years, there has been increased interest in studying counterparts of the Fock space and related topics in hypercomplex analysis. This chapter presents a survey exploring various aspects of the Fock space from complex to hypercomplex analysis. In particular, we discuss different Fock spaces recently introduced in the setting of slice hyperholomorphic and slice polyanalytic functions of a quaternionic variable. The connection between slice hyperholomorphic (polyanalytic) Fock spaces and the classical theory of Fueter regular and poly-Fueter regular functions is established via the Fueter mapping theorem and its polyanalytic extension. This chapter focuses on Fock spaces consisting of functions of a quaternionic variable, with a brief discussion of related works in the Clifford setting.</description>

      <title>Dunkl derivative from moment differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work analyzes the theory of Dunkl operator as a moment differential operator. This last operator generalizes the first one whenever the sequence of moments satisfies appropriate classical properties, classically considered in the general theory of ultraholomorphic and ultradifferentiable classes of functions. In this sense, the theory of Dunkl operator is then generalized. On the other hand, some features developed in Dunkl theory, such as Dunkl translation, have not been considered in the theory of moment differential equations yet, which leads to a common mutualism involving both theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the invertibility of the Berezin transform of the symbol as a necessary and sufficient condition for the invertibility of the Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space $L^2_a(\mathbb{D})$. More precisely, if ${\phi} = c g + d \bar{g}$, where $c,d\in\mathbb{C}$ and $g\in H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$, the space of all bounded analytic functions, then $T_{\phi}$ is invertible on $L^2_a(\mathbb{D})$ if and only if $\inf\limits_{z\in \mathbb{D}}\left|\widetilde{\,{\phi}}(z)\right|=\inf\limits_{z\in \mathbb{D}}|\phi(z)|&gt;0$, where $\widetilde{\,{\phi}}$ is the Berezin transform of $\phi$.</description>

      <title>From amoebas to pluripotential theory on hybrid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>

      <title>Rough isometry between Gromov hyperbolic spaces and unbounded uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Zhou, Ponnusamy, and Rasila [Math. Nachr. (2025)] have established that the conformal deformations, with parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$, of a Gromov hyperbolic space via Busemann functions are uniform spaces for sufficiently small $\epsilon$. In this paper, we demonstrate that if two proper, roughly starlike Gromov hyperbolic spaces are roughly isometric, then the uniformity of their conformal deformations is a simultaneous property; that is, either both are uniform spaces or neither is. Our results provide a counterpart to the work of Shanmugalingam and Lindquist [Ann. Fenn. Math. (2021)].</description>

Abstract: We study toroidal compactifications of finite volume complex hyperbolic manifolds. We obtain results on the existence or nonexistence of K\"ahler metrics satisfying certain nonpositive curvature properties on these compactifications. Starting from quotients of complex hyperbolic space by deep enough non-uniform arithmetic lattices, we also verify the Shafarevich conjecture for their compactifications, by showing that their universal covers are Stein.</description>

      <title>Approximation of pseudohermitian structures via embeddings into spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,T^{1,0}X)$ be a compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold which is CR embeddable into the complex Euclidean space. We show that $T^{1,0}X$ can be approximated in $\mathscr{C}^\infty$-topology by a sequence of strictly pseudoconvex CR structures $\{\mathcal{V}^k\}_{k\in \mathbb N}$ such that each $(X,\mathcal{V}^k)$ is CR embeddable into the unit sphere of a complex Euclidean space. Furthermore, as a refinement of this statement, we show that given a one form $\alpha$ on $X$ such that $(X,T^{1,0}X,\alpha)$ is a pseudohermitian manifold we can approximate $(T^{1,0}X,\alpha)$ in $\mathscr{C}^\infty$-topology by a sequence of pseudohermitian structures $\{(\mathcal{V}^k,\alpha^k)\}_{k\in \mathbb N}$ on $X$ such that for each $k\in \mathbb N$ we have that $(X,\mathcal{V}^k,\alpha^k)$ is isomorphic to a real analytic pseudohermitian submanifold of a sphere. A similar result for the Sasakian case was obtained earlier by Loi-Placini. Let $(X,T^{1,0}X,\mathcal{T})$ be a compact Sasakian manifold, i.e. $\mathcal{T}$ is a transversal CR vector field and the one form $\alpha$ defined by $\alpha(\mathcal{T})=1$ and $\alpha(\operatorname{Re}T^{1,0}X)=0$ defines a pseudohermitian structure on $(X,T^{1,0}X)$. Loi-Placini showed that $(T^{1,0}X,\mathcal{T})$ can be smoothly approximated by a sequence of quasi-regular Sasakian structures $\{(\mathcal{V}^k,\mathcal{T}^k)\}_{k\in \mathbb N}$ on $X$ such that each $(X,\mathcal{V}^k,\mathcal{T}^k)$ admits a smooth equivariant CR embedding into a Sasakian sphere. Applying our methods to the Sasakian case we show that it is possible to approximate with a sequence of Sasakian structures having the form $\{(\mathcal{V}^k,\mathcal{T})\}_{k\in \mathbb N}$, i.e. we can keep the vector field $\mathcal{T}$. Further applications concerning Sasakian deformations, the embedding of domains into balls and local approximation results are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate a rank 1 model of virtual period maps and their associated winding quotient, where the winding quotient is a new phenomenon appeared in a recent study of virtual period maps and it requires a reformulation of the classical inversion problem for the period maps. We answer to the new inversion problem by introducing the q-multiplicatively periodic function, whose pull-back to the winding covering space is the Weierstrass p-function up to a correction by Eisenstein series E2, and which was used in recent mathematical physics.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies quasiconformal non-equivalence of Julia sets and limit sets. We proved that any Julia set is quasiconformally different from the Apollonian gasket. We also proved that any Julia set of a quadratic rational map is quasiconformally different from the gasket limit set of a geometrically finite Kleinian group.</description>

Abstract: Given a reproducing kernel $k$ on a nonempty set $X$, we define the reproductive boundary of $X$ with respect to $k$. Furthermore, we generalize the well known nontangential and horocyclic approach regions of the unit circle to this new kind of boundary. We also introduce the concept of a composition factor of $k$, an abstract analogue of analytic selfmaps of the unit disk. Using these notions, we obtain a far reaching generalization of the Julia-Carath\'eodory theorem, stated on an arbitrary set. We also prove Julia's lemma in the abstract setting and give sufficient conditions for the convergence of iterates of some selfmaps. As an application we improve the classical theorem on the unit disk for contractive multipliers of standard weighted Dirichlet spaces, as well as Besov spaces on the unit ball. Many examples and questions are provided for these novel objects of study.</description>

      <title>Schramm-Loewner evolution contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet when $\kappa$ is close to 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, which is the regime where the curve is self-intersecting but not space-filling. We show that there exists $\delta_0&gt;0$ such that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the range of an SLE$_\kappa$ curve almost surely contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet. Combined with a result of Ntalampekos (2021), this implies that in this parameter range, SLE$_\kappa$ is almost surely conformally non-removable, and the conformal welding problem for SLE$_\kappa$ does not have a unique solution. Our result also implies that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the adjacency graph of the complementary connected components of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is disconnected.</description>

      <title>Transverse slices, Ruas' conjecture, and Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a finitely determined, quasihomogeneous, corank 1 map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. We introduce the concept of the $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice of $f$}. Since such a slice is a plane curve, it admits a topological normal form, which we describe explicitly. Assuming the $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice hypothesis, we provide a proof for the equivalence between topological triviality and Whitney equisingularity in Ruas' conjecture within this setting. We also provide a counterexample which shows that Whitney equingularity does not imply bi-Lipschitz equisingularity, given an answer to a question by Ruas. Moreover, we show that every topologically trivial $1$-parameter unfolding of $f=(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ (not necessarily with $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice) is of non-negative degree; that is, any additional term $\alpha$ in the deformation of $f_i$ has weighted degree not smaller than that of $f_i$. As a consequence, we provide a proof of Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for 1-parameter families of such germs.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By using the Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>
