      <title>Sequential Maximal Updated Density Parameter Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Parameter Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for generating sequential parameter estimates and quantifying epistemic uncertainty in dynamical systems within a data-consistent (DC) framework. The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.</description>

      <title>Predicting Short Response Ratings with Non-Content Related Features: A Hierarchical Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether the human ratings of open ended responses can be explained with non-content related features, and if such effects vary across different mathematics-related items. When scoring is rigorously defined and rooted in a measurement framework, educators intend that the features of a response which are indicative of the respondent's level of ability are contributing to scores. However, we find that features such as response length, a grammar score of the response, and a metric relating to key phrase frequency are significant predictors for response ratings. Although our findings are not causally conclusive, they may propel us to be more critical of he way in which we assess open ended responses, especially in high stakes scenarios. Educators take great care to provide unbiased, consistent ratings, but it may be that extraneous features unrelated to those which were intended to be rated are being evaluated.</description>

      <title>Studying continuous, time-varying, and/or complex exposures using longitudinal modified treatment policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial discusses methodology for causal inference using longitudinal modified treatment policies. This method facilitates the mathematical formalization, identification, and estimation of many novel parameters, and mathematically generalizes many commonly used parameters, such as the average treatment effect. Longitudinal modified treatment policies apply to a wide variety of exposures, including binary, multivariate, and continuous, and can accommodate time-varying treatments and confounders, competing risks, loss-to-follow-up, as well as survival, binary, or continuous outcomes. Longitudinal modified treatment policies can be seen as an extension of static and dynamic interventions to involve the natural value of treatment, and, like dynamic interventions, can be used to define alternative estimands with a positivity assumption that is more likely to be satisfied than estimands corresponding to static interventions. This tutorial aims to illustrate several practical uses of the longitudinal modified treatment policy methodology, including describing different estimation strategies and their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We provide numerous examples of types of research questions which can be answered using longitudinal modified treatment policies. We go into more depth with one of these examples--specifically, estimating the effect of delaying intubation on critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality. We demonstrate the use of the open-source R package lmtp to estimate the effects, and we provide code on https://github.com/kathoffman/lmtp-tutorial.</description>
