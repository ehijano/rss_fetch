      <title>The Careless Coupon Collector's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Careless Coupon Collector's Problem (CCCP), a novel variation of the classical coupon collector, that we envision as a model for information systems such as web crawlers, dynamic caches, and fault-resilient networks. In CCCP, a collector attempts to gather $n$ distinct coupon types by obtaining one coupon type uniformly at random in each discrete round, however the collector is \textit{careless}: at the end of each round, each collected coupon type is independently lost with probability $p$. We analyze the number of rounds required to complete the collection as a function of $n$ and $p$. In particular, we show that it transitions from $\Theta(n \ln n)$ when $p = o\big(\frac{\ln n}{n^2}\big)$ up to $\Theta\big((\frac{np}{1-p})^n\big)$ when $p=\omega\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)$ in multiple distinct phases. Interestingly, when $p=\frac{c}{n}$, the process remains in a metastable phase, where the fraction of collected coupon types is concentrated around $\frac{1}{1+c}$ with probability $1-o(1)$, for a time window of length $e^{\Theta(n)}$. Finally, we give an algorithm that computes the expected completion time of CCCP in $O(n^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>Two approaches to low-parametric SimRank computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss low-parametric approaches for approximating SimRank matrices, which estimate the similarity between pairs of nodes in a graph. Although SimRank matrices and their computation require a significant amount of memory, common approaches mostly address the problem of algorithmic complexity. We propose two major formats for the economical embedding of target data. The first approach adopts a non-symmetric form that can be computed using a specialized alternating optimization algorithm. The second is based on a symmetric representation and Newton-type iterations. We propose numerical implementations for both methodologies that avoid working with dense matrices and maintain low memory consumption. Furthermore, we study both types of embeddings numerically using real data from publicly available datasets. The results show that our algorithms yield a good approximation of the SimRank matrices, both in terms of the error norm (particularly the Chebyshev norm) and in preserving the average number of the most similar elements for each given node.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Elementary Cellular Automata under Sequential Update Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a theoretical analysis of the sequential convergence of elementary cellular automata that have at least one fixed point. Our aim is to establish which elementary rules always reach fixed points under sequential update modes, regardless of the initial configuration. In this context, we classify these rules according to whether all initial configurations converge under all, some, one or none sequential update modes, depending on if they have fixed points under synchronous (or parallel) update modes.</description>

      <title>Repetition Threshold for Binary Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>
