      <title>GARA: A novel approach to Improve Genetic Algorithms' Accuracy and Efficiency by Utilizing Relationships among Genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic algorithms have played an important role in engineering optimization. Traditional GAs treat each gene separately. However, biophysical studies of gene regulatory networks revealed direct associations between different genes. It inspires us to propose an improvement to GA in this paper, Gene Regulatory Genetic Algorithm (GRGA), which, to our best knowledge, is the first time to utilize relationships among genes for improving GA's accuracy and efficiency. We design a directed multipartite graph encapsulating the solution space, called RGGR, where each node corresponds to a gene in the solution and the edge represents the relationship between adjacent nodes. The edge's weight reflects the relationship degree and is updated based on the idea that the edges' weights in a complete chain as candidate solution with acceptable or unacceptable performance should be strengthened or reduced, respectively. The obtained RGGR is then employed to determine appropriate loci of crossover and mutation operators, thereby directing the evolutionary process toward faster and better convergence. We analyze and validate our proposed GRGA approach in a single-objective multimodal optimization problem, and further test it on three types of applications, including feature selection, text summarization, and dimensionality reduction. Results illustrate that our GARA is effective and promising.</description>

      <title>Assembling Modular, Hierarchical Cognitive Map Learners with Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive map learners (CML) are a collection of separate yet collaboratively trained single-layer artificial neural networks (matrices), which navigate an abstract graph by learning internal representations of the node states, edge actions, and edge action availabilities. A consequence of this atypical segregation of information is that the CML performs near-optimal path planning between any two graph node states. However, the CML does not learn when or why to transition from one node to another. This work created CMLs with node states expressed as high dimensional vectors consistent with hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a form of symbolic machine learning (ML). This work evaluated HDC-based CMLs as ML modules, capable of receiving external inputs and computing output responses which are semantically meaningful for other HDC-based modules. Several CMLs were prepared independently then repurposed to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle without retraining these CMLs and without explicit reference to their respective graph topologies. This work suggests a template for building levels of biologically plausible cognitive abstraction and orchestration.</description>

      <title>Modular, Hierarchical Machine Learning for Sequential Goal Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a maze populated with different objects, one may task a robot with a sequential goal completion task, e.g. 1) pick up a key then 2) unlock the door then 3) unlock the treasure chest. A typical machine learning (ML) solution would involve a monolithically trained artificial neural network (ANN). However, if the sequence of goals or the goals themselves change, then the ANN must be significantly (or, at worst, completely) retrained. Instead of a monolithic ANN, a modular ML component would be 1) independently optimizable (task-agnostic) and 2) arbitrarily reconfigurable with other ML modules. This work describes a modular, hierarchical ML framework by integrating two emerging ML techniques: 1) cognitive map learners (CML) and 2) hyperdimensional computing (HDC). A CML is a collection of three single layer ANNs (matrices) collaboratively trained to learn the topology of an abstract graph. Here, two CMLs were constructed, one describing locations on in 2D physical space and the other the relative distribution of objects found in this space. Each CML node states was encoded as a high-dimensional vector to utilize HDC, an ML algebra, for symbolic reasoning over these high-dimensional symbol vectors. In this way, each sub-goal above was described by algebraic equations of CML node states. Multiple, independently trained CMLs were subsequently assembled together to navigate a maze to solve a sequential goal task. Critically, changes to these goals required only localized changes in the CML-HDC architecture, as opposed to a global ANN retraining scheme. This framework therefore enabled a more traditional engineering approach to ML, akin to digital logic design.</description>

      <title>DelGrad: Exact gradients in spiking networks for learning transmission delays and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Transmission delays play an important role in shaping these temporal characteristics. Recent work has demonstrated the substantial advantages of learning these delays along with synaptic weights, both in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. However, these approaches suffer from drawbacks in terms of precision and efficiency, as they operate in discrete time and with approximate gradients, while also requiring membrane potential recordings for calculating parameter updates. To alleviate these issues, we propose an analytical approach for calculating exact loss gradients with respect to both synaptic weights and delays in an event-based fashion. The inclusion of delays emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Our algorithm is purely based on the timing of individual spikes and does not require access to other variables such as membrane potentials. We explicitly compare the impact on accuracy and parameter efficiency of different types of delays - axonal, dendritic and synaptic. Furthermore, while previous work on learnable delays in SNNs has been mostly confined to software simulations, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of our approach on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform.</description>

      <title>Active Dendrites Enable Efficient Continual Learning in Time-To-First-Spike Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the human brain efficiently adapts to new tasks from a continuous stream of information, neural network models struggle to learn from sequential information without catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks. This limitation presents a significant hurdle in deploying edge devices in real-world scenarios where information is presented in an inherently sequential manner. Active dendrites of pyramidal neurons play an important role in the brain ability to learn new tasks incrementally. By exploiting key properties of time-to-first-spike encoding and leveraging its high sparsity, we present a novel spiking neural network model enhanced with active dendrites. Our model can efficiently mitigate catastrophic forgetting in temporally-encoded SNNs, which we demonstrate with an end-of-training accuracy across tasks of 88.3% on the test set using the Split MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we provide a novel digital hardware architecture that paves the way for real-world deployment in edge devices. Using a Xilinx Zynq-7020 SoC FPGA, we demonstrate a 100-% match with our quantized software model, achieving an average inference time of 37.3 ms and an 80.0% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Vision to Language: Image Reconstruction and Interaction via Non-invasive Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding non-invasive brain recordings is crucial for advancing our understanding of human cognition, yet faces challenges from individual differences and complex neural signal representations. Traditional methods require custom models and extensive trials, and lack interpretability in visual reconstruction tasks. Our framework integrating integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics by Vision Transformer 3D. The unified feature extractor aligns fMRI features with multiple levels of visual embeddings efficiently, removing the need for individual-specific models and allowing extraction from single-trial data. This extractor consolidates multi-level visual features into one network, simplifying integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we have enhanced the fMRI dataset with various fMRI-image related textual data to support multimodal large model development. The integration with LLMs enhances decoding capabilities, enabling tasks like brain captioning, question-answering, detailed descriptions, complex reasoning, and visual reconstruction. Our approach not only shows superior performance across these tasks but also precisely identifies and manipulates language-based concepts within brain signals, enhancing interpretability and providing deeper neural process insights. These advances significantly broaden non-invasive brain decoding applicability in neuroscience and human-computer interaction, setting the stage for advanced brain-computer interfaces and cognitive models.</description>

      <title>SQUAT: Stateful Quantization-Aware Training in Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight quantization is used to deploy high-performance deep learning models on resource-limited hardware, enabling the use of low-precision integers for storage and computation. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) share the goal of enhancing efficiency, but adopt an 'event-driven' approach to reduce the power consumption of neural network inference. While extensive research has focused on weight quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT), and their application to SNNs, the precision reduction of state variables during training has been largely overlooked, potentially diminishing inference performance. This paper introduces two QAT schemes for stateful neurons: (i) a uniform quantization strategy, an established method for weight quantization, and (ii) threshold-centered quantization, which allocates exponentially more quantization levels near the firing threshold. Our results show that increasing the density of quantization levels around the firing threshold improves accuracy across several benchmark datasets. We provide an ablation analysis of the effects of weight and state quantization, both individually and combined, and how they impact models. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation includes full precision, 8-bit, 4-bit, and 2-bit quantized SNNs, using QAT, stateful QAT (SQUAT), and post-training quantization methods. The findings indicate that the combination of QAT and SQUAT enhance performance the most, but given the choice of one or the other, QAT improves performance by the larger degree. These trends are consistent all datasets. Our methods have been made available in our Python library snnTorch: https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge-driven Memetic Algorithm for the Energy-efficient Distributed Homogeneous Flow Shop Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction of carbon emissions in the manufacturing industry holds significant importance in achieving the national "double carbon" target. Ensuring energy efficiency is a crucial factor to be incorporated into future generation manufacturing systems. In this study, energy consumption is considered in the distributed homogeneous flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSSP). A knowledge-driven memetic algorithm (KDMA) is proposed to address the energy-efficient DHFSSP (EEDHFSSP). KDMA incorporates a collaborative initialization strategy to generate high-quality initial populations. Furthermore, several algorithmic improvements including update strategy, local search strategy, and carbon reduction strategy are employed to improve the search performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of KDMA in solving EEDHFSSP is verified through extensive simulation experiments. It is evident that KDMA outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms across various evaluation aspects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Security: A Novel Feature Engineering Approach for ML-Based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our daily lives has led to a surge in data traffic, posing significant security challenges. IoT applications using cloud and edge computing are at higher risk of cyberattacks because of the expanded attack surface from distributed edge and cloud services, the vulnerability of IoT devices, and challenges in managing security across interconnected systems leading to oversights. This led to the rise of ML-based solutions for intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which have proven effective in enhancing network security and defending against diverse threats. However, ML-based IDS in IoT systems encounters challenges, particularly from noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features in varied IoT datasets, potentially impacting its performance. Therefore, reducing such features becomes crucial to enhance system performance and minimize computational costs. This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of ML-based IDS at the edge level by introducing a novel method to find a balanced trade-off between cost and accuracy through the creation of informative features in a two-tier edge-user IoT environment. A hybrid Binary Quantum-inspired Artificial Bee Colony and Genetic Programming algorithm is utilized for this purpose. Three IoT intrusion detection datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and BoT-IoT, are used for the evaluation of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Compositional Factorization of Visual Scenes with Convolutional Sparse Coding and Resonator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a system for visual scene analysis and recognition based on encoding the sparse, latent feature-representation of an image into a high-dimensional vector that is subsequently factorized to parse scene content. The sparse feature representation is learned from image statistics via convolutional sparse coding, while scene parsing is performed by a resonator network. The integration of sparse coding with the resonator network increases the capacity of distributed representations and reduces collisions in the combinatorial search space during factorization. We find that for this problem the resonator network is capable of fast and accurate vector factorization, and we develop a confidence-based metric that assists in tracking the convergence of the resonator network.</description>

      <title>EvGNN: An Event-driven Graph Neural Network Accelerator for Edge Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge vision systems combining sensing and embedded processing promise low-latency, decentralized, and energy-efficient solutions that forgo reliance on the cloud. As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme enabling the low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with Type-Aware Chromosomes for Traveling Salesman Problems with Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are emerging transportation problems known as the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSPD) and the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP) that involve using a drone in conjunction with a truck for package delivery. This study presents a hybrid genetic algorithm for solving TSPD and FSTSP by incorporating local search and dynamic programming. Similar algorithms exist in the literature. Our algorithm, however, considers more sophisticated chromosomes and less computationally complex dynamic programming to enable broader exploration by the genetic algorithm and efficient exploitation through dynamic programming and local search. The key contribution of this paper is the discovery of how decision-making processes for solving TSPD and FSTSP should be divided among the layers of genetic algorithm, dynamic programming, and local search. In particular, our genetic algorithm generates the truck and the drone sequences separately and encodes them in a type-aware chromosome, wherein each customer is assigned to either the truck or the drone. We apply local search to each chromosome, which is decoded by dynamic programming for fitness evaluation. Our new algorithm is shown to outperform existing algorithms on most benchmark instances in both quality and time. Our algorithms found the new best solutions for 538 TSPD instances out of 920 and 74 FSTSP instances out of 132.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Interpretable Neural Learning based on Local Information-Theoretic Goal Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of biological and artificial networks, an intuitive understanding of how their local learning dynamics contribute to network-level task solutions remains a challenge to this date. Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce 'infomorphic' neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.</description>

      <title>An extended asymmetric sigmoid with Perceptron (SIGTRON) for imbalanced linear classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a new polynomial parameterized sigmoid called SIGTRON, which is an extended asymmetric sigmoid with Perceptron, and its companion convex model called SIGTRON-imbalanced classification (SIC) model that employs a virtual SIGTRON-induced convex loss function. In contrast to the conventional $\pi$-weighted cost-sensitive learning model, the SIC model does not have an external $\pi$-weight on the loss function but has internal parameters in the virtual SIGTRON-induced loss function. As a consequence, when the given training dataset is close to the well-balanced condition considering the (scale-)class-imbalance ratio, we show that the proposed SIC model is more adaptive to variations of the dataset, such as the inconsistency of the (scale-)class-imbalance ratio between the training and test datasets. This adaptation is justified by a skewed hyperplane equation, created via linearization of the gradient satisfying $\epsilon$-optimal condition.
  Additionally, we present a quasi-Newton optimization(L-BFGS) framework for the virtual convex loss by developing an interval-based bisection line search. Empirically, we have observed that the proposed approach outperforms (or is comparable to) $\pi$-weighted convex focal loss and balanced classifier LIBLINEAR(logistic regression, SVM, and L2SVM) in terms of test classification accuracy with $51$ two-class and $67$ multi-class datasets. In binary classification problems, where the scale-class-imbalance ratio of the training dataset is not significant but the inconsistency exists, a group of SIC models with the best test accuracy for each dataset (TOP$1$) outperforms LIBSVM(C-SVC with RBF kernel), a well-known kernel-based classifier.</description>
