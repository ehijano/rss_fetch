      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Classification of Plane Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence, uniqueness and classification is established for plane waves supported by an irreversible reaction which is a smooth function of local reactant and product concentrations (or prey and predator populations). Rudimentary analytic techniques are used to guarantee a unique plane wave at every wavespeed $V&gt;V_*$ above some threshold. The result readily extends to cutoff reactions, which are zero below some threshold product concentration. These results are not novel, but the method of proof is.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of non-integrable hyperbolic-ellptic Ishimori system in the critical Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the hyperbolic-elliptic Ishimori system with general decoupling constant $\kappa \in \mathbb{R}$ and prove global well-posedness in the critical Sobolev space. The proof relies primarily on new bilinear estimates, which are established via a novel div-curl lemma first introduced by the second author in \cite{zhou_1+2dimensional_2022}. Our approach combines the caloric gauge technique with $U^p$-$V^p$ type Strichartz estimates to handle the hyperbolic structure of the equation. The results extend previous work on the integrable case $\kappa = 1$ to general $\kappa$ and provide a unified framework that also applies to hyperbolic and elliptic Schr\"odinger maps in dimensions $d \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and gradient estimates of a nonlinear elliptic equation for the V-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish gradient estimates for positive solutions to the nonlinear elliptic equation $$\Delta_{V}u^{m}+\mu(x)u+p(x)u^{\alpha}=0 , \quad m&gt;1$$on any smooth metric measure space whose $k$-Bakry-\'{E}mery curvature is bounded from below by $-(k-1)K$ with $K \geq 0$. Additionally, we obtain related Liouville theorems and Harnack inequalities. We partially extend conclusions of Wang, when $V=0$, $\mu=0$ the equation becomes $\Delta u^{m}+p(x)u^{\alpha}=0$. And $V=f$, $\mu=c, p=0 $, the equation becomes $\Delta_{f}u^{m}+cu=0 $.</description>

      <title>On the structure of entropy dissipation and regularity for quasi-entropy solutions to 1d scalar conservation laws and to isentropic Euler system with $\gamma=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate quasi-entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws in several space dimensions. In this setting, we introduce a suitable Lagrangian representation for such solutions. Next, we prove that, in one space dimension and for fluxes $f$ satisfying a general non-degeneracy condition, the entropy dissipation measures of quasi-entropy solutions are concentrated on a 1-rectifiable set. The same result is obtained for the isentropic Euler system with $\gamma = 3$, for which we also slightly improve the available fractional regularity by exploiting the sign of the kinetic measures.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for interacting particles on general adaptive dynamical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-population limit of interacting particle systems evolving on adaptive dynamical networks, motivated in particular by models of opinion dynamics. In such systems, agents interact through weighted graphs whose structure evolves over time in a coupled manner with the agents' states, leading to non-exchangeable dynamics. In the dense-graph regime, we show that the asymptotic behavior is described by a Vlasov-type equation posed on an extended phase space that includes both the agents' states and identities and the evolving interaction weights. We establish this limiting equation through two complementary approaches. The first follows the mean-field methodology in the spirit of Sznitman [28]. In this framework, we impose the additional assumption that the weight dynamics is independent of one of the agent's states, an assumption that remains well motivated from a modeling perspective and allows for a direct derivation of the mean-field limit. The second approach is based on the graph limit framework and is formulated in a deterministic setting. This perspective makes it possible to remove the aforementioned restriction on the weight dynamics and to handle more general interaction structures. Our analysis includes wellposedness and stability results for the limiting Vlasov-type equation, as well as quantitative estimates ensuring the propagation of independence. We further clarify the relationship between the continuum (graph limit) formulation and the mean-field limit, thereby providing a unified description of the asymptotic dynamics of interacting particle systems on adaptive dynamical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we establish space Bounded Variation $(BV)$ regularity of the solution for a non-linear parabolic partial differential equations involving a linear drift term. We study the problem in a bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, a general non-linearity and reasonable assumptions on the data. Our results also cover, as a particular case, the linear transport equation in a bounded domain with an outward-pointing drift vector field on the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the existence of forward self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of forward self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for any divergence-free initial velocity $u_0$ that is homogeneous of degree $-1$ and locally H\"older continuous. This result requires no smallness assumption on the initial data. In sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case, where $(-1)$-homogeneous vector fields are locally square-integrable, the 2D problem is critical in the sense that the initial kinetic energy is locally infinite at the origin, and the initial vorticity fails to be locally integrable. Consequently, the classical local energy estimates are not available. To overcome this, we decompose the solution into a linear part solving the heat equation and a finite-energy perturbation part. By exploiting a kind of inherent cancellation relation between the linear part and the perturbation part, we can control interaction terms and establish the $H^1$-estimates for the perturbation part. Further investigating the corresponding Leray system in weighted Sobolev space, we can derive an optimal pointwise estimate. This gives the faster decay of the perturbation part at infinity and enables us to construct global-in-time self-similar solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectrum of the Logarithmic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectrum $\Sigma_L$ associated with the logarithmic Laplacian. This spectrum is defined as the set of all pairs $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ for which the problem \[ L_\Delta u = \alpha u^+-\beta u^- ~\text{in} ~ \Omega \quad \text{and} \quad u=0 ~\text{in} ~\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Omega \] admits a nontrivial solution $u$. Here, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with $C^{1,1}$ boundary, $u^\pm = \max\{\pm u,0\}$, and $u = u^+ - u^-$. We show that the lines $\lambda_1^L \times \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \lambda_1^L$, where $\lambda_1^L$ denotes the first eigenvalue of $L_\Delta$, lies in the spectrum $\Sigma_L$ and are isolated within the spectrum. Furthermore, we establish the existence of the first nontrivial curve in $\Sigma_L$ and analyze its qualitative properties, including Lipschitz continuity, strict monotonicity, and asymptotic behavior. In addition, we obtain a variational characterization of the second eigenvalue of the logarithmic Laplacian and show that all eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues $\lambda &gt; \lambda_1^L$ are sign-changing. Finally, we address a nonresonance problem with respect to the Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectrum $\Sigma_L$, employing variational methods and carefully overcoming the difficulties arising from the contrasting features of the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1^L$.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness and concentration behavior of solutions for a nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a nonlinear system of two coupled fractional Schr\"odinger equations with both attractive intraspecies and attractive interspecies interactions in $\mathbb{R}$. By analyzing an associated $L^2$-constrained minimization problem, the uniqueness of solutions to this system is proved via the implicit function theorem. Under a certain type of trapping potential, by establishing some delicate energy estimates, we present a detailed analysis on the concentration behavior of the solutions as the total strength of intraspecies and interspecies interactions tends to a critical value, where each component of the solutions blows up and concentrates at a flattest common minimum point of the associated trapping potentials. An optimal blow-up rate of solutions to the system is also given.</description>

      <title>Global stability of vacuum for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system, where the speed of light $c$ is an arbitrary constant no less than 1, and we establish global existence and nonlinear stability of the vacuum for small initial data, with bounds that are uniform in $c$. The analysis is based on the vector field method combined with the Glassey-Strauss decomposition of the electromagnetic field, and does not require any compact support assumption on the initial data. A key ingredient of the proof is the derivation of a chain rule for the relativistic Boltzmann collision operator that is compatible with the commutation properties of the vector fields. These tools allow us to control the coupled kinetic and electromagnetic equations and to obtain global stability near vacuum.</description>

      <title>Fractional heat content asymptotics for Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for studying small-time asymptotics of the fractional heat content of $C^2$ non-characteristic domains in Carnot groups. Denoting the sub-Laplacian operator by $\mathcal{L}$, the fractional heat content of a bounded domain $\Omega$ is defined as $Q^{(\alpha)}_\Omega(t)=\int_{\Omega} u_\alpha(t,x)dx$, where $u_\alpha$ is the solution to the heat equation corresponding to the fractional sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_\alpha:=\mathcal{L}^{\alpha/2}$ with Dirichlet boundary condition on $\Omega$. We prove that for $1\le\alpha\le 2$, there exists explict rate function $\mu_\alpha: (0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that \[ \lim_{t\to 0}\frac{|\Omega|-Q^{(\alpha)}_\Omega(t)}{\mu_\alpha(t)}=|\partial\Omega|_H, \] where $|\partial\Omega|_H$ is the horizontal perimeter of $\Omega$. Moreover, the rate function $\mu_\alpha$ coincides with the same for the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Time Reparametrization and Chaotic Dynamics in Conformable $C_0$-Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives provide a fractional-looking calculus that remains local and admits a simple representation through classical derivatives with explicit weights. In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $\psi(t)=t^\alpha/\alpha$ and prove that every $C_0$--$\alpha$-semigroup $\{T_\alpha(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ can be written as $T_\alpha(t)=T(\psi(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\{T(s)\}_{s\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $\alpha$-hypercyclicity and $\alpha$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\alpha}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky on slowly-rotating Kerr-de Sitter in the vanishing $\Lambda$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove energy, Morawetz and $r^p$-weighted estimates for solutions to the Teukolsky equation set on a slowly-rotating Kerr-de Sitter background. The main feature of our estimates is their uniformity with respect to the cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$ (thus allowed to tend to $0$), while they hold on the whole domain of outer communications, extending up to $r\sim \Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. As an application of our result, we recover well-known corresponding estimates for solutions to Teukolsky on a slowly-rotating Kerr background in the limit $\Lambda\to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the trace regularity of the stress vector on the boundary of an elastic solid satisfying the time-dependent, displacement-traction problem for the Navier equations of linear elasticity in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, the solid's displacement is subject to Dirichlet- and Neumann-type conditions on different portions of its boundary and possibly non-zero body forces and initial data. Our regularity results are reminiscent of the so-called "hidden trace regularity" results for solutions to the scalar wave equation obtained in [12].</description>

      <title>On average population levels for models with directed diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2006 (J. Differential Equ.), Lou proved that, once the intrinsic growth rate $r$ in the logistic model is proportional to the spatially heterogeneous carrying capacity $K$ ($r=K^1$), the total population under the regular diffusion exceeds the total of the carrying capacity. He also conjectured that the dependency of the total population on the diffusion coefficient is unimodal, increasing to its maximum and then decreasing to the asymptote which is the total of the carrying capacity. DeAngelis et al (J. Math. Biol. 2016) argued that the prevalence of the population over the carrying capacity is only observed when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are positively correlated, at least for slow dispersal. Guo et al (J. Math. Biol. 2020) justified that, once $r$ is constant ($r=K^0$), the total population is less than the cumulative carrying capacity. Our paper fills up the gap for when $r=K^{\lambda}$ for any real $\lambda$, disproving an assumption that there is a critical $\lambda^{\ast} \in (0,1)$ at which the tendency of the prevalence of the carrying capacity over the total population size changes, demonstrating instead that the relationship is more complicated. In addition, we explore the dependency of the total population size on the diffusion coefficient when the third parameter of the dispersal strategy $P$ is involved: the diffusion term is $d \Delta(u/P)$, not just $d \Delta u$, for any $\lambda$. We outline some differences from the random diffusion case, in particular, concerning the profile of the total population as a function of the diffusion coefficient.</description>

Abstract: We verify a conjecture proposed by X. Chen and Y. Shi, which arises from their study of the Green function on spheres in Euclidean space. More precisely, let $M\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a closed $C^{2}$ embedded surface and suppose that there exists a point $p\in M$ so that its Green function $G$ is of the form $G(p,q)=-\frac{1}{2\pi} \ln d_{\mathbb{R}^3}(p,q)+c, \forall q\neq p$, then $M$ must be a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Opinion Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>

      <title>The viscous variational wave equation with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the variational wave equation with viscosity and transport noise as a system of three coupled nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. We prove pathwise global existence, uniqueness, and temporal continuity of solutions to this system in $L^2_x$. Martingale solutions are extracted from a two-level Galerkin approximation via the Skorokhod--Jakubowski theorem. We use the apparatus of Dudley maps to streamline this stochastic compactness method, bypassing the usual martingale identification argument. Pathwise uniqueness for the system is established through a renormalisation procedure that involves double commutator estimates and a delicate handling of noise and nonlinear terms. New model-specific commutator estimates are proven.</description>

      <title>Dissipation for codimension 1 singular structures in the incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. It is shown that energy conservation holds in any Onsager critical class in which smooth functions are dense. The argument is independent of the specific critical regularity and the underlying PDE. This groups several energy conservation results and it suggests that critical spaces where smooth functions are dense are not at all different from subcritical ones, although possessing the "minimal" regularity index. Then, we study properties of the dissipation $D$ in the case of bounded solutions that are allowed to jump on $H^d$-rectifiable space-time sets $\Sigma$, which are the natural dissipative regions in the compressible setting. As soon as both the velocity and the pressure posses traces on $\Sigma$, it is shown that $\Sigma$ is $D$-negligible. The argument makes the role of the incompressibility very apparent, and it prevents dissipation on codimension 1 sets even if they happen to be densely distributed. As a corollary, we deduce energy conservation for bounded solutions of "special bounded deformation", providing the first energy conservation criterion in a critical class where only an assumption on the "longitudinal" increment is made, while the energy flux does not vanish for kinematic reasons.</description>

      <title>Hot spots on cones and warped product manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extrema of solutions to the heat equation (i.e. hot spots) on a class of warped product manifolds of the form $([0,L]\times M,dr^2+f(r)^2h)$ where $(M,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. We prove that, under certain conditions on the warping function $f$, the statement of Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds for the corresponding warped product. We then go on to study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed Riemannian manifolds. In this case, under appropriate hypotheses on the initial condition, there are four possible long-time behaviors depending only on the spectral gap of the fiber $(M,h)$.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reactivity for Capturing Brownian Motion by Partially Reactive Patches on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the trapping of diffusing ligands, modeled as Brownian particles, by a sphere that has $N$ partially reactive boundary patches, each of small area and arbitrary shape, on an otherwise reflecting boundary. For such a structured target, the partial reactivity of each boundary patch is characterized by a Robin boundary condition, with a local boundary reactivity $\kappa_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$. For any spatial arrangement of well-separated patches on the surface of the sphere, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to derive explicit results for the capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ of the structured target, which is valid for any $\kappa_i&gt;0$. This target capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ is defined in terms of a Green's matrix, which depends on the spatial configuration of patches, the local reactive capacitance $C_i(\kappa_i)$ of each patch and another coefficient that depends on the local geometry near a patch. The analytical dependence of $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$ on $\kappa_i$ is uncovered via a spectral expansion over Steklov eigenfunctions. For circular patches, the latter are readily computed numerically and provide an accurate fully explicit sigmoidal approximation for $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$. In the homogenization limit of $N\gg 1$ identical uniformly-spaced patches with $\kappa_i=\kappa$, we derive an explicit scaling law for the effective capacitance and the effective reactivity of the structured target that is valid in the limit of small patch area fraction. From a comparison with numerical simulations, we show that this scaling law provides a highly accurate approximation over the full range $\kappa&gt;0$, even when there is only a moderately large number of reactive patches.</description>

      <title>The simultaneous effect of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis on the global existence and stability of a predator-prey system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines a fully parabolic predator-prey chemo-alarm-taxis system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Under specific parameter conditions, it is shown that the system admits a unique, globally bounded classical solution. The convergence of the solution is established through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. In addition, numerical simulations are presented to validate the asymptotic behaviour of the solution. The results highlight the significant role of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis coefficients in determining the existence and stability of predator-prey models, as discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity of weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for Alt-Caffarelli functionals with non-standard growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed constant $\lambda &gt; 0$ and a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$, we establish that almost-minimizers (functions satisfying a sort of variational inequality) of the Alt-Caffarelli type functional \[ \mathcal{J}_G({\bf v};\Omega) \coloneqq \int_\Omega \left(\sum_{i=1}^mG\big(|\nabla v_i(x)|\big) + \lambda \chi_{\{|{\bf v}|&gt;0\}}(x)\right) dx , \] where ${\bf v} = (v_1, \dots, v_m)$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, exhibit optimal (up-to-the boundary) Lipschitz continuity, where $G$ is a $\mathcal{N}$-function satisfying specific growth conditions. Our work extends the recent regularity results for weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for the $p$-Laplacian addressed in \cite{BFS24}, thereby providing new insights and approaches applicable to a wide class of non-linear one or two-phase free boundary problems with non-standard growth. Our findings remain novel and significant even in the scalar setting and for minimizers of the type considered by Mart\'{i}nez--Wolanski \cite{MW08} and da Silva \textit{et al.} \cite{daSSV2024}.</description>

      <title>Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove a uniform generalization bound that is independent of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments of our theoretical results with MNIST, and obtain agreement with the true test error within a 22 % margin on average.</description>

      <title>Lens rigidity in 2D: The reconstruction of a Riemann surface from its geodesic lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of whether a Riemannian manifold-with-boundary (M,g) in dimension two is uniquely determined from knowledge of the distances between points on its boundary. An affirmative answer is called boundary rigidity for (M,g); it is closely related to lens rigidity. The latter question originates in the problem of reconstructing the speed of sound in an unknown medium from measurements of the travel time of sound waves that are sent in and ultimately return to the boundary. We prove essentially optimal results on these rigidity questions:
  Our first result answers proves rigidity locally, near a convex portion of the boundary. Our second result proves rigidity globally, for manifolds with convex boundary, in the absence of trapping (closed geodesics), thus confirming a conjecture of Uhlmann. Our final result proves the optimal reconstruction for convex boundaries even in the presence of trapping, showing rigidity up to outermost trapped geodesics.
  Our results thus extend the classical work of Pestov and Uhlmann on rigidity of simple 2-manifolds, as well as the many prior results on injectivity of the X-ray transform, which address linearized versions of the rigidity problem. \par Our method is to treat the (non-linear) rigidity problem directly, where we simultaneously re-cast the lens data as generalized Riemannian circles, and obtain rigidity for these ``pseudo-circles'', by studying a system of equations that we show these objects must satisfy. The rigidity we obtain ultimately is proven via {novel} estimates that are reminiscent of energy-type estimates for hyperbolic equations.</description>
