      <title>Direct correlation between the near-proton-emission threshold resonance in $^{11}$B and the branching ratio of beta-delayed proton emission from $^{11}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Beta-delayed proton emission from neutron halo nuclei $^{11}$Be represents a rare decay process. The existence of the narrow resonance near the proton-emission threshold in $^{11}$B explains its unexpectedly high probability. However, the accurate value of the branching ratio remains challenging to determine. Purpose: We aim to provide a microscopic potential model to determine the branching ratio for beta-delayed proton emission from $^{11}$Be. We focus on quantifying the influence of the narrow resonance near the proton emission threshold on the result of the branching ratio. Method: We employ the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation within the potential model to obtain the branching ratio. We derive the single-particle potentials for the halo neutron and the emitting proton from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation with minimal adjustment. As the resonance position is tightly linked to the potential depth, we can demonstrate quantitatively how variations in its location impact the outcome. Result: Slight variations in the resonance position significantly impact the branching ratio, with the upper limit reaching the order of $10^{-5}$. Conclusion: Experimental determination of the resonance energy, particularly whether it lies below $200$ keV, is crucial for determining the value of the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Neutron-rich isotope production for $Z\geq 98$ in ${}^{238} \mathrm{U}+{ }^{248} \mathrm{Cm}$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions in actinide systems are a promising method to synthesize transuranium neutron-rich elements. Appropriate theoretical approaches are needed to understand the mechanism behind MNT. Purpose: This work aims to produce neutron-rich isotopes in the super-heavy region through the ${}^{238} \mathrm{U}+{ }^{248} \mathrm{Cm}$ system. We employ a microscopic approach to elucidate reaction mechanisms, and predict new isotope production that expands the known nuclear chart. Methods: The stochastic mean-field (SMF) approach, including fluctuations and correlations, is used to explain the primary cross-sections in MNT reactions based on the quasi-fission and inverse quasi-fission processes, and a statistical de-excitation model with GEMINI++ code to calculate the secondary fragment cross-sections Results: The calculated cross-sections using SMF and GEMINI++ explain available experimental results for the ${}^{238} \mathrm{U}+{ }^{248} \mathrm{Cm}$ system at $E_\mathrm{c.m.}=898.7$~MeV energy. This shows the effectiveness and applicability of the quantal diffusion approach based on the SMF theory in heavy-ion collisions. Conclusions: Production of transuranium neutron-rich elements with a proton number up to $Z=$101 are obtained with sizable cross-sections. Theoretical results calculated for the Z=102-105 region, for which there are no experimental data, show that the cross-section values would be lower than the microbarn level. SMF theory does not contain any adjustable parameters other than the standard parameters of the energy density functional used in the TDHF theory and is an important approach for the microscopic understanding of reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A proposal for verifying the alpha-cluster structure at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the various internal structures of an excited nucleus can lead to different topological configurations of nuclear fragments during fragmentation. However, these internal structures may transition from one configuration to another with varying probabilities. Utilizing a partitioning method based on equal (or unequal) probabilities -- without incorporating the alpha-cluster ($\alpha$-cluster) model -- allows for the derivation of diverse topological configurations of nuclear fragments resulting from fragmentation. Subsequently, we predict the multiplicity distribution of nuclear fragments for specific excited nuclei, such as $^9$Be$^*$, $^{12}$C$^*$, and $^{16}$O$^*$, which can be produced in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). According to the $\alpha$-cluster model, an $\alpha$-cluster structure should take precedence among different internal structures; this may result in deviations in the multiplicity distributions of nuclear fragments with charge $Z=2$, compared to those predicted by the partitioning methods. The findings presented herein could serve as a reference for validating the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrized nucleon density distributions are widely employed for the calculation of the properties of atomic nuclei and dense inhomogeneous matter in compact stars within the Thomas-Fermi method and its extensions. We show that the use of insufficiently smooth parametrizations may deteriorate the accuracy of this method. We discuss and clarify the smoothness condition using the example of the so-called "nuclear pasta" in the neutron star mantle.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole-hexadecapole correlations in neutron-rich samarium and gadolinium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of quadrupole-hexadecapole correlation effects in even-even Sm and Gd isotopes with neutron number $N=88-106$. The calculations are performed in the framework of the Gogny energy density functional (EDF) with the D1S parametrization and the $sdg$ interacting boson model (IBM). The quadrupole-hexadecapole constrained self-consistent mean-field potential energy surface is mapped onto the expectation value of the $sdg$-boson Hamiltonian. This procedure determines the parameters of the $sdg$-IBM Hamiltonian microscopically. Calculated excitation energies and transition strengths are compared to the ones obtained with a simpler $sd$-IBM, as well as with the experimental data. The Gogny-EDF mapped $sdg$-IBM reproduces spectroscopic properties of the studied nuclei as reasonably as in the case of the previous $sdg$-boson mapping calculations that were based on the relativistic EDF, indicating that the axial quadrupole-hexadecapole method is sound regardless of whether relativistic or nonrelativistic EDF is employed. The mapped $sdg$-IBM improves some of the results in lighter Sm and Gd isotopes compared to the mapped $sd$-IBM, implying the existence of significant hexadecapole correlations in those nuclei. For those nuclei with $N \geq 94$, hexadecapole effects are minor, and the only significant difference between the two boson models can be found in the description of $E0$ monopole transitions.</description>

      <title>1+1 dimensional relativistic viscous non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics with longitudinal boost invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 1+1 dimensional relativistic non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with longitudinal boost invariance and shear stress tensor. Several analytical solutions that describe the fluid temperature evolution under the equation of state (EoS) $\varepsilon=3p$ are derived, relevant to relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Extending the Victor-Bjorken ideal MHD flow to include non-zero shear viscosity, two perturbative analytical solutions for the first-order (Navier-Stokes) approximation are obtained. For small, power-law evolving external magnetic fields, our solutions are stable and show that both magnetic field and shear viscosity cause fluid heating with an early temperature peak, align with the numerical results. In the second-order (Israel-Stewart) theory, our findings show that the combined presence of magnetic field and shear viscosity leads to a slow cooling rate of fluid temperature, with initial shear stress significantly affecting temperature evolution of QGP.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Neural Networks through the lens of Group Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the method of Neural Quantum States applied to the many-body problem of atomic nuclei. Through the lens of group representation theory, we focus on the problem of constructing neural-network ans\"atze that respect physical symmetries. We explicitly prove that determinants, which are among the most common methods to build antisymmetric neural-network wave functions, can be understood as the result of a group convolution. We also identify the reason why this construction is so efficient in practice compared to other group convolutional operations. We conclude that group representation theory is a promising avenue to incorporate explicitly symmetries in Neural Quantum States.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda NN$ input to neutron stars from hypernuclear data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our two 2023 publications [PLB 837 137669, NPA 1039 122725] where fitting 14 1$s_\Lambda$ and 1$p_\Lambda$ single-particle binding energies in hypernuclei across the periodic table led to a well-defined $\Lambda$-nucleus optical potential. The potential consists of a Pauli modified linear-density ($\Lambda N$) and a quadratic-density ($\Lambda NN$) terms. The present work reports on extending the above analysis to 21 $\Lambda$ single-particle data points input by including 1$d_\Lambda$ and 1$f_\Lambda$ states in medium-weight and heavy hypernuclei. The upgraded results for the $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda NN$ potential depths at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$~fm$^{-3}$, $D^{(2)}_\Lambda=-37.5\mp 0.7$~MeV and $D^{(3)}_\Lambda=+9.8\pm 1.2$~MeV together with the total depth $D_\Lambda=-27.7\pm 0.5$~MeV, agree within errors with the earlier results. The $\Lambda$ hypernuclear overbinding associated with the $\Lambda N$-induced potential depth $D^{(2)}_\Lambda$ agrees quantitatively with a recent combined analysis of low-energy $\Lambda p$ scattering data and correlation functions [PLB 850 (2024) 138550]. These results, particularly the size of the repulsive $D^{(3)}_\Lambda$, provide an essential input towards resolving the 'hyperon puzzle' in the core of neutron stars. We also show that a key property of our $\Lambda NN$-induced potential term, i.e. a need to suppress the quadratic-density $\Lambda NN$ term involving an excess neutron and a $N=Z$ core nucleon, can be tested in the forthcoming JLab E12-15-008 experiment.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Ferroaxionic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that piezoelectric materials can be used to source virtual QCD axions, generating a new axion-mediated force. Spontaneous parity violation within the piezoelectric crystal combined with time-reversal violation from aligned spins provide the necessary symmetry breaking to produce an effective in-medium scalar coupling of the axion to nucleons up to 7 orders of magnitude larger than that in vacuum. We propose a detection scheme based on nuclear spin precession caused by the axion's pseudoscalar coupling to nuclear spins. This signal is resonantly enhanced when the distance between the source crystal and the spin sample is modulated at the spin precession frequency. Using this effect, future experimental setups can be sensitive to the QCD axion in the unexplored mass range from $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>Large quadrupole deformation in $^{20}$Ne challenges rotor model and modern theory: urging for $\alpha$ clusters in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectroscopic quadrupole moment of the first excited state, $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})$, at 1.634 MeV in $^{20}$Ne was determined from sensitive reorientation-effect Coulomb-excitation measurements using a heavy target and safe energies well below the Coulomb barrier. Particle-$\gamma$ coincidence measurements were collected at iThemba LABS with a digital data-acquisition system using the {\sc AFRODITE} array coupled to an annular, doubled-sided silicon detector. A precise value of $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})=-0.22(2)$ eb was determined at backward angles in agreement with the only safe-energy measurement prior to this work, $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})=-0.23(8)$ eb. This result adopts 1$\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculations of the nuclear dipole polarizability of the 2$^+_1$ state that contributes to the effective quadrupole interaction and determination of $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})$. It disagrees, however, with the ideal rotor model for axially-symmetric nuclei by almost $3\sigma$. Larger discrepancies are computed by modern state-of-the-art calculations performed in this and prior work, including {\it ab initio} shell model with chiral effective interactions and the multi-reference relativistic energy density functional ({\sc MR-EDF}) model. The intrinsic nucleon density of the 2$^+_1$ state in $^{20}$Ne calculated with the {\sc MR-EDF} model illustrates the presence of $\alpha$ clustering, which explains the largest discrepancy with the rotor model found in the nuclear chart and motivates the explicit inclusion of $\alpha$ clustering for full convergence of $E2$ collective properties.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent thermodynamical treatment for quark matter in quasi-particle model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the medium effects in strange quark matter in the framework of a grand-canonical ensemble using the phenomenological quasi-particle model. This model is studied with proper self-consistent thermodynamical treatment by incorporating chemical potential-dependent quark mass. We have also included the vector interaction in a self-consistent way. The main aim of this work is to explore the proper thermodynamic treatment in addressing the medium effects at both zero and finite temperatures. In the case of the finite temperature, we explore the study of self-consistent thermodynamics in the isothermal as well as the isentropic processes. The effect of finite temperature and lepton fraction have been studied on the equation of state, speed of sound, and particle fraction. The $M-R$ and $M-\Lambda$ diagrams are found to be consistent with the observational constraints.</description>

Abstract: The majority of atomic nuclei have deformed shapes and nearly all these shapes are symmetric with respect to reflection. There are only a few reflection asymmetric pear-shaped nuclei that have been found in actinide and lanthanide regions, which have static octupole deformation. These nuclei possess an intrinsic electric dipole moment due to the shift between the center of charge and the center of mass. This manifests in the enhancement of the electric dipole transition rates. In this article, we report on the measurement of the lifetimes of the high spin levels of the two alternate parity bands in $^{100}$Ru through the Doppler Shift Attenuation Method. The estimated electric dipole transition rates have been compared with the calculated transition rates using the triaxial projected shell model without octupole deformation, and are found to be an order of magnitude enhanced. Thus, the observation of seven inter-leaved electric dipole transitions with enhanced rates establish $^{100}$Ru as possibly the first octupole deformed nucleus reported in the A $\approx$ 100 mass region.</description>

      <title>Evidence of non-Solar elemental composition in the clocked bursts from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In February and March 2024, several Type I X-ray bursts from the accreting neutron star SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 were detected by multiple X-ray satellites, with the first reports coming from INTEGRAL and NinjaSat. These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior as a ``clocked" burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 X-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short plateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in the tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In this study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various compositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of hydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\rm CNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\rm CNO}$ and/or lower $X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA J144459.2$-$60420. Therefore, we propose that this new XRB is likely the first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover, based on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed by NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \approx 1.5$ seems preferred over high-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for the neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the potential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related to the properties of the hot CNO cycle.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Elliptic Flow Coefficient and Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions using CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning based method with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is developed for simultaneous determination of the Elliptic Flow coefficient ($v_{2}$) and the Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions at relativistic energies. The proposed CNN is trained on Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with minimum biased events simulated with the AMPT event generator. A total of twelve models were built on different input and output combinations and their performances were evaluated. The predictions of the CNN models were compared to the estimations of the simulated and experimental data. The deep learning model seems to preserve the centrality and $p_{T}$ dependence of $v_{2}$ at the LHC energy together with predicting successfully the impact parameter with low margins of error. This is the first time a CNN is built to predict both $v_{2}$ and the impact parameter simultaneously in heavy-ion system.</description>

      <title>New multinucleon knockout model in NuWro Monte Carlo generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation and results of a new model for the n-particle n-hole ($\it{np-nh}$) contribution in the NuWro event generator, grounded in the theoretical framework established by the Valencia group in 2020. For the $\it{2p2h}$ component, we introduce a novel nucleon sampling function with tunable parameters to approximate correlations in the momenta of outgoing nucleons. These parameters are calibrated by comparing our results to those of the Valencia model across a range of incoming neutrino energies. In addition, our model incorporates a distinct contribution from the $\it{3p3h}$ mechanism. We discuss the differences between the new NuWro implementation, the original Valencia model, and the previous NuWro version, focusing on the distribution of outgoing nucleon momenta. Finally, we assess the impact of the hadronic model on experimental analyses involving hadronic observables.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we study the collinear limit of the Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) in single-inclusive jet production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. We introduce a non-perturbative model that allows us to describe the EEC in the entire angular region of the current experiments. Our results for $pp$ collisions show excellent agreement with CMS and ALICE data over a wide range of jet transverse momenta. For $pA$ collisions, we include modifications from the nuclear medium, and our predictions align well with the trends observed in recent ALICE measurements.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photo-hadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Coupling between collective modes in the deformed $^{98}$Zr nucleus: Insights from consistent HFB+QRPA calculations with the Gogny interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zirconium isotopes exhibit structural properties that present multiple challenges to nuclear theory. Investigations of the coupling present within isoscalar modes and within isovector modes are scarce but important for advancing our understanding of the microscopic picture of nuclei. To explore some of these underlying coupling features, and to test the predictive power of a state-of-the-art nuclear structure approach, we provide a detailed analysis of the properties of $^{90,96,98}$Zr. This region includes a benchmarking case and offers insights into nuclear deformation phenomena. To investigate the coupling between collective modes in deformed nuclei, we focused our analysis on the ground and excited-state properties of these isotopes, employing a consistent approach with the axially-symmetric deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) and the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) framework, both using the Gogny D1M force. This approach effectively describes both low-lying and giant-resonance states. We devoted special attention to the deformed $^{98}$Zr nucleus, where we confirm the existence of coupling between monopole and quadrupole excitations through the $K^{\pi} = 0^{+}$ QRPA components and demonstrate an analogous dipole-octupole coupling through the $K^{\pi} = 0^{-}$ and $K^{\pi} = 1^{-}$ components. Intrinsic transition densities and associated radial projections illustrate the coupling. Our work complements and extends earlier studies carried out using density-functional-based methods and notably, we included the complete Coulomb interaction also in the pairing fields, i.e. we treat terms exactly that are approximated in typical calculations that use the Gogny D1 and D2 interaction families.</description>

Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

      <title>Nonspherical Pauli-forbidden states in deformed halo nuclei: Impact on the ${}^7\mathrm{Be}+p$ resonant states in the particle rotor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: An important aspect of reducing nuclear many-body problems to few-body models is the presence of Pauli forbidden (PF) states, which are excluded in fully antisymmetrized calculations. Insufficient treatments of PF states in deformed halo nuclei underscore the need for model refinement.
  Purpose: We propose a new method utilizing Nilsson states as PF states in the orthogonality condition model, and investigate the impact of PF states on the properties of resonant states.
  Method: We investigate the scattering states of ${}^8\mathrm{B}$ within the Particle Rotor Model (PRM) framework based on a deformed ${}^7\mathrm{Be}$ core and $p$ two-body model. We compare several methods for eliminating PF states and test them with the experimental data.
  Results: Our model successfully reproduces the experimental excitation function for elastic scattering cross section by properly eliminating PF states. The same calculation predicts the presence of a low-energy bump in the inelastic scattering excitation function, although its position is overestimated by about 1 MeV compared to experimental data.
  Conclusion: This study extends the applicability of the PRM, offering a comprehensive approach for exploring structures and reactions of loosely bound nuclei like ${}^8$B. Future integration with the continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method promises to further advance the research.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Study of Spin Transfer in Near-Barrier Nuclear Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quasi-fission, it is unclear what the interaction between the relative orbital angular momentum and the spin of the fragments is from a microscopic perspective. In macroscopic approaches, it is expected that the large value of the relative orbital angular momentum, of the order of 100~$\hbar$ is transferred through tangential dissipation to the fragments' intrinsic spin by sliding and rolling friction.
  The goal is to investigate the angular momentum transfer from the initial relative orbital angular momentum to the fragments' spin. How is the transferred spin shared between the fragments? What is the time scale associated with the different mechanisms? How does deformation play a role?
  A TDDFT simulation in the TDHF-Skyrme framework is used to describe several reactions at different impact parameters with increasing complexity. A method is proposed to study the evolution of the fragments' total spin as a function of time and angular velocity.
  The increasingly complex reaction allows for careful analysis of all the mechanisms responsible for the transfer of spin. In particular, it is shown that the transfer of nucleons, and neck formation can significantly affect the transfer of spin through tangential friction.
  Several mechanisms are in contradiction with previous macroscopic calculations. In particular, the spin of the fragments does not always increase during the collision which prevents it from being used to estimate the collision time of the reaction.</description>

      <title>A modular perspective to the jet suppression from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to cover the jet radius parameter ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets up to 1 TeV (to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales) and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER module (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT module (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). These calculations are then compared with the experimental results collected at the ATLAS and the CMS detectors in the jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for the ATLAS detector and greater than 300 GeV up to 1 TeV for the CMS detector. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, with the deviations staying within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic multi-stage evolution of the parton shower.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>

Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>
