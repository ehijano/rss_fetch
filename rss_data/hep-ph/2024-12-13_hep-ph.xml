      <title>Jet substructure of light and heavy flavor jets at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider have been used to constrain parton distribution functions, test perturbative QCD, measure the strong-coupling constant, and probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. We extend these studies to lower energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that would additionally allow us to test existing models of non-perturbative physics. In this study, we present a \pythia-based Monte Carlo study of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The selection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We consider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet angularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of collinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.</description>

      <title>Axion mass prediction from adaptive mesh refinement cosmological lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion arises as the pseudo-Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken abelian Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. If the scale of PQ symmetry breaking occurs below the inflationary reheat temperature and the domain wall number is unity, then there is a unique axion mass that gives the observed dark matter (DM) abundance. Computing this mass has been the subject of intensive numerical simulations for decades since the mass prediction informs laboratory experiments. Axion strings develop below the PQ symmetry-breaking temperature, and as the string network evolves it emits axions that go on to become the DM. A key ingredient in the axion mass prediction is the spectral index of axion radiation emitted by the axion strings. We compute this index in this work using the most precise and accurate large-scale simulations to date of the axion-string network leveraging adaptive mesh refinement to achieve the precision that would otherwise require a static lattice with 262,144$^3$ lattice sites. We find a scale-invariant axion radiation spectrum to within 1% precision. Accounting for axion production from strings prior to the QCD phase transition leads us to predict that the axion mass should be approximately $m_a\in(45,65)$ $\mu \mathrm{eV}$. However, we provide preliminary evidence that axions are produced in greater quantities from the string-domain-wall network collapse during the QCD phase transition, potentially increasing the mass prediction to as much as 300 $\mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory and Scalar Triplet Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the standard model with a real scalar triplet, $T$, including non-renormalizable operators (NROs) up to $d=6$. If $T$ is odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry, the neutral component of $T$ is a good candidate for the dark matter (DM) of the universe. We calculate the relic density and constraints from direct and indirect detection on such a setup, concentrating on the differences with respect to the simple model for a DM $T$ with only renormalizable interactions. Bosonic operators can change the relic density of the triplet drastically, opening up new parameter space for the model. Indirect detection constraints, on the other hand, rule out an interesting part of the allowed parameter space already today and future CTA data will, very likely, provide a decisive test for this setup.</description>

      <title>Off-shell vertices in heavy particle effective theories and $B\rightarrow D\pi \ell \nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modifications to decay amplitudes in heavy to heavy semileptonic decays with multiple hadrons in the final state due to intermediate heavy hadrons being off-shell or having a finite width. Combining Heavy Hadron Chiral Perturbation Theory (HH$\chi$PT) with a BCFW on-shell factorization formula, we show that these effects induce $O(1/M)$ corrections to the standard results computed in the narrow-width approximation and therefore are important in extracting form factors from data. A combination of perturbative unitarity, analyticity, and reparameterization invariance fully determine these corrections in terms of known Isgur-Wise functions without the need to introduce new form factors. In doing so, we develop a novel technique to compute the boundary term at complex infinity in the BCFW formula for theories with derivatively coupled scalars. While we have used the $\bar B\rightarrow D\pi \ell\nu$ decay as an example, these techniques can generally be applied to effective field theories with (multiple) distinct reference vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for dark matter and physics beyond the Standard Model has grown to encompass a highly interdisciplinary approach. In this review, we survey recent searches for light, weakly-coupled particles - axions and dark photons - over the past decade, focusing on new experimental results and the incorporation of technologies and techniques from fields as diverse as quantum science, microwave engineering, precision magnetometry, and condensed matter physics. We also review theoretical progress which has been useful in identifying new experimental directions, and identify the areas of most rapid experimental progress and the technological advances required to continue exploring the parameter space for axions and dark photons.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-standard neutrino interactions with neutral current events at long-baseline oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore, for the first time, {\textit{neutral-current}} events at long-baseline experiments to constrain vector and axial-vector neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) with quarks. We leverage the flavor dependence of NSIs to perform an oscillation analysis in the neutral-current channel. We first introduce a framework to parametrize the effect of NSI on the cross section. Then, as an example, we analyze NOvA neutral-current data which provides significantly improved constraints on the axial-vector NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}^A,~\varepsilon_{\tau\tau}^A$ and $\varepsilon_{e\mu}^A$. This is highly complementary to constraints from SNO data, which, differently from long-baseline neutral current data, is not sensitive to isospin conserving NSIs $\varepsilon^A_u=\varepsilon^A_d$. Additionally, we disfavor large values of the diagonal vectorial NSI $\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}^V$ and
  \varepsilon_{\tau\tau}^V$ which originate from the LMA-Dark solution. We also highlight the complementarity between NSI searches at oscillation experiments using charged current and neutral current channels.</description>

      <title>Electroweak spin-1 resonances in Composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite Higgs models predict the existence of various bound states. Among these are spin-1 resonances. We investigate models containing $\text{SU(2)}_L\times \text{SU(2)}_R$ as part of the unbroken subgroup in the new strong sector. These models predict that there are two neutral and one charged spin-1 resonances mixing sizably with the SM vector bosons. As a consequence, these can be singly produced in Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. We explore their rich LHC phenomenology and show that there are still viable scenarios consistent with existing LHC data where the masses of these states can be as low as about 1.5 TeV.</description>

      <title>Angular Distribution of Gamma Rays Produced in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of how high-energy proton-proton collisions produce gamma rays through the decays of pions and other secondaries is needed to correctly interpret astrophysical observations with the Fermi-LAT telescope. In the existing literature on cosmic-ray collisions with gas, the focus is on the gamma-ray yield spectrum, $d N_\gamma/dE$. However, in some situations, the joint energy and angular distribution can be observed, so one needs instead $d^2 N_\gamma/dE \, d\Omega$. We provide calculations of this distribution over the energy range from the pion production threshold to $100~{\rm GeV}$, basing our results on FLUKA simulations. We provide the results in tabular form and provide a Python tool on GitHub to aid in utilization. We also provide an approximate analytic formula that illuminates the underlying physics. We discuss simplified examples where this angular dependence can be observed to illustrate the necessity of taking the joint distribution into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) remains a major endeavor in modern physics investigation. Axions play essential roles in the quest to understand dark matter, the strong CP problem, and various astrophysical phenomena. This paper provides a very brief overview of the current status of experimental efforts, highlighting significant advancements, ongoing projects, and future opportunities. Particular attention is given to cavity haloscopes, helioscopes, and laboratory-based light-shining-through-wall experiments, as well as astrophysical probes. Some future perspectives are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-local material vacuum and Cherenkov radiation in non-linear massive $3$D-Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of electromagnetic field non-linearities in $3$ space-time dimensions. We focus on how these non-linearities influence permittivity and susceptibility. This, in turn, leads to changes in the refractive index through the use of the dispersion relation in the context of massless and massive non-linear electrodynamics. We also verify that, by inspecting the model addressed in the frequency/wave vector space, we identify the characteristics of a non-local material in the behavior of the vacuum, which exhibits a spatially-dispersive profile. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the cause of this phenomenon is the de Broglie-Proca mass term. We subsequently investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a moving charged particle interacting with a medium for massless and massive non-linear electrodynamics. Our findings indicate that the radiation is driven by the medium through which the particle travels, similar to what is observed in the Cherenkov effect.</description>

      <title>High Quality QCD Axion via Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel paradigm for the QCD axion with high-quality Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry on the basis of electric-magnetic duality in the conformal window of a supersymmetric gauge theory. PQ breaking fields, that contain the QCD axion, emerge in the magnetic theory and possess a large anomalous dimension, which leads to not only generation of an intermediate scale of spontaneous PQ breaking but also significant suppression of explicit PQ symmetry breaking operators. The high PQ quality and the absence of a Landau pole in the color gauge coupling are achieved. The parameter space to realize the correct abundance of the axion dark matter (DM) predicts explicit PQ violation which may be probed by future measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment. In the other viable parameter space, the lightest supersymmetric particle can become a DM candidate. Since the model naturally accommodates a mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature fluctuation, it provides a complete solution to the strong CP problem as well as the identity of DM.</description>

      <title>The curtain lowers on directly detectable higgsino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A higgsino could be some or all of the dark matter, with a mass bounded from above by about 1.1 TeV assuming a thermal freezeout density, and from below by collider searches. Direct detection experiments imply purity constraints on a dark matter higgsino, limiting the mixing with the electroweak gauginos. Using the new strong limits available as of the end of 2024 from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, I quantify the resulting lower bounds on gaugino masses and upper bounds on higgsino mass splittings, assuming that the scalar superpartners and Higgs bosons of minimal supersymmetry are in the decoupling limit. Similar bounds are projected for the critical future scenario that direct detection experiments reach the neutrino fog that hampers discovery prospects.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Electron Energy Spectrum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins.This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2)the spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV; (3) the spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>

      <title>Fast Flavor Pendulum: Instability Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in the absence of neutrino masses, a neutrino gas can exhibit a homogeneous flavor instability that leads to a periodic motion known as the fast flavor pendulum. A well-known necessary condition is a crossing of the angular flavor lepton distribution. However, in contrast to an earlier finding by two of us, the Nyquist criterion inspired by plasma physics, while being a more restrictive necessary condition, is not always sufficient. The question depends on the unstable branch of the dispersion relation being bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with subluminal phase velocity), in which case the Nyquist criterion is sufficient. While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed to be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real branch of the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical points exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple instability condition. We discuss the dispersion relation for the homogeneous mode in the more general context of modes with arbitrary wave number and stress that it plays no special role on this continuum, except for its regular but fragile long-term behavior owed to its many symmetries.</description>

      <title>NNLL Transverse Momentum Dependent evolution in the Parton Branching method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the preparation period for precision measurements in the newly planned collider experiments, the understanding of the 3D structure of hadron is becoming increasingly urgent. This triggers the activities to include elements of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization physics in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The method designed especially to address this need is the TMD Parton Branching (PB) method. The equivalence of the PB Sudakov form factor, both perturbative and non-perturbative, to the one of Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) is demonstrated and the recent development to increase the low-qt resummation precision of the PB Sudakov up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by using effective soft-gluon coupling is discussed. The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel is extracted from PB Drell-Yan (DY) predictions obtained with different modelling of radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the signal of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in Au+Au collisions and isobar collisions of $_{44}^{96}\text{Ru}+\rm{} _{44}^{96}Ru$ and $_{40}^{96}\text{Zr}+\rm{}_{40}^{96}Zr$ in the newly developed chiral anomaly transport (CAT) module based on the state-of-the-art model a multiphase transport (AMPT). Our numerical simulation results for the ratio charge correlation $\Delta\gamma$ in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions are close to the latest experimental data. The simulation shows that the CME signal is larger in Ru+Ru collisions than that in Zr+Zr collisions, while the background is smaller, and the upper limit of the CME signal is $15\%$ in the isobar collisions.</description>

      <title>Exclusive diffractive dijets at HERA and EIC using GTMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate differential distributions for diffractive production of dijets in $ep\rightarrow e^{'}p\,jet\,jet$ reaction using off diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions, often called GTMDs for brevity. Different models are used. We focus on the contribution to exclusive $q\bar{q}$ dijets.
  The results of our calculations are compared with the H1 and ZEUS data. Except of one GTMD, our results are below the HERA data points. This is in contrast with recent results where the normalization was adjusted to some selected distributions and no agreement with other observables was checked. We conclude that the calculated cross sections are only a small part of the measured ones which probably contain also processes with pomeron remnant, reggeon exchange, etc.
  We present also azimuthal correlations between the sum and the difference of dijet transverse momenta. The cuts on transverse momenta of jets generate azimuthal correlations (in this angle) which can be easily misinterpreted as due to so-called elliptic GTMD.</description>

      <title>Exploring the lifetime frontier with a beam-dump experiment at CiADS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a beam-dump experiment (BDE) at the upcoming facility of China initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS), called CiADS-BDE, in order to search for long-lived particles (LLPs) predicted in various beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) theories. The experiment is to be located in the forward direction of the incoming low-energy proton beam at CiADS, leveraging the strong forward boost of the produced particles at the beam dump in general. The space between the dump and the detector is largely available, allowing for installation of veto materials and hence low levels of background events. We elaborate on the detector setup, and choose dark photon as a benchmark model for sensitivity study. We restrict ourselves to the signature of an electron-positron pair, and find that with 5 years' operation, unique, currently unexcluded parts of the parameter space for $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV dark-photon masses and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9}\text{--}10^{-8})$ kinetic mixing can be probed at the CiADS-BDE. Furthermore, considering that there is no need to set up a proton beam specifically for this experiment and that the detector system requires minimal instrumentation, the experiment is supposed to be relatively cost-effective. Therefore, we intend this work to promote studies on the sensitivity reach of the proposed experiment to additional LLP scenarios, and in the end, the realization of the experiment. Incidentally, we study the sensitivity of the same BDE setups at the High Intensity Heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), presently under construction near the CiADS program site, and conclude that HIAF-BDE could probe new parameter regions, too.</description>

      <title>High-energy Coulomb scattering of spatially extended particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze pure Coulomb high-energy elastic scattering of charged particles (hadrons or nuclei), discarding their strong interactions. We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model.</description>

      <title>Two photon exchange corrections at large momentum transfer revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental data at large momentum transfer we update the analysis of the two-photon exchange effect in the electron-nucleon scattering using the effective field theory formalism. Our approach is suitable for describing the hard region, where the hadronic model calculations are not accurate enough. We improve the estimates of various long-range matrix elements and discuss the obtained numerical effects for the unpolarised elastic cross section. Assuming a linear behaviour of the reduced cross section with respect to the photon polarisation, we show that the obtained description allows us to resolve the form factor discrepancy for $Q^2=2.5-3.5$GeV$^2$. However, the effect obtained is quite small for higher values of $Q^2$. It is possible that nonlinear effects may be important in understanding the discrepancy in this region. Estimates of the elastic electron-neutron cross section in the region are also performed. The obtained TPE effects are sufficiently large and must be taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we discuss recent progress in associated top-quark pair production with one or two isolated photons, $pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma(\gamma)$. The focus is the simultaneous inclusion of higher-order effects and photon radiation in the production of the top-quark pair and in the decay processes. This allows us to quantify the importance of photon radiation in decay processes and the size of the so-called complete NLO corrections in realistic final states.</description>

      <title>A harmonic oscillator in nonadditive statistics and a novel transverse momentum spectrum in high-energy collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely observed that particles produced in high-energy collisions follow a power-law distribution. One such power-law distribution used extensively in the phenomenological studies owes its origin to nonadditive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this article, we derive a novel nonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using a single-mode harmonic oscillator. The approach taken in this paper eliminates the need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. We observe that the spectra of the bosonic particles like the pions and kaons produced in high-energy collisions are well-described by the nonadditive bosonic distribution derived in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of stability of the Higgs potential in the Standard Model is revisited employing advanced theoretical precision and recent experimental results. We show that the top mass and strong coupling constants are key observables in order to reach or refute absolute stability. We highlight new physics scenarios that lead to a decisive stabilisation of the Higgs sector. These proceedings summarise findings first reported in~[1,2].</description>

      <title>Non-singular solutions to the Boltzmann equation with a fluid Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological phase transitions can give rise to intriguing phenomena, such as baryogenesis or a stochastic gravitational wave background, due to nucleation and percolation of vacuum bubbles in the primordial plasma. A key parameter for predicting these relics is the bubble wall velocity, whose computation relies on solving the Boltzmann equations of the various species along the bubble profile. Recently it has been shown that an unphysical singularity emerges if one assumes these local quantities to be described as small fluctuations over a constant equilibrium background. In this work we solve this issue by including the spatial dependence of the background into the fluid Ansatz. This leads to a modification of the Boltzmann equation, and all terms that would give rise to a singularity now vanish. We recalculate the different contributions to the counter-pressure of the plasma on the expanding wall, and discuss their relative importance. The Standard Model with a low cutoff is chosen as benchmark model and the results are shown for different values of the cutoff scale $\Lambda$. In this setup, deflagration solutions are found for almost all the values of $\Lambda$ considered, while detonations are found only for some restricted corner of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional investigation of the pion pair-source in heavy-ion collisions with EPOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of femtoscopy is to unveil the space-time characteristics of heavy-ion collisions as mirrored in the correlation function of identical particles. We aim to augment such research by investigating the source function of particle creation based on a modern event generator, the EPOS package. It simulates high energy nuclear collisions and is proven to reliably reproduce the characteristics of real collisions. The source function has been almost always assumed to be Gaussian, but lately it is experimentally found that L\'evy-stable distributions provide a much more acceptable description. This paper focuses on the source shape that is reconstructed in a femtoscopic measurement, in particular, the event-by-event geometry as well as the deviation from spherical symmetry of the source in the EPOS simulation. Such an investigation tests some scenarios of the appearance of non-Gaussian source functions. We find that in such a realistic simulation, non-Gaussian sources indeed appear, even in a three-dimensional setting and without event averaging. However, our reconstructed L\'evy exponent (responsible for the long-range behavior of the source) is systematically larger than that observed in experiment; a discrepancy that might hint at further significance of this exponent.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Universal Extra-Dimension Model with Gravity Mediated Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the collider phenomenology of the fat-brane realization of the Minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model, where Standard Model (SM) fields propagate in a small extra dimension while gravity accesses additional large extra dimensions. This configuration allows for gravity-mediated decay (GMD) of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles, resulting in unique final states with hard photons, jets, massive SM bosons, and large missing transverse energy due to invisible KK gravitons. We derive updated constraints on the model's parameter space by recasting ATLAS mono-photon, di-photon, and multi-jet search results using 139 inverse femtobern of integrated luminosity data. Recognizing that current LHC search strategies are tailored for supersymmetric scenarios and may not fully capture the distinct signatures, we propose optimized strategies using machine learning algorithms to tag boosted SM bosons and enhance signal discrimination against SM backgrounds. These methods improve sensitivity to fat-brane mUED signatures and offer promising prospects for probing this model in future LHC runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze various problems related to the physics of hadrons under extreme conditions of temperature and chemical potentials. On the one hand, we show that the thermal resonances $f_0(500)$ and $K_0^*(700)$, generated in the framework of Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory $\pi\pi$ and $K\pi$ scattering at finite temperature, play an essential role concerning chiral and $U(1)_A$ restoration. On the other hand, a low-energy effective Lagrangian has been constructed within ChPT at non-zero chemical potential, which we discuss here for an axial chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Non-$D\bar{D}$ Decays into Light Meson Pairs of the $D$-Wave Charmonium $\psi_3(3842)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a $D$-wave partner of $\psi(3770)$ identified by the LHCb Collaboration, $\psi_3(3842)$ lies between the $D\bar{D}$ and $D\bar{D^*}$ thresholds. Its non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels have attracted considerable interest. In this study, we investigate these allowed non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ into $PP$, $PV$, and $VV$ final states using the hadronic loop mechanism, where $P$ and $V$ represent light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Our results suggest that these non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ can be significant, with contributions primarily driven by hadronic loops. Notably, the $\rho\pi$ channel stands out as the main non-$D\bar{D}$ decay mode, while non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels involving strange mesons are also sizable. These predictions could be tested in future experiments such as those at LHCb and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A future multi-TeV muon collider would provide an important probe for Majorana neutrinos. A muon collider with a collision energy of $\sim$30 TeV would be sensitive to $\nu_e-\nu_\mu$ transition dipole moments of the order of $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ and would be thus competitive with the latest astrophysical observation and laboratory experiments. Contrary to the latter, the muon collider would have the unique advantage of a direct and clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. This would establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino and would provide crucial complementary information on the neutrino properties in the event of a (near) future observation at low-energy experiments. Additionally, a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on the Majorana neutrino mass matrix entries $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially chiral stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can arise from various processes in the early Universe. The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporary chirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermionic matter, preserved as a quantum remnant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a surrogate loss to directly optimise the significance metric used in particle physics. We evaluate our loss function for a simple event classification task using a linear model and show that it produces decision boundaries that change according to the cross sections of the processes involved. We find that the models trained with the new loss have higher signal efficiency for similar values of estimated signal significance compared to ones trained with a cross-entropy loss, showing promise to improve sensitivity of particle physics searches at colliders.</description>

Abstract: We study the production of a Higgs boson in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b \bar b H$) at hadron colliders. Our calculation is performed in the four-flavour scheme with massive bottom quarks. This work presents the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections to this process, and we combine them with all-order radiative corrections from a parton shower simulation (NNLO+PS). The calculation is exact, except for the two-loop amplitude, which is evaluated in the small quark mass expansion, which is an excellent approximation for bottom quarks at LHC energies. For the NNLO+PS matching, we employ the MiNNLO$_{\rm PS}$ method for heavy-quark plus colour-singlet production within the POWHEG framework. We present an extensive phenomenological analysis both at the inclusive level and considering bottom jets using flavour-tagging algorithms. By comparing four-flavour and five-flavour scheme predictions at NNLO+PS, we find that the NNLO corrections in the four-flavour scheme resolve the long-standing tension between the two schemes. Finally, we show that our NNLO+PS predictions also have important implications on modelling the $b\bar b H$ background in Higgs-pair measurements.</description>

      <title>Interpolating amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in perturbation theory has reached a high degree of maturity, their usage to produce physical predictions within Monte Carlo programs is often hampered by the slow evaluation of the multi-loop amplitudes, especially so for amplitudes calculated numerically. As a remedy, interpolation frameworks have been successfully used in lower dimensions, but for higher-dimensional problems, such as the five dimensions of a 2 -&gt; 3 phase space, efficient and reliable solutions are sparse.
  This work aims to fill this gap by reviewing state-of-the-art interpolation methods, and by assessing their performance for concrete examples drawn from particle physics. Specifically, we investigate interpolation methods based on polynomials, splines, spatially adaptive sparse grids, and neural networks (multilayer perceptron and Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer). Our additional aim is to motivate further studies of the interpolation of scattering amplitudes among both physicists and mathematicians.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter, ultralight scalars, and cosmic neutrinos with gyroscope spin and precision clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) within the solar system induces deviations in the geodetic drift of gyroscope spin due to its gravitational interaction. Assuming a constant DM density as a minimal scenario, we constrain DM overdensity within the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) orbit and project limits for Earth's and Neptune's orbits around the Sun. The presence of electrons in gravitating sources and test objects introduces a scalar-mediated Yukawa potential, which can be probed using terrestrial and space--based precision clocks. We derive projected DM overdensity $(\eta)$ limits from Sagnac time measurements using onboard satellite clocks, highlighting their dependence on the source mass and orbital radius. The strongest limit, $\eta\lesssim 4.45\times 10^3$, is achieved at Neptune's orbit ($\sim 30~\mathrm{AU}$), exceeding existing constraints. Correspondingly, the cosmic neutrino overdensity is bounded as $\xi\lesssim 5.34\times 10^{10}$, surpassing results from KATRIN and cosmic ray studies. The best limit on electrophilic scalar coupling is $g\lesssim 7.09\times 10^{-24}$ for scalar mass $m_\varphi\lesssim 1.32\times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$ competitive with existing fifth-force bounds. These precision measurements offer a robust framework for testing gravity at solar system scales and probing DM in scenarios inaccessible to direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order evolution of structure functions without PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and numerically solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi~(DGLAP) evolution equations at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory directly for a basis of 6 physical, observable structure functions in deeply inelastic scattering. By expressing the evolution in the physical basis one evades the factorization scale and scheme dependence. Working in terms of observable quantities, rather than parametrizing and fitting unobservable parton distribution functions (PDFs), provides an unambiguous way to confront predictions of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics with experimental measurements. We compare numerical results for the DGLAP evolution for structure functions in the physical basis to the conventional evolution with PDFs.</description>

      <title>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $6\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

      <title>Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <title>On the construction of fuzzy dark matter halos with arbitrary initial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

      <title>The EFT of Large Spin Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use effective string theory to study mesons with large spin $J$ in large $N_c$ QCD as rotating open strings. In the first part of this work, we formulate a consistent effective field theory (EFT) for open spinning strings with light quarks. Our EFT provides a consistent treatment of the endpoints' singularities that arise in the massless limit. We obtain results, in a systematic $1/J$ expansion, for the spectrum of the leading and daughter Regge trajectories. Interestingly, we find that the redshift factor associated with the quarks' acceleration implies that the applicability regime of the EFT is narrower compared to that of static flux tubes. In the second part of this work, we discuss several extensions of phenomenological interests, including mesons with heavy quarks, the quarks' spin and the daughter Regge trajectories associated with the worldsheet axion, a massive string mode identified in lattice simulations of $4d$ flux tubes. We compare our predictions with $4d$ QCD spectroscopy data, and suggest potential $stringy$ interpretations of the observed mesons. We finally comment on the relation between the EFT spectrum and the Axionic String Ansatz, a recently proposed characterization of the spectrum of Yang-Mills glueballs.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled quintessential inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of early-time cosmic inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration within the context of a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. By employing an exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic plateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small field values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. We derive the inflationary predictions for the spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with current observational constraints. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark energy component with an equation of state $w_\phi$ approaching $-1$ but retaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational signature. This work demonstrates that a single theoretical framework can reconcile both early inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. Dynamical variables involve chiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the EFT, we briefly discuss spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the Goldstone modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarisability of octet baryons near the physical quark-mass point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic polarisabilities of octet baryons are calculated close to the physical quark-mass point using the background field method in lattice QCD. This first calculation draws on the identification and elimination of exceptional configurations that have hindered previous attempts. The origin of the exceptional configuration problem lies in the use of a Wilson-type fermion action on electro-quenched gauge field configurations, where the dynamical-fermion gauge-field generation algorithm the electric charges of the quarks. Changes in the fermion determinant that would suppress some gauge fields in the background magnetic field are neglected, leaving improbable gauge fields that generate large additive mass renormalisations which manifest as significant outliers in correlation-function distributions. An algorithm for the systematic identification and removal of these exceptional configurations is described. We find the light up and down quarks to be problematic, particularly the up quark with its larger electric charge. The heavier mass of the strange quark protects the hyperon correlation functions to some extent. However, these also benefit from the removal of exceptional configurations. In many cases, the magnetic polarisability is calculated with good precision. We find our results to be in accord with the behaviour anticipated by chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also confront the results obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ with that for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Moreover, it provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT's exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>Bubble dynamics in a QCD-like phase diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A line of first-order phase transitions is conjectured in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics at non-zero baryon density. If this is the case, numerical simulations of neutron star mergers suggest that various regions of the stars may cross this line multiple times. This results in the nucleation of bubbles of the preferred phase, which subsequently expand and collide. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is highly sensitively to the velocity of the bubble walls. We use holography to perform the first microscopic simulation of bubble dynamics in a theory that qualitatively mirrors the expected phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We determine the wall velocity in the metastable regions and we compare it to theoretical estimates. We discuss implications for gravitational wave production.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from patterns of electroweak symmetry breaking: an effective perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors would provide a promising probe for the new physics beyond the standard model that admits the first-order phase transitions. The predictions for the GW background vary sensitively among different concrete particle physics models but also share a large degeneracy in the model buildings, which motivates an effective model description on the phase transition based on different patterns of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In this paper, using the scalar $N$-plet model as a demonstration, we propose an effective classification for three different patterns of EWSB: (1) radiative symmetry breaking with classical scale invariance, (2) Higgs mechanism in generic scalar extension, and (3) higher dimensional operators. We conclude that a strong first-order phase transition could be realized for (1) and (2) with a small quartic coupling and a small isospin of an additional $N$-plet field for the light scalar field model with and without the classical scale invariance, and (3) with a large mixing coupling between scalar fields and a large isospin of the $N$-plet field for the heavy scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity, transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of open-heavy flavored hadron production in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV using PYTHIA8</title>

Abstract: Recently, with the upgradation of LHC, it is realized that study of heavy-flavored hadrons, namely $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and $\rm{D}^{0}$ in hadronic collisions, could reveal the possibility of thermalization of charm quarks. With this motivation, we study the production dynamics of these hadrons using a pQCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8 in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The production dynamics of these hadrons are analyzed through charged-particle multiplicity, transverse momentum, and pseudorapidity. With the help of the established PYTHIA8 tunes to mimic the behavior of flow-like features, we investigated the variation of effective temperature and degree of non-extensivity using thermodynamically consistent non-extensive Tsallis statistics. We further attempted to establish a connection between the initial state and final state by estimating the correlation between the number of multi-partonic interactions ($\rm{n}_{MPI}$) with the Knudsen number.</description>

Abstract: We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis using a factorized nuclear structure model incorporating individual nucleons and pairs of correlated nucleons. Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. Such successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure properties connecting nucleon- and parton-level quantities.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the extraction of physics beyond the Standard Model from electron scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise measurements of electron and positron scattering, including parity violation, offer great promise in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this context it is crucial to understand the corrections which might arise from charge symmetry violation, as well as the less well known strange and charm quark distributions. Our analysis, using state of the art parton distributions, suggests that these contributions lead to corrections in the extraction of the weak couplings $g^{eq}_{AV}$ and $g^{eq}_{VA}$ of the order $(1-2)\%$, while they are as large as $4\%$ for $g^{eq}_{AA}$, at a typical scale of $Q^2 = 10\ {\rm GeV}^2$. These results underline the importance of carrying out high precision measurements, which will not only provide information on physics beyond the Standard Model but also reduce the current uncertainties on our knowledge of the strange and charm quark distributions in the proton.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate, in the context of a scalar version of the chiral effective field theory, that the multi-sea quark contribution to the nucleon is significant and highly non-trivial in sharp contrast to the prediction of perturbation theory. The non-perturbative calculation is performed in the Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme on the light front, in which the non-perturbative renormalization is incorporated. The calculation suggests that a fully non-perturbative calculation of the chiral EFT is needed to obtain a robust result to be compared with the recent experimental measurement of flavor asymmetry in the proton.</description>

Abstract: The dark matter conundrum stands out as one of the central challenges to understand in both particle physics and cosmology. The ultralight axion-like particle (UALP) is an appealing dark matter candidate that can be searched for in neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we examine the interaction among neutrinos and a UALP; such interaction might induce violations of the Lorentz and $CPT$ symmetries. We assess the sensitivity to both the isotropic $CPT-$odd Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficients $(a_L)^T$ and effective neutrino-UALP couplings $\tilde{g}$ at the next-to-next generation neutrino oscillation experiment at the European Spallation Source (ESS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantitatively analyze a basic question: what is the stationary solution of the background plasma temperature profile around a black hole (BH)? One may naively expect that the temperature profile continuously decreases from the Hawking temperature at the surface of the BH towards an outer region. We show analytically and numerically that this is not the case because local thermal equilibrium cannot be maintained near the surface of the BH and also because the high-energy particles emitted from Hawking radiation cannot be instantaneously thermalized into the background plasma. The temperature profile has a plateau within a finite distance from the BH, and even the overall amplitude of background temperature at a distance far away from the BH is significantly suppressed compared with the naive expectation. The main reason for these counterintuitive results comes from the fact that the size of the BH is too small that particles of Hawking radiation goes far away within the typical time scale of interactions.</description>

      <title>Production potential of hidden-strange molecular pentaquarks through the $\pi^-p\rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, applying the effective Lagrangian approach, we investigate the reaction $\pi^-p\rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma$ to explore the production of the hidden-strange molecular pentaquarks $P_{s\bar{s}}$. Specifically, we analyze two scenarios, where the $J^P$ quantum numbers of $P_{s\bar{s}}$ are $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$. Our results show that the contribution from $s$-channel $P_{s\bar{s}}$ exchange dominates the total cross section, surpassing those from $t$-channel $K^{(*)}$ exchange and $u$-channel $\Sigma$ exchange. Additionally, we present predictions for the differential cross section of the $\pi^-p\rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma$ process. Finally, we extend the 2-to-2 scattering process to the 2-to-3 Dalitz process and provide theoretical predictions for this scenario. Our findings suggest that the cross section for the $\pi^-p \rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma\rightarrow K^+\pi^-\Sigma^0$ process can reach several tens of $\mu b$ near the threshold, making it highly favorable for experimental measurement. However, the current scarcity of experimental data for the $\pi^-p\rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma$ reaction at threshold energy limits our ability to determine the properties of the hidden-strange molecular pentaquarks $P_{s\bar{s}}$ and related physical quantities. Therefore, additional experimental measurements of the $\pi^-p \rightarrow K^{*}\Sigma$ reaction at threshold are strongly encouraged, and correlation studies could be pursued at facilities such as J-PARC, AMBER, and upcoming HIKE and HIAF meson beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>Systematics of U-Spin Sum Rules for Systems with Direct Sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rich mathematical structure underlying flavor sum rules has been discovered recently. In this work, we extend these findings to systems with a direct sum of representations. We prove several results for the general case. We derive an algorithm that enables the determination of all $U$-spin amplitude sum rules at arbitrary order of the symmetry breaking for any system containing a direct sum of the representations $0 \oplus 1$. Potential applications are numerous and include, for example, higher order sum rules for CP-violating charm decays with an arbitrary number of final states.</description>

      <title>Relativistic BEC extracted from a complex FRG flow equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>

      <title>Status of tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K after Neutrino 2024 and possible role of non-standard neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work we have shown that the data presented by the two long-baseline accelerator experiments NO$\nu$A and T2K at the Neutrino 2020 conference displayed a tension, and that it could be alleviated by non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) of the flavor changing type involving the $e-\mu$ or the $e-\tau$ sectors with couplings $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \sim |\varepsilon_{e\tau}|\sim 0.1$. As a consequence a hint in favor of NSI emerged. In the present paper we reassess the issue in light of the new data released by the two experiments at the Neutrino 2024 conference. We find that the tension in the determination of the standard CP-phase $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ extracted by the two experiments in the normal neutrino mass ordering persists and has a statistical significance of $\sim2\sigma$. Concerning the NSI, we find that including their effects in the fit, the two values of $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ preferred by NO$\nu$A and T2K return in very good agreement. The current statistical significance of the hint of non zero NSI is $\sim1.8\sigma$. Further experimental data are needed in order to settle the issue.</description>

      <title>Charged current neutrino scattering from nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the charged current induced neutrino and antineutrino scattering from the free nucleon target. This study has been performed in the energy range of a few GeV, relevant for the (anti)neutrino oscillation experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. For a few GeV neutrino, the contribution to the cross section mainly comes from the quasielastic, the inelastic production of mesons like pion, kaon, eta, and hyperons as well as from the deep inelastic scattering by the weak currents in $\Delta S$=0 and $\Delta S$=1 sectors. The numerical results are presented for the $Q^2$ distribution of the differential cross section for all the aforementioned processes. The effect of the cut on the center of mass energy $W$ has been explicitly discussed.</description>

      <title>50 years of Neutrino Physics at Aligarh Muslim University</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An overview of the significant contributions made by the Aligarh group in the field of neutrino physics has been provided. The group's work began with the study of quasielastic neutrino scattering on deuterium, specifically the process $\nu_\mu + d \rightarrow \mu^- + p +p$, focusing on moderate neutrino energies within the impulse approximation framework in order to analyze the early experiments at ANL and BNL with deuterium filled bubble chambers. These studies were later extended to numerically calculate (anti)neutrino interaction cross sections for the inclusive quasielastic scattering from nuclei using local density approximation~(LDA), incorporating nucleon-nucleon correlations for moderate to heavy nuclear targets. The inelastic scattering cross sections for one pion production and the deep inelastic scattering~(DIS) from nuclei have been obtained using LDA with multi nucleon correlation effects. In the case of single pion production, the final state interaction of the pions with the residual nucleus has also been taken into account. In addition, the group has explored other inelastic processes of kaon and eta meson production, in the (anti)neutrino interactions with the nucleon targets. Furthermore, we have investigated electron and positron scattering off proton targets in the intermediate energy range, focusing on polarization observables and T-noninvariance. Our research has also delved into polarized electron scattering to explore the possibility of observing parity-violating asymmetry (PVA) in elastic and deep inelastic scattering, among other related topics. The group has also contributed to the study of atmospheric neutrino flux in the cosmic ray interactions, relevant for various sites of the neutrino oscillation experiments with atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Towards unifying perturbative and Holographic Light-Front QCD via holomorphic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a QCD coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ in the Effective Charge (ECH) scheme of the canonical part $d(Q^2)$ of the (inelastic) polarised Bjorken Sum Rule (BSR) ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$. In the perturbative domain, the coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ practically coincides with the perturbative coupling $a(Q^2)$ [$\equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$] in the four-loop ECH renormalisation scheme. In the deep infrared (IR) regime, ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ behaves as suggested by the Holographic Light-Front QCD up to the second derivative. Furthermore, in contrast to its perturbative counterpart $a(Q^2)$, the coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ is holomorphic in the entire complex $Q^2$-plane with the exception of the negative semiaxis, reflecting the holomorphic properties of the BSR observable $d(Q^2)$ [or: ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$] as dictated by the general principles of the Quantum Field Theory. It turns out that the obtained coupling, used as ECH, reproduces quite well the experimental data for ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$ in the entire $N_f=3$ regime $0 &lt; Q^2 \lesssim 5 \ {\rm GeV}^2$.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule analysis of $0^{+}$ four-quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {We present a comprehensive QCD sum rules analysis at next-to-leading order for all types of $J^P=0^{+}$ four-quark states composed of $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. The eigenvectors of the renormalization matrix are chosen to be the renormalized four-quark operators, which can be equally interpreted as tetraquark or molecule operators. Meanwhile, the typical nonet masses given by bare tetraquark operators are lower than those given by bare molecule operators. Most of the nonet masses are around $1-2\text{GeV}$, and they can be interpreted as the $0^+$ mesons observed in experiments. We find a category of four-quark nonets with masses $\lesssim1\text{GeV}$, potentially corresponding to the light $0^+$ mesons $f_0(500)$, $K^*_0(700)$, $f_0(980)$, and $a_0(980)$. On the other hand, the possible 27-fold states are heavier than most of the nonets, with masses $\gtrsim 2\text{GeV}$. The main uncertainty arises from the factorization of high-dimensional condensates, which usually underestimates their values. To address this, we introduce deviation factors for the dimension-6, -8, and -10 condensates, and vary them over a wide range to obtain conservative estimates of the $0^+$ four-quark state masses. Some general properties of the $0^+$ light four-quark states can be derived that do not rely on precise numerical values. We also find that the ambiguity in the factorization of the dimension-8 condensate can introduce a larger discrepancy than previously estimated. As a byproduct, we propose a simple trick for renormalizing multi-quark operators at the one-loop level.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff:Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, $\gamma$ gamma-rays) from photon targets, $\gamma^*$ virtual photons in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the $\gamma\gamma^*\to\pi^0$ production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of ~250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. A short description is presented of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. Here, we focus on a review of Primakoff Scattering studies of pion polarizability and the $\gamma\to\pi\pi\pi$ chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, and of the {\pi}0 lifetime at Jefferson Laboratory (Jlab). Following a brief review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), we discuss the good agreement of the results of these studies with 2-flavor $(u,d)$ ChPT predictions. We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER for kaon polarizability and $\gamma\to\pi\pi\eta$ and $\gamma\to KK\pi$ chiral anomalies and kaonic hybrid states, and at Jlab for the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ lifetimes, are important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor $(u,d,s)$ ChPT. The transition from 2-flavor to 3-flavor ChPT incorporates the strange quark, which is crucial for understanding the full dynamics of the light mesons (pions, kaons, and etas). By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the FCNC couplings between the top quark and the photon in $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma^{*}\gamma^{*}$ collisions at the CLIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of flavour-changing neutral current transitions(FCNC) involving the top quark are only possible with new theoretical frameworks that extend the Standard Model(SM), given that these transitions are almost entirely suppressed within the SM. In this regard, examining these transitions with extended theories beyond the SM may provide significant insights into future experiments. To this end, we present a phenomological study about the anomalous FCNC transitions via $tq\gamma$ couplings with effective field theory. Here, ${\gamma \gamma}{\rightarrow} {\textit{l}} {\nu}_\textit{l} b \bar{q} $ , ${e^{+}} {e^{-}} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} {\gamma}^{} {\gamma}^{} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} \textit{l}{} {\nu_\textit{ l}} b \bar{q} {e^{-}} $, $\gamma \gamma {\rightarrow} j \bar{j} b \bar{q} $ and ${e^{+}} {e ^{-}} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} {\gamma}^{} {\gamma}^{} {e^{-}} {\rightarrow}{e^{+}} j \bar{j} b \bar{q} {e^{-}} $ processes are investigated for the CLIC at $\sqrt{s} =1.5$TeV and 3 TeV. Thus, we have calculated the constraints at $95{\%}$ confidence level on the $BR(t\rightarrow q\gamma)$. As a result, the obtained constraints are at least one order of magnitude better than the available experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization, Fermions, and Mod 8 Periodicity</title>

Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), time reversal (T), and fermion parity $(-1)^{\rm F}$ are basic discrete spacetime and internal symmetries of the Dirac fermions. In this article, we determine the group, called the C-R-T fractionalization, which is a group extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm C}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm R}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm T}$ by the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, and its extension class in all spacetime dimensions $d$, for a single-particle fermion theory. For Dirac fermions, with the canonical CRT symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm CRT}$, the C-R-T fractionalization has two possibilities that only depend on spacetime dimensions $d$ modulo 8, which are order-16 nonabelian groups, including the famous Pauli group. For Majorana fermions, we determine the R-T fractionalization in all spacetime dimensions $d=0,1,2,3,4\mod8$, an order-8 abelian or nonabelian group. For Weyl fermions, we determine the C or T fractionalization in all even spacetime dimensions $d$, which is an order-4 abelian group. We only have an order-2 $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ group for Majorana-Weyl fermions. We determine the maximal number of linearly independent Dirac and Majorana mass terms and construct them explicitly. We also discuss how the conventional Dirac and Majorana mass terms break the symmetries C, R, or T. We study the domain wall dimensional reduction of the fermions and their C-R-T fractionalization: from $d$-dim Dirac to $(d-1)$-dim Dirac or Weyl and from $d$-dim Majorana to $(d-1)$-dim Majorana or Majorana-Weyl.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$ fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$ GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$ GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS }$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with theoretical systematic errors under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs by complementing our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Quark Matter in Massive Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high baryon densities ($\rho_B$) in a quark star (QS). The QS is built from the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM model), modified (MDDQM model) to obtain a higher maximum gravitational mass ($\rm M_{max}$) of the QS, using the data from observed pulsars: HESS J1731$-$347, PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, and PSR J0952$-$0607 as constraints in Bayesian inference to determine the model parameters. The parameters yielding a quark matter (QM) equation of state that generates $\rm M_{max} &gt; 2M_\odot$ violate the near-conformality conditions analyzed at high $\rho_B$. This behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the increasing quark population with $\rho_B$, along with the simultaneous formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, both of which are influenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\rho_B$ rises. This is reflected in the MDDQM model employed, which introduces an additional term that becomes significant at high densities. On the other hand, parameters that yield $\rm M_{max} &lt; 2M_\odot$ conform to the expected near-conformal behavior at higher densities, as analyzed.</description>
