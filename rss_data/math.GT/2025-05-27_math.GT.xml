      <title>A Z-structure for the mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a boundary for the mapping class group Mod(S) of a surface S of finite type. The action of Mod(S) on this boundary is minimal, strongly proximal and topologically free. The boundary is the boundary of a Z-structure for any torsion free finite index subgroup of Mod(S).</description>

      <title>A classification of rational 3-tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the \textit{normal form} and \textit{normal coordinate} of a rational 3-tangle $T$ with respect to $\partial E_1$, where $E_1$ is the fixed two punctured disk in $\Sigma_{0,6}$. Among all normal coordinates of $T$ with respect to $\partial E_1$, we investigate the collection of \textit{minimal} normal coordinates of $T$. We show that the simplicial complex constructed with normal forms of the rational 3-tangle is contractible. As an effectiveness of the contractibility of the simplicial complex by normal forms of $T$, we would choose a minimal normal coordinate of $T$ with a certain rule for the representative for the rational $3$-tangle $T$. This classifies rational $3$-tangles up to isotopy.</description>

      <title>Skein theory for the Links-Gould polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building further on work of Marin and Wagner, we give a braid-type skein theory of the Links-Gould polynomial invariant of oriented links, prove that it can be used to evaluate any oriented link and prove that it is also shared by the $V_1$-polynomial defined by two of the authors, deducing the equality of the two link polynomials. This implies specialization properties of the $V_1$-polynomial to the Alexander polynomial and to the $\mathrm{ADO}_3$-invariant, the fact that it is a Vassiliev power series invariant, as well as a Seifert genus bound for knots.</description>

      <title>On Heegaard Floer minimal knots in sutured manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-Xie-Zhang classified instanton Floer minimal knots in balanced sutured manifolds subject to a condition on the fundamental group. In this paper, we give a similar classification in the Heegaard Floer homology setting. Since our classifications agree when they are both applicable, this provides further evidence for the conjecture of Kronheimer-Mrowka that instanton Floer homology and Heegaard Floer homology are isomorphic. We also study link Floer homology botany question in $S^1\times S^2$, showing that link Floer homology detects spherical braid closures among homologically nontrivial links.</description>

      <title>Handle decompositions and stabilizations of open books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build handle decompositions of n-manifolds that encode given open book decompositions and describe handle slides that reveal new open book decompositions on the same underlying manifold, for $n \geq 3$. This recovers known stabilization operations for open books. As an application, we show that any open book with trivial monodromy can be stabilized to an open book whose page is a boundary connected sum of trivial disk bundles over spheres.</description>

      <title>Biorderability of knot quandles of knots up to eight crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates biorderability of knot quandles of prime knots up to eight crossings. We prove that knot quandles of knots $6_3$, $8_7$, $8_8$, $8_{10}$ and $8_{16}$ can not be biorderable. However, we see that knot quandles of knots $4_1$, $6_1$, $6_2$, $7_6$, $7_7$, $8_1$, $8_2$, $8_3$, $8_4$, $8_5$, $8_6$, $8_9$, $8_{11}$, $8_{12}$, $8_{13}$, $8_{14}$, $8_{17}$, $8_{18}$, $8_{20}$ and $8_{21}$ could be biorderable. We also give linear orders on the generating set of the knot quandle of a knot (among these knots) that could be extendable to biorders on the quandle.</description>

      <title>A prescribed curvature flow on hyperbolic surfaces with infinite topological type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the prescribed total geodesic curvature problem for generalized circle packing metrics in hyperbolic background geometry on surfaces with infinite cellular decompositions. To address this problem, we introduce a prescribed curvature flow-a discrete analogue of the Ricci flow on noncompact surfaces-specifically adapted to the setting of infinite cellular decompositions. We establish the well-posedness of the flow and prove two convergence results under certain conditions. Our approach resolves the prescribed total geodesic curvature problem for a broad class of surfaces with infinite cellular decompositions, yielding, in certain cases, smooth hyperbolic surfaces of infinite topological type with geodesic boundaries or cusps. Moreover, the proposed flow provides a method for constructing hyperbolic metrics from appropriate initial data.</description>

      <title>Dense and empty BNSR-invariants of the McCool groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An automorphism of the free group $F_n$ is called pure symmetric if it sends each generator to a conjugate of itself. The group $\mathrm{PSAut}_n$ of all pure symmetric automorphisms, and its quotient $\mathrm{PSOut}_n$ by the group of inner automorphisms, are called the McCool groups. In this paper we prove that every BNSR-invariant $\Sigma^m$ of a McCool group is either dense or empty in the character sphere, and we characterize precisely when each situation occurs. Our techniques involve understanding higher generation properties of abelian subgroups of McCool groups, coming from the McCullough-Miller space. We also investigate further properties of the second invariant $\Sigma^2$ for McCool groups, using a general criterion due to Meinert for a character to lie in $\Sigma^2$.</description>

      <title>Topological Complexity of symplectic CW-complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cohomology class u of a topological space X is atoroidal if its pullback to the torus vanishes for every map from a torus to X. Furthermore, X is atoroidally symplectic if there is an atoroidal cohomology class $u\in H^2(X;F)$ such that $u^n$ is non-zero. We prove that every atoroidally symplectic CW-complex X of dimension 2n has topological complexity 4n.
  This generalizes a result of Grant and Mescher who prove the corresponding statement in the case where X is an atoroidally c-symplectic manifold and u is a de Rham cohomology class. Using this generalisation, we obtain new calculations of topological complexity, including for many products of 3-manifolds and of group presentation complexes.</description>

      <title>Explicit classes in Habiro cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a cycle description of the Habiro cohomology of a smooth variety $X$
  over the spectrum $B$ of an \'etale $Z[\lambda]$-algebra and construct explicit
  nontrivial cycles using either the Picard-Fuchs equation on $X/B$
  of a hypergeometric motive, or a push-forward of elements
  of the Habiro ring of $X/B$. In particular, we give explicit classes for
  1-parameter Calabi--Yau families.
  The $q$-hypergeometric origin of our cycles imply
  that they generate $q$-holonomic modules that define $q$-deformations of the
  classical Picard-Fuchs equation. We illustrate our theorems with three examples:
  the Legendre family of elliptic
  curves, the $A$-polynomial curve of the figure eight knot, and
  for the quintic three-fold, whose $q$-Picard Fuchs equation appeared in
  its genus $0$-quantum $K$-theory. Our methods give a unified treatment of
  quantum $K$-theory and complex Chern-Simons theory around higher dimensional
  critical loci.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>

Abstract: We show that infinite cyclic subgroups of groups acting uniformly properly on injective metric spaces are uniformly undistorted. In the special case of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, we use this to study translation lengths for actions on the associated hyperbolic spaces. We then use quasimorphisms to produce examples where these latter results are sharp.</description>

Abstract: We give some new link detection results for link Floer homology, Khovanov homology and annular Khovanov homology. The links we detect arise via different closure operations on $3$-braids. Examples of our results include that link Floer homology detects the Mazur link, that annular Khovanov homology detects the Mazur pattern, and that Khovanov homology detects L6a2 and L9n15. The Mazur pattern detection result depends on a new bound on the rank of the annular Khovanov homology of certain links.</description>

      <title>Embeddable of hieroglyphs into torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in finding combinatorial criteria for embedding graphs into two-dimensional torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known fact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops and is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs in some surface is equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph with rotation structure (not necessarily geometric) or rotation graph called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph in the torus; (2) the absence of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ that recognizes embedding hieroglyph in the torus.</description>

Abstract: In projectivized strata of meromorphic $1$-forms on elliptic curves with only one zero, the locus of residueless differentials is a complex curve endowed with a canonical complex projective structure. Drawing on the multi-scale compactification of strata, we provide formulas to compute the genus of these curves and the degree of their natural forgetful map to $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$. Additionally, we distinguish two non-hyperelliptic components in the residueless locus of the exceptional stratum $\mathcal{H}_{1}(12,-3,-3,-3,-3)$ and hence complete the classification of the connected components of these loci.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by a result of Babillot. We obtain a higher-rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which exhibits exponential expansion along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_p$ denote the Hecke group where $p=2r$, $r&gt;0$. Let $\mathcal{N}_l$ denote the set of conjugacy classes of reciprocal elements of word length $l$ in $\Gamma_p$. We prove that for $l \to \infty$,
  $$|\mathcal{N}_l| = \mathcal{O}\left(\left\lfloor \tfrac{l+1}{2} \right\rfloor^{s-1} \rho^{\left\lfloor \tfrac{l+1}{2} \right\rfloor} \right),
  $$
  where $\mathcal O$ is the `big O', $\rho \in [\sqrt{2}, 2]$ is the unique positive real root of
  $$
  p(x) = x^{r+1} - 2\sum_{j=1}^{r-1} x^{r-j} - 1,
  $$
  and $s$ is the maximal multiplicity among the roots of $p(x)$.
  Our method relies on the free product structure of the Hecke group $\Gamma_p$, a combinatorial counting function, and recurrence relations derived from cyclically reduced representatives. We also derive that the growth rate of the primitive reciprocal classes of word length $l$ is in agreement with that of $\mathcal{N}_l$. This work generalizes previous results for odd $p$ and provides an explicit asymptotic bound for all Hecke groups.</description>
