      <title>A Spectral Representation of a Weighted Random Vectorial Field: Potential Applications to Turbulence and the Problem of Anomalous Dissipation in the Inviscid Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak{G}}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $vol(\mathfrak{G})\sim L^{3}$. Let ${\mathscr{T}}(x)$ be a Gaussian random field $\forall~x\in\mathfrak{G}$ with expectation $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{T}}(x)]=0$ and correlation $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{T}}(x)\otimes{\mathscr{T}}(y)]=K(x,y;\lambda)$, an isotropic and regulated kernel with correlation length $\lambda$. The field has a Karhunen-Loeve spectral representation ${\mathscr{T}}(x)=\sum_{I=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{Z}^{1/2}_{I}f_{I}(x)\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{I}$, with eigenvalues $\lbrace\mathrm{Z}_{I}\rbrace$, eigenfunctions $\lbrace f_{I}(x)\rbrace $ and Gaussian random variables $\mathscr{Z}_{I}$ with $\mathbf{E}[\mathscr{Z}_{I}]=0$ and $\mathbf{E}[\mathscr{Z}_{I}\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{J}]=\delta_{IJ}$. If $\mathfrak{G}$ contains incompressible fluid of viscosity $\nu$ with velocity $u_{a}(x,t)$ that evolves via the Navier-Stokes equations with a high 'Reynolds function' $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)=\tfrac{\|u_{a}(x,t)\|L}{\nu} $ then aspects of a turbulent flow with $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)\gg \mathsf{RE}_{*}$, a critical Reynolds number, might be represented by the 'weighted' random field $\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)= u_{a}(x,t)+\mathrm{A}u_{a}(x,t)\big(\mathsf{RE}(x,t)-\mathsf{RE}_{*}\big)^{\beta}\sum_{I=1}^{\infty} \mathrm{Z}^{1/2}_{I}f_{I}(x)\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{I}$ where random fluctuations and amplitude scale nonlinearly with $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)$, with mean $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{U}}_{a}(x,t)] =u_{a}(x,t)$. In the inviscid limit one can prove an anomalous dissipation-type law \begin{align} \lim_{\nu\rightarrow 0}\bigg(\lim_{u_{a}(x,t)\rightarrow {u}_{a}}\sup~\nu \int_{\mathfrak{G}}\int_{0}^{T}{\mathbf{E}}\bigg[\bigg|{\nabla}_{a}{\mathscr{U}}_{a}(x,s)\bigg|^{2}\bigg]d\mathcal{V}(x) ds\bigg)&gt;0 \end{align} iff $\beta=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\sum_{I=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{Z}_{I}\int_{{\mathfrak{G}}}{\nabla}_{a}f_{I}(x){\nabla}^{a}f_{I}(x)d\mathcal{V}(x)&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: We first prove a mimicking theorem (also known as a Markovian projection theorem) for the marginal distributions of an Ito process conditioned to not have exited a given domain. We then apply this new result to the proof of a conjecture of P.L. Lions for the optimal control of conditioned processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of stochastic processes, with a particular focus on Markov chains and jump processes. The main results related to queuing systems are analyzed. Additionally, conditions that ensure the stability, or ergodicity, of such systems are presented. The paper also discusses stability results for queuing networks and their extension to visiting systems. Finally, key contributions concerning the Probability Generating Function, an essential tool in the analysis of the aforementioned processes, are introduced. The review is conducted from the perspective of queuing theory, grounded in the Kendall-Lee notation, emphasizing stability results and the computation of performance measures based on the specific characteristics of each process.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study notions of hyperuniformity for invariant locally square-integrable point processes in regular trees. We show that such point processes are never geometrically hyperuniform, and if the diffraction measure has support in the complementary series then the process is geometrically hyperfluctuating along all subsequences of radii. A definition of spectral hyperuniformity and stealth of a point process is given in terms of vanishing of the complementary series diffraction and sub-Poissonian decay of the principal series diffraction near the endpoints of the principal spectrum. Our main contribution is providing examples of stealthy invariant random lattice orbits in trees whose number variance grows strictly slower than the volume along some unbounded sequence of radii. These random lattice orbits are constructed from the fundamental groups of complete graphs and the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Finely Divisible Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of stochastic matrices that have a stochastic $c$-th root for infinitely many natural numbers $c$ is introduced and studied. Such matrices are called arbitrarily finely divisible, and generalise the class of infinitely divisible matrices. In particular, if $A$ is a transition matrix for a Markov process over some time period, then arbitrarily finely divisibility of $A$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of transition matrices corresponding to this Markov process over arbitrarily short periods.
  In this paper, we lay the foundation for research into arbitrarily finely divisible matrices and demonstrate the concepts using specific examples of $2 \times 2$ matrices, $3 \times 3$ circulant matrices, and rank-two matrices.</description>

      <title>Regularisation by multiplicative noise for reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in $1+1$ dimensions driven by multiplicative space-time white noise, with a distributional drift belonging to a Besov-H\"older space with any regularity index larger than $-1$. We assume that the diffusion coefficient is a regular function which is bounded away from zero. By using a combination of stochastic sewing techniques and Malliavin calculus, we show that the equation admits a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependent rough SDEs with applications to rough PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize Krylov's theory on parameter-dependent stochastic differential equations to the framework of rough stochastic differential equations (rough SDEs), as initially introduced by Friz, Hocquet and L\^e. We consider a stochastic equation of the form $$ dX_t^\zeta = b_t(\zeta,X_t^\zeta) \ dt + \sigma_t(\zeta,X_t^\zeta) \ dB_t + \beta_t (\zeta,X_t^\zeta) d\mathbf{W}_t,$$ where $\zeta$ is a parameter, $B$ denotes a Brownian motion and $\mathbf{W}$ is a deterministic H\"older rough path. We investigate the conditions under which the solution $X$ exhibits continuity and/or differentiability with respect to the parameter $\zeta$ in the $\mathscr{L}$-sense, as defined by Krylov.
  As an application, we present an existence-and-uniqueness result for a class of rough partial differential equations (rough PDEs) of the form $$-du_t = L_t u_t dt + \Gamma_t u_t d\mathbf{W}_t, \quad u_T =g.$$ We show that the solution admits a Feynman--Kac type representation in terms of the solution of an appropriate rough SDE, where the initial time and the initial state play the role of parameters.</description>

      <title>On the number of elements beyond the ones actually observed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a variant of the birth and death chain with constant intensities, originally introduced by
  Bruno de Finetti way back in 1957, is revisited. This fact is also underlined by the choice of the title,
  which is clearly a literal translation of the original one. Characteristic of the variant is that it
  allows negative jumps of any magnitude. And this, as explained in the paper, might be useful in offering
  some insight into the issue, arising in numerous situations, of inferring the number of the undetected
  elements of a given population. One thinks, for example, of problems concerning abundance or richness of
  species.
  The author's purpose is twofold: to align the original de Finetti's construction with the modern,
  well-established theory of the continuous-time Markov chains with discrete state space and show how it
  could be used to make probabilistic previsions on the number of the unseen elements of a population.
  With the aim of enhancing the possible practical applications of the model, one discusses the statistical
  point estimation of the rates which characterize its infinitesimal description.</description>

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Bures-Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the large deviations principle for empirical Bures-Wasserstein barycenters of independent, identically-distributed samples of covariance matrices and covariance operators. As an application, we explore some consequences of our results for the phenomenon of dimension-free concentration of measure for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters. Our theory reveals a novel notion of exponential tilting in the Bures-Wasserstein space, which, in analogy with Cr\'amer's theorem in the Euclidean case, solves the relative entropy projection problem under a constraint on the barycenter. Notably, this method of proof is easy to adapt to other geometric settings of interest; with the same method, we obtain large deviations principles for empirical barycenters in Riemannian manifolds and the univariate Wasserstein space, and we obtain large deviations upper bounds for empirical barycenters in the general multivariate Wasserstein space. In fact, our results are the first known large deviations principles for Fr\'echet means in any non-linear metric space.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Points of Fusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work explores fusions, the multidimensional counterparts of mean-preserving contractions and their extreme and exposed points. We reveal an elegant geometric/combinatorial structure for these objects. Of particular note is the connection between Lipschitz-exposed points (measures that are unique optimizers of Lipschitz-continuous objectives) and power diagrams, which are divisions of a space into convex polyhedral ``cells'' according to a weighted proximity criterion. These objects are frequently seen in nature--in cell structures in biological systems, crystal and plant growth patterns, and territorial division in animal habitats--and, as we show, provide the essential structure of Lipschitz-exposed fusions. We apply our results to several questions concerning categorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bony's paraproduct is one of the main tools in the theory of paracontrolled calculus. The paraproduct is usually defined via Fourier analysis, so it is not a local operator. In the previous researches [7, 8], however, the author proved that the pointwise estimate like (1.2) holds for the paraproduct and its iterated versions when the sum of the regularities is smaller than 1. The aim of this article is to extend these results for higher regularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of zeroes of trigonometric polynomials under repeated differentiation. We show that if the zeroes of a real-rooted, degree $d$ trigonometric polynomial are distributed according to some probability measure $\nu$ in the large $d$ limit, then the zeroes of its $[2td]$-th derivative, where $t&gt;0$ is fixed, are distributed according to the free multiplicative convolution of $\nu$ and the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$. In the simplest special case, our result states that the zeroes of the $[2td]$-th derivative of the trigonometric polynomial $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^{2d}$ (which can be thought of as the trigonometric analogue of the Laguerre polynomials) are distributed according to the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$, in the large $d$ limit. The latter distribution is defined in terms of the function $\zeta=\zeta_t(\theta)$ which solves the implicit equation $\zeta - t \tan \zeta = \theta$ and satisfies $$ \zeta_t(\theta)= \theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta +\ldots))), \qquad \mathrm{Im}\, \theta &gt;0, \;\; t&gt;0. $$</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems for Smooth Optimal Transport Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the central objects in the theory of optimal transport is the Brenier map: the unique monotone transformation which pushes forward an absolutely continuous probability law onto any other given law. A line of recent work has analyzed $L^2$ convergence rates of plugin estimators of Brenier maps, which are defined as the Brenier map between density estimators of the underlying distributions. In this work, we show that such estimators satisfy a pointwise central limit theorem when the underlying laws are supported on the flat torus of dimension $d \geq 3$. We also derive a negative result, showing that these estimators do not converge weakly in $L^2$ when the dimension is sufficiently large. Our proofs hinge upon a quantitative linearization of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, which may be of independent interest. This result allows us to reduce our problem to that of deriving limit laws for the solution of a uniformly elliptic partial differential equation with a stochastic right-hand side, subject to periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for an open facilitated exclusion process with slow and fast boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetric facilitated exclusion process (FEP) on the finite one-dimensional lattice $\lbrace 1,\dots ,N-1\rbrace$ when put in contact with boundary reservoirs, whose action is subject to an additional kinetic constraint in order to enforce ergodicity, and whose speed is of order $N^{-\theta}$ for some parameter $\theta$. We derive its hydrodynamic limit as $N\to\infty$, in the diffusive space-time scaling, when the initial density profile is supercritical. More precisely, the macroscopic density of particles evolves in the bulk according to a fast diffusion equation as in the periodic case, which is now subject to boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type depending on the parameter $\theta$. In the Dirichlet case, the FEP exhibits a very peculiar behaviour: unlike for the classical SSEP, and due to the two-phased nature of FEP, the reservoirs impose boundary densities which do not coincide with their equilibrium densities. The proof is based on the classical entropy method, but requires significant adaptations to account for the FEP's non-product stationary states and to deal with the non-equilibrium setting.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. Finally, to demonstrate the significance of our framework, we propose a new projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm that provably accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Wigner-Gurau limit for random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a combinatorial approach for studying moments of the resolvent trace for random tensors proposed by Razvan Gurau. Our work is based on the study of hypergraphs and extends the combinatorial proof of moments convergence for Wigner's theorem. This also opens up paths for research akin to free probability for random tensors.
  Specifically, trace invariants form a complete basis of tensor invariants and constitute the moments of the resolvent trace. For a random tensor with entries independent, centered, with the right variance and bounded moments, we prove the convergence of the expectation and bound the variance of the balanced single trace invariant. This implies the universality of the convergence of the associated measure towards the law obtained by Gurau in the Gaussian case, whose limiting moments are given by the Fuss-Catalan numbers. This generalizes Wigner's theorem for random tensors.
  Additionally, in the Gaussian case, we show that the limiting distribution of the $k$-times contracted $p$-order random tensor by a deterministic vector is always the Wigner-Gurau law at order $p-k$, dilated by $\sqrt{\binom{p-1}{k}}$. This establishes a connection with the approach of random tensors through the matrix study of the $p-2$ contractions of the tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups in the case where each random walk step need not be supported on a generating set of the group. When the supports of the random walk steps satisfy a natural condition involving normal subgroups of quotients of the group, we show that the random walk converges to the uniform distribution on the group and give bounds for the convergence rate using spectral properties of the random walk steps. As an application, we prove a universality theorem for cokernels of random integer matrices allowing some dependence between entries.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and non-hyperuniformity of zeros of Gaussian Weyl-Heisenberg Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study zero sets of twisted stationary Gaussian random functions on the complex plane, i.e., Gaussian random functions that are stochastically invariant under the action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. This model includes translation invariant Gaussian entire functions (GEFs), and also many other non-analytic examples, in which case winding numbers around zeros can be either positive or negative. We investigate zero statistics both when zeros are weighted with their winding numbers (charged zero set) and when they are not (uncharged zero set). We show that the variance of the charged zero statistic always grows linearly with the radius of the observation disk (hyperuniformity). Importantly, this holds for functions with possibly non-zero means and without assuming additional symmetries such as radiality. With respect to uncharged zero statistics, we provide an example for which the variance grows with the area of the observation disk (non-hyperuniformity). This is used to show that, while the zeros of GEFs are hyperuniform, the set of their critical points fails to be so. Our work contributes to recent developments in statistical signal processing, where the time-frequency profile of a non-stationary signal embedded into noise is revealed by performing a statistical test on the zeros of its spectrogram (``silent points''). We show that empirical spectrogram zero counts enjoy moderate deviation from their ensemble averages over large observation windows (something that was previously known only for pure noise). In contrast, we also show that spectogram maxima (``loud points") fail to enjoy a similar property. This gives the first formal evidence for the statistical superiority of silent points over the competing feature of loud points, a fact that has been noted by practitioners.</description>

      <title>On the Precision of the Spectral Profile Bound for the Mixing Time of Continuous State Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sharpness of the spectral profile bound presented by Goel et al. and Chen et al. on the $L^{2}$ mixing time of Markov chains on continuous state spaces. We show that the bound provided by Chen et al. is sharp up to a factor of $\log\log$ of the initial density. This result extends the findings of Kozma, which showed the analogous result for the original spectral profile bound of Goel et al. for Markov chains on finite state spaces. Kozma shows that the spectral profile bound is sharp up to a multiplicative factor of $\log(\log(\pi_{min}))$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the smallest value of the probability mass function of the stationary distribution. We discuss the application of our primary finding to the comparison of Markov chains. Our main result can be used as a comparison bound, indicating that it is possible to compare chains even when only non-spectral bounds exist for a known chain.</description>

      <title>Metastability of the contact process on slowly evolving scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the contact process on scale-free networks evolving by a stationary dynamics whereby each vertex independently updates its connections with a rate depending on its power. This rate can be slowed down or speeded up by virtue of decreasing or increasing a parameter $\eta$, with $\eta\downarrow-\infty$ approaching the static and $\eta\uparrow\infty$ the mean-field case. We identify the regimes of slow, fast and ultra-fast extinction of the contact process. Slow extinction occurs in the form of metastability, when the contact process maintains a certain density of infected states for a time exponential in the network size. In our main result we identify the metastability exponents, which describe the decay of metastable densities as the infection rate goes to zero, in dependence on $\eta$ and the power-law exponent $\tau$. While the fast evolution cases have been treated in a companion paper, Jacob, Linker, M\"orters (2019), the present paper looks at the significantly more difficult cases of slow network evolution. We describe various effects, like degradation, regeneration and depletion, which lead to a rich picture featuring numerous first-order phase transitions for the metastable exponents. To capture these effects in our upper bounds we develop a new martingale based proof technique combining a local and global analysis of the process.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for the bottom singular vector of rectangular random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rectangular random matrix $X=(x_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ whose entries are iid with tail $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We consider the regime $N(n)/n\to \mathsf{a}&gt;1$ as $n$ tends to infinity. Our main interest lies in the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value, which we will refer to as the "bottom singular vector", denoted by $\mathfrak{u}$. In this paper, we prove the following phase transition regarding the localization length of $\mathfrak{u}$: when $\alpha&lt;2$ the localization length is $O(n/\log n)$; when $\alpha&gt;2$ the localization length is of order $n$. Similar results hold for all right singular vectors around the smallest singular value. The variational definition of the bottom singular vector suggests that the mechanism for this localization-delocalization transition when $\alpha$ goes across $2$ is intrinsically different from the one for the top singular vector when $\alpha$ goes across $4$.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical System View of Langevin-Based Non-Convex Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-convex sampling is a key challenge in machine learning, central to non-convex optimization in deep learning as well as to approximate probabilistic inference. Despite its significance, theoretically there remain many important challenges: Existing guarantees (1) typically only hold for the averaged iterates rather than the more desirable last iterates, (2) lack convergence metrics that capture the scales of the variables such as Wasserstein distances, and (3) mainly apply to elementary schemes such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. In this paper, we develop a new framework that lifts the above issues by harnessing several tools from the theory of dynamical systems. Our key result is that, for a large class of state-of-the-art sampling schemes, their last-iterate convergence in Wasserstein distances can be reduced to the study of their continuous-time counterparts, which is much better understood. Coupled with standard assumptions of MCMC sampling, our theory immediately yields the last-iterate Wasserstein convergence of many advanced sampling schemes such as proximal, randomized mid-point, and Runge-Kutta integrators. Beyond existing methods, our framework also motivates more efficient schemes that enjoy the same rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mean-field dynamics of stochastic McKean differential equations with heterogeneous particle interactions described by large network structures. To express a wide range of graphs, from dense to sparse structures, we incorporate the recently developed graph limit theory of graphops into the limiting McKean--Vlasov equations. Global stability of the splay steady state is proven via a generalized entropy method, leading to explicit graph-structure dependent decay rates. We highlight the robustness of the entropy approach by extending the results to the closely related Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with intrinsic frequency distribution. We also present central examples of random graphs, such as power law graphs and the spherical graphop, and analyze the limitations of the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>Faster algorithms for the alignment of sparse correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph ensemble is a probability law on pairs of graphs with $n$ vertices, parametrized by their average degree $\lambda$ and their correlation coefficient $s$. It can be used as a benchmark for the graph alignment problem, in which the labels of the vertices of one of the graphs are reshuffled by an unknown permutation; the goal is to infer this permutation and thus properly match the pairs of vertices in both graphs. A series of recent works has unveiled the role of Otter's constant $\alpha$ (that controls the exponential rate of growth of the number of unlabeled rooted trees as a function of their sizes) in this problem: for $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ and $\lambda$ large enough it is possible to recover in a time polynomial in $n$ a positive fraction of the hidden permutation. The exponent of this polynomial growth is however quite large and depends on the other parameters, which limits the range of applications of the algorithm. In this work we present a family of faster algorithms for this task, show through numerical simulations that their accuracy is only slightly reduced with respect to the original one, and conjecture that they undergo, in the large $\lambda$ limit, phase transitions at modified Otter's thresholds $\sqrt{\widehat{\alpha}}&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$, with $\widehat{\alpha}$ related to the enumeration of a restricted family of trees.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization with Heterogeneous Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study decision problems under uncertainty, where the decision-maker has access to $K$ data sources that carry {\em biased} information about the underlying risk factors. The biases are measured by the mismatch between the risk factor distribution and the $K$ data-generating distributions with respect to an optimal transport (OT) distance. In this situation the decision-maker can exploit the information contained in the biased samples by solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, where the ambiguity set is defined as the intersection of $K$ OT neighborhoods, each of which is centered at the empirical distribution on the samples generated by a biased data source. We show that if the decision-maker has a prior belief about the biases, then the out-of-sample performance of the DRO solution can improve with $K$ -- irrespective of the magnitude of the biases. We also show that, under standard convexity assumptions, the proposed DRO problem is computationally tractable if either $K$ or the dimension of the risk factors is kept constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotics of Wide Remedians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remedian uses a $k\times b$ matrix to approximate the median of $n\leq b^{k}$ streaming input values by recursively replacing buffers of $b$ values with their medians, thereby ignoring its $200(\lceil b/2\rceil / b)^{k}%$ most extreme inputs. Rousseeuw &amp; Bassett (1990) and Chao &amp; Lin (1993); Chen &amp; Chen (2005) study the remedian's distribution as $k\rightarrow\infty$ and as $k,b\rightarrow\infty$. The remedian's breakdown point vanishes as $k\rightarrow\infty$, but approaches $(1/2)^{k}$ as $b\rightarrow\infty$. We study the remedian's robust-regime distribution as $b\rightarrow\infty$, deriving a normal distribution for standardized (mean, median, remedian, remedian rank) as $b\rightarrow\infty$, thereby illuminating the remedian's accuracy in approximating the sample median. We derive the asymptotic efficiency of the remedian relative to the mean and the median. Finally, we discuss the estimation of more than one quantile at once, proposing an asymptotic distribution for the random vector that results when we apply remedian estimation in parallel to the components of i.i.d. random vectors.</description>
