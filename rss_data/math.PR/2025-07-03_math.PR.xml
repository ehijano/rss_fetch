      <title>Law of the Iterated Logarithm for Markov Semigroups with Exponential Mixing in the Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the law of the iterated logarithm for a wide class of non-stationary, continuous-time Markov processes evolving on Polish spaces. Specifically, our results apply to additive functionals of processes governed by stochastically continuous Markov-Feller semigroups that exhibit exponential mixing and non-expansiveness in the Wasserstein norm, provided that a suitable moment condition on the initial distributions is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Disintegration theorem for multifunctions, with applications to empirical Wasserstein distances and average-case statistical bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalisation of the disintegration theorem to the setting of multifunctions between Polish probability spaces. Whereas the classical disintegration theorem guarantees the disintegration of a probability measure along the partition of the underlying space by the fibres of a measurable function, our theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the measure to disintegrate along a cover of the underlying space defined by the fibres of a measurable multifunction. Building on this theorem, we introduce a new statistical notion: We declare a metric Polish probability space to be asymptotically disintegrable if $n$ i.i.d.-centred balls of decreasing radius carry a disintegration of the measure with probability tending to unity as $n\rightarrow\infty$. We give a number of both $1$-dimensional and higher-dimensional examples of asymptotically disintegrable spaces with associated quantitative rates, as well as a strong counterexample. Finally, we give two applications of the notion of asymptotic disintegrability. First, we prove that asymptotically disintegrable spaces admit an easy high-probability quantification of the law of large numbers in Wasserstein space, which in all dimensions either recovers or improves upon the best known rates in some regimes, and is never any worse than existing rates by more than a factor of 2 in the exponent of $n$, where $n$ is the number of sample points. Second, we prove that any asymptotically disintegrable space admits a high-probability bound on the error in approximating the expectation of any Lipschitz function by its empirical average over an i.i.d.\ sample. The bound is average-case in the sense that it depends only on the empirical average of the local Lipschitz constants of the function, rather than the global Lipschitz constant as obtained by Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality.</description>

      <title>On Iterated Lorenz Curves with Applications: The Bivariate Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a Lorenz curve, derived from the distribution function of a random variable, can itself be viewed as a probability distribution function of a new random variable [2]. In a previous work of ours [3], we proved the surprising result that a sequence of consecutive iterations of this map leads to a non-corner case convergence, independent of the initial random variable. Namely, the limiting distribution follows a power-law distribution. In this paper, we generalize our result to the bivariate setting. We do so using Arnold's type definition [2] of a Lorenz curve, which offers the greatest parsimony among its counterparts. The situation becomes more complex in higher dimensions as the map affects not only the marginals but also their dependence structure. Nevertheless, we prove the equally surprising result that under reasonable restrictions, the marginals again converge uniformly to a power-law distribution, with an exponent equal to the golden section. Furthermore, they become independent in the limit. To emphasize the multifaceted nature of the problem and broaden the scope of potential applications, our approach utilizes a variety of mathematical tools, extending beyond very specialized methods.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QSSEP, short for quantum symmetric simple exclusion process, is a paradigm model for stochastic quantum dynamics. Averaging over the noise, the quantum dynamics reduce to the well-studied SSEP (symmetric simple exclusion process). These notes provide an introduction to quantum exclusion processes, focusing on the example of QSSEP and its connection to free probability, with an emphasis on mathematical aspects.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Sandpile model: exact sampling and complete graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Stochastic Sandpile Model on finite graphs, with two main results. First, we describe a procedure to exactly sample from the stationary distribution of the model in all connected finite graphs, extending a result obtained by Levine and Liang for Activated Random Walks. Then, we study the model on the complete graph with a number of vertices tending to infinity and show that the stationary density tends to $1/2$. Along the way, we introduce a new point of view on the dynamics of the model, with active and sleeping particles, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Mind the jumps: when 2BSDEs meet semi-martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an aggregated version of the value processes associated with stochastic control problems, where the criterion to optimise is given by solutions to semi-martingale backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The results can be applied to control problems where the triplet of semi-martingale characteristics is controlled in a possibly non-dominated case or where uncertainty about the characteristics is present in the optimisation. The construction also provides a time-consistent system of fully nonlinear conditional expectations on the Skorokhod space. We find the semi-martingale decomposition of the value function and characterise it as the solution to a semi-martingale second-order BSDE. The generality we seek allows for the treatment of controlled diffusions, pure-jump processes, and discrete-time processes in a unified setting.</description>

      <title>Martingales and Path-Dependent PDEs via Evolutionary Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a semigroup-theoretic framework for the analytic characterisation of martingales with path-dependent terminal conditions. Our main result establishes that a measurable adapted process of the form \[ V(t) - \int_0^t\Psi(s)\, ds \] is a martingale with respect to an expectation operator $\mathbb{E}$ if and only if a time-shifted version of $V$ is a mild solution of a final value problem involving a path-dependent differential operator that is intrinsically connected to $\mathbb{E}$. We prove existence and uniqueness of strong and mild solutions for such final value problems with measurable terminal conditions using the concept of evolutionary semigroups. To characterise the compensator $\Psi$, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb{E}$-derivative of $V$, which in special cases coincides with Dupire's time derivative. We also compare our findings to path-dependent partial differential equations in terms of Dupire derivatives such as the path-dependent heat equation.</description>

      <title>Deep BSVIEs Parametrization and Learning-Based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their reflected extensions, which naturally arise in problems with time inconsistency, path dependent preferences, and recursive utilities with memory. These equations generalize classical BSDEs by involving two dimensional time structures and more intricate dependencies.
  We begin by developing a well posedness and measurability framework for BSVIEs in product probability spaces. Our approach relies on a representation of the solution as a parametrized family of backward stochastic equations indexed by the initial time, and draws on results of Stricker and Yor to ensure that the two parameter solution is well defined in a joint measurable sense.
  We then introduce a discrete time learning scheme based on a recursive backward representation of the BSVIE, combining the discretization of Hamaguchi and Taguchi with deep neural networks. A detailed convergence analysis is provided, generalizing the framework of deep BSDE solvers to the two dimensional BSVIE setting. Finally, we extend the solver to reflected BSVIEs, motivated by applications in delayed recursive utility with lower constraints.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions for coupled reaction-diffusion systems with pattern formation by a stochastic fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical and biochemical reactions can exhibit surprisingly different behaviours, ranging from multiple steady-state solutions to oscillatory solutions and chaotic behaviours. These types of systems are often modelled by a system of reaction-diffusion equations coupled by a nonlinearity. In the article, we study the existence of stochastically perturbed equations of this type. In particular, we show the existence of a probabilitic weak solution of the following stochastic system \begin{align*} \dot {u} &amp; = r_1\,\Delta u+ a_1\, u + b_1 -c_1\, u\cdot v^q+\sigma_1\, g_1(u)\circ \dot W_1, \\ \dot{v} &amp; = r_2 \,A v + a_2\, v + b_2 +c_2\, u\cdot v^q + \sigma_2\, g_2(v)\circ \dot W_2, \end{align*} where $r_i,b_i,c_i, \sigma_i&gt;0$, $a_i\in\mathbb{R}$, and $g_i$ are linear, $i=1,2$, and the exponent $q\geq 1$. The operator $A=-(-\Delta)^{\aleph/2}$ is a fractional power of the Laplacian, $1&lt;\aleph \le2$. The main result is obtained by a Schauder-Tychonoff type fixed point theorem for the controlled versions of the laws of the respective (infinite dimensional) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck system, from which we infer the existence of a weak solution of the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Soliton Synchronization with Randomness: Rogue Waves and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Learned Sparse Grid Quadrature Rules using NeuralODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a proof of the consistency of sparse grid quadrature for numerical integration of high dimensional distributions. In a first step, a transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the network capacity is increased adaptively.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Tensor-Based Deferral of Gaussian Splitting for Orbit Uncertainty Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting. This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting. Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three representative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit, and a periodic three-body orbit.</description>

      <title>Regularity Conditions for Critical Point Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on a sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$, defined on a compact manifold with boundary $S$, converging in the $C^k$ metric to a limit $f$. A common assumption implicitly made in the empirical sciences is that when such functions represent random processes derived from data, the topological features of $f_n$ will eventually resemble those of $f$. In this work, we investigate the validity of this claim under various regularity assumptions, with the goal of finding conditions sufficient for the number of local maxima, minima and saddle of such functions to converge. In the $C^1$ setting, we do so by employing lesser-known variants of the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf and mountain pass theorems, and in the $C^2$ setting we pursue an approach inspired by the homotopy-based proof of the Morse Lemma. To aid practical use, we end by reformulating our central theorems in the language of the empirical processes.</description>

      <title>Faber polynomials in a deltoid region and power iteration momentum methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a region in the complex plane enclosed by a deltoid curve inscribed in the unit circle, and define a family of polynomials $P_n$ that satisfy the same recurrence relation as the Faber polynomials for this region. We use this family of polynomials to give a constructive proof that $z^n$ is approximately a polynomial of degree $\sim\sqrt{n}$ within the deltoid region. Moreover, we show that $|P_n| \le 1$ in this deltoid region, and that, if $|z| = 1+\varepsilon$, then the magnitude $|P_n(z)|$ is at least $\frac{1}{3}(1+\sqrt{\varepsilon})^n$, for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We illustrate our polynomial approximation theory with an application to iterative linear algebra. In particular, we construct a higher-order momentum-based method that accelerates the power iteration for certain matrices with complex eigenvalues. We show how the method can be run dynamically when the two dominant eigenvalues are real and positive.</description>

      <title>Spacetime reconstruction by order and number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the random adjacency matrices induced by the chronological relations and i.i.d. samples of two spacetimes coincide in law if and only if the spacetimes in question are smoothly isometric. A similar result holds for weighted spacetimes. In the smooth framework of our article, this relaxes the hypotheses of the recent Gromov reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian signature by Braun-S\"amann from a.s. isometry of the respective time separation functions to a.s. order isometry. In a probabilistic way, our result makes a key paradigm of causal set theory rigorous: spacetime can be recovered by only knowing "order" and "number" of its points. It confirms a weak version of Bombelli's conjecture; therefore, it contributes to recent efforts of formalizing the Hauptvermutung (viz. fundamental conjecture) of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks using hybrid models of transcriptional bursting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell data reveal the presence of biological stochasticity between cells of identical genome and environment, in particular highlighting the transcriptional bursting phenomenon. To account for this property, gene expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies that may emerge from interactions between genes.</description>

      <title>A Strong Duality Principle for Equivalence Couplings and Total Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of duality for two classes of optimization problems commonly occurring in probability theory. That is, on an abstract measurable space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$, we consider pairs $(E,\mathcal{G})$ where $E$ is an equivalence relation on $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{G}$ is a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{G}$; we say that $(E,\mathcal{F})$ satisfies "strong duality" if $E$ is $(\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{F})$-measurable and if for all probability measures $\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}'$ on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ we have $$\max_{A\in\mathcal{G}}\vert \mathbb{P}(A)-\mathbb{P}'(A)\vert = \min_{\tilde{\mathbb{P}}\in\Pi(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}')}(1-\tilde{\mathbb{P}}(E)),$$ where $\Pi(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{P}')$ denotes the space of couplings of $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{P}'$, and where "max" and "min" assert that the supremum and infimum are in fact achieved. The results herein give wide sufficient conditions for strong duality to hold, thereby extending a form of Kantorovich duality to a class of cost functions which are irregular from the point of view of topology but regular from the point of view of descriptive set theory. The given conditions recover or strengthen classical results, and they have novel consequences in stochastic calculus, point process theory, and random sequence simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the directed polymer model in the weak disorder phase under the assumption that the partition function is $L^p$-bounded for some $p&gt;1+\frac{2}d$. We prove that the point-to-point partition function can be approximated by two point-to-plane partition functions at the startpoint and endpoint, and in particular that it is $L^p$-bounded as well. Some consequences of this result are also discussed, the most important of which is a local limit theorem for the polymer measure. We furthermore show that the required $L^p$-boundedness holds for some range of $\beta$ beyond the $L^2$-critical point, and in the whole interior of the weak disorder phase for environments with finite support.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d\geq 3$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge in law to the same limit. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to hold throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>Conformal covariance of connection probabilities in the 2D critical FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study connection probabilities between vertices of the square lattice for the critical random-cluster (FK) model with cluster weight 2, which is related to the critical Ising model. We consider the model on the plane and on domains conformally equivalent to the upper half-plane. We prove that, when appropriately rescaled, the connection probabilities between vertices in the domain or on the boundary have nontrivial limits, as the mesh size of the square lattice is sent to zero, and that those limits are conformally covariant. This provides an important step in the proof of the Delfino-Viti conjecture for FK-Ising percolation as well as an alternative proof of the conformal covariance of the Ising spin correlation functions. In an appendix, we also derive new exact formulas for some Ising boundary spin correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity of the Lorentz mirror walk in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Lorentz mirror walk in dimension $d\geq 2$, mirrors are randomly placed on the vertices of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at density $p\in[0,1]$. A light ray is then shot from the origin and deflected through the various mirrors in space. The object of study is the random trajectory obtained in this way, and it is of upmost interest to determine whether these trajectories are localized (finite) or delocalized (infinite). A folklore conjecture states that for $d=2$ these trajectories are finite for any density $p&gt;0$, while in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and for $p&gt;0$ small enough some trajectories are infinite. In this paper we prove that for all dimensions $d\geq 4$ and any small density $p$, the trajectories behave diffusively at all polynomial time scales $t\approx p^{-M}$ with $M&gt;1$, and in particular, they do not close by this time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies have widely demonstrated that neural networks are highly sensitive to small, adversarial perturbations of the input. The worst-case robustness against these so-called adversarial examples can be quantified by the Lipschitz constant of the neural network. In this paper, we study upper and lower bounds for the Lipschitz constant of random ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we assume that the weights and biases follow a generalization of the He initialization, where general symmetric distributions for the biases are permitted. For deep networks of fixed depth and sufficiently large width, our established upper bound is larger than the lower bound by a factor that is logarithmic in the width. In contrast, for shallow neural networks we characterize the Lipschitz constant up to an absolute numerical constant that is independent of all parameters.</description>

      <title>A Trek Rule for the Lyapunov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21223v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov equation is a linear matrix equation characterizing the cross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process. We show a new version of the trek rule for this equation, which links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to the entries of the steady-state covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power series expansion of the covariance matrix in the entries of the drift and volatility matrices. For acyclic models it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of the drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas for the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift matrix. These results illustrate notable differences between covariance models entailed by the Lyapunov equation and those entailed by linear additive noise models. To further explore differences and similarities between these two model classes, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound on the marginal variances in the acyclic case. This sheds light on the phenomenon, well known for the linear additive noise model, that the variances in the acyclic case tend to increase along a topological ordering of the variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the topology of a wireless network using limited observational data. Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence in the Free Multiplicative Central Limit Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence in the free multiplicative central limit theorem (CLT), in terms of the Kolmogorov and $r$-Wasserstein distances for $r \geq 1$. While the free additive CLT has been thoroughly studied, including convergence rates, the multiplicative setting remained open in this regard. We consider products of the form $$ \pi_n^{g,n^{-1/2}x} := g\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \cdots g\left(\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$ where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are freely independent self-adjoint operators with common variance $\sigma^2$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies certain regularity and integrability conditions. We quantify the deviation of the singular value distribution of $\pi_n^{g,x}$ from the free positive semicircular law, with bounds depending only on the moments of the underlying variables. Additionally, we present a combinatorial proof of the free multiplicative CLT that extends to the unbounded setting.</description>

      <title>Littlewood--Paley estimates for pure-jump Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the recent generalization of the Hardy--Stein identity to extend the previous Littlewood--Paley estimates to general pure-jump Dirichlet forms. The results generalize those for symmetric pure-jump L\'evy processes in Euclidean spaces. We also relax the assumptions for the Dirichlet form necessary for the estimates used in previous works. To overcome the difficulty that It\^o's formula is not applicable, we employ the theory of Revuz correspondence and additive functionals. Meanwhile, we present a few counterexamples demonstrating that some inequalities do not hold in the generality considered in this paper. In particular, we correct errors that appear in previous works.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description>
