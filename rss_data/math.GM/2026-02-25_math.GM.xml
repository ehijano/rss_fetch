      <title>Quantile-Based Skewness for Fuzzy Numbers with Probabilistic Foundations: With an Application in Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parameter free skewness coefficient for fuzzy numbers, addressing a critical gap in quantifying asymmetry under imprecision. Existing fuzzy literature substitutes membership functions for probability density functions in moment-based skewness, lacking rigorous theoretical grounding. Our coefficient, however, rigorously establishes a probabilistic foundation, making it both probabilistically meaningful and fully compliant with the semantics of fuzzy set theory. Our approach interprets a fuzzy number's left and right membership function components as cumulative and survival probability functions of associated random variables. This provides a robust probabilistic foundation for its $\alpha$-cuts as generalized quantiles representing values that are "at least $\alpha$-probable", thereby instantiating the well-grounded dualism between probability and possibility theory. As a quantile-based measure, the proposed coefficient offers invariance under scale and location transformations. Crucially, its superior computational efficiency, empirically demonstrating an almost logarithmic reduction in portfolio optimization processing time with increasing assets, enables significant scalability for real-world applications. The coefficient comprises two complementary constituents: an "inner" measure quantifying the intrinsic skewness of the underlying probabilistic distributions, and an "outer" measure capturing the fuzzy number's overall profile asymmetry. This dual structure offers nuanced insights into a fuzzy number's asymmetry. We demonstrate its practical utility and computational advantages within a fuzzy mean-variance-skewness portfolio optimization framework, comparing its performance with two of the most highly cited original moment-based fuzzy skewness coefficients from the literature.</description>

      <title>On the Failure of Step-Response Tests to Certify Admissibility of Spectral Averaging Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study translation-invariant smoothing operators on finite cyclic groups Z/NZ, expressed as periodic convolutions and analyzed via the discrete Fourier transform on Z/NZ. Step responses are widely used as a practical diagnostic for whether a smoothing operator preserves bounded ranges, for example whether it maps signals in [0,1]^N back into [0,1]^N. We show step-based diagnostics can be fundamentally misleading for periodic convolution operators. First, we give a sharp characterization: a constant-preserving periodic convolution maps [0,1]^N into [0,1]^N if and only if its convolution kernel is componentwise nonnegative, equivalently each row of the associated matrix is a probability vector. The proof is constructive and yields worst-case witnesses in {0,1}^N together with certified lower bounds on the magnitude of boundedness violation. We then analyze three standard Fourier-domain averaging constructions, Fejer (Ces\`aro) averaging, sharp spectral truncation, and a signed spectral control, and demonstrate a Nyquist-adjacent blind spot: at cutoff K = Nyquist - 1, the canonical step can exhibit essentially zero overshoot while the operator remains strongly non-admissible, with explicit binary inputs yielding outputs below 0 and above 1. Reproducible artifacts and a self-contained demo are provided.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling in the Textile Industry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model, describing some different weaving structures, is made in this article. The terms self-mirror and rotation-stable weaving structure are initiated here. There are used the properties and operations in the set of the binary matrices and an equivalence relation in this set. Some combinatorial problems about finding the cardinal number and the elements of the factor set according to this relation is discussed. We propose an algorithm, which solves these problems. The presentation of an arbitrary binary matrix using sequence of nonnegative integers is discussed. It is shown that the presentation of binary matrices using ordered n-tuples of natural numbers makes the algorithms faster and saves a lot of memory. Implementing these ideas a computer program, which receives all of the examined objects, is created. In the paper we use object-oriented programming using the syntax and the semantic of C++ programming language. Some advantages in the use of bitwise operations are shown. The results we have received are used to describe the topology of the different weaving structures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic zero distribution of the polynomials $\widetilde{\Xi}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the polynomials $\Xi_n$ introduced in~\cite{TallaWaffo2025arxiv2511.02843} and studied in further details in\cite{TallaWaffo2026arxiv2602.16761}, which are expressed in terms of Eulerian polynomials of type~B, and study the zero distribution of the rescaled family \[
  \widetilde{\Xi}_n(x) := \Xi_n(\sqrt{x}), \qquad n\ge 2. \] Writing the zeros of $\widetilde{\Xi}_n$ in the interval $(0,1)$ as $0&lt; x_{n,1} \le \cdots \le x_{n,n-1} &lt; 1$ and forming the empirical measures \[
  \mu_n := \frac1{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\delta_{x_{n,k}}, \] we prove that $(\mu_n)_{n\ge2}$ converges weakly to a deterministic probability measure $\mu$ supported on $(0,1)$. We give an explicit formula for the limiting density and the limiting distribution function of~$\mu$. The proof is based on a representation of $\Xi_n$ in terms of type~B Eulerian polynomials, a ratio asymptotic for these polynomials derived from a classical series identity, and the Stieltjes transform method. We also provide numerical experiments illustrating the convergence of the empirical zero distributions to~$\mu$.</description>

      <title>Sums of three Fibonacci numbers as concatenations of three repdigits in base $b$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate sums of three Fibonacci numbers that can be expressed as concatenations of three repdigits in base $b$, where $b\ge 2$ is an integer. We prove that for bases $2\le b\le 10$, only finitely many such sums exist, and we determine all of them explicitly. Among these solutions, the largest occurs for $b=4$ and is given by $$ F_{42}+F_{29}+F_{20}=268435290=\overline{33333333331122}_4. $$</description>

      <title>A Formal Group Perspective on the Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formal group--theoretic framework for the Riemann zeta function by treating its Euler product as an element of the multiplicative formal group $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m$ and its logarithm as the associated formal group logarithm. This provides a purely algebraic linearization of the multiplicative prime-wise structure of the Euler product.
  Starting from a finite cutoff model, we introduce a formal completion via evenization and a natural normalization procedure. The resulting logarithmic expansion exhibits a Gaussian leading term, while higher-order terms form a hierarchy of cumulants. We show that this Gaussian structure is not probabilistic in origin, but arises from the infinitesimal quadratic geometry of the multiplicative formal group after linearization. The higher cumulants encode arithmetic deviations and admit a decomposition governed by weighted integrals of the Chebyshev error function $\theta(x)-x$.
  A systematic formal group axiomatization is then provided, placing the cutoff model and cumulant hierarchy within a coherent algebraic framework. The approach is deliberately non-spectral, focusing on a structural reorganization of the Euler product rather than on operator-theoretic realizations of zeros. We briefly indicate possible connections with absolute arithmetic and geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$.</description>
