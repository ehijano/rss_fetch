      <title>Inconsistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is known that parsimony can be statistically inconsistent under certain models of evolution due to high levels of homoplasy, the consistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) is less well studied. Previous studies have shown the consistency of concatenated parsimony (parsimony applied to concatenated alignments) under the MSC for the rooted 4-taxa case under an infinite-sites model of mutation; on the other hand, other work has also established the inconsistency of concatenated parsimony for the unrooted 6-taxa case. These seemingly contradictory results suggest that concatenated parsimony may fail to be consistent for trees with more than 5 taxa, for all unrooted trees, or for some combination of the two. Here, we present a technique for computing the expected internal branch lengths of gene trees under the MSC. This technique allows us to determine the regions of the parameter space of the species tree under which concatenated parsimony fails for different numbers of taxa, for rooted or unrooted trees. We use our new approach to demonstrate that there are always regions of statistical inconsistency for concatenated parsimony for the 5- and 6-taxa cases, regardless of rooting. Our results therefore suggest that parsimony is not generally dependable under the MSC.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load kinetics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics are not affected by mass vaccination policies in Italy. Our contribution is devoted to provide an effective computational pipeline to evaluate in real time the evolution of infectivity. Comprehending the factors influencing the in-host viral dynamics represents a fundamental tool to provide robust public health strategies. This pilot study could be implemented in further investigations involving other respiratory viruses, to better clarify the process of viral dynamics as a preparatory action for future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>
