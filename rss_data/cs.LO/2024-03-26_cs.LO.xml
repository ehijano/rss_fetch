      <title>Proceedings Sixth Workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of MARS 2024, the sixth workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems, held as part of ETAPS 2024, the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.
  The MARS workshops bring together researchers from different communities who are developing formal models of real systems in areas where complex models occur, such as networks, cyber-physical systems, hardware/software co-design, biology, etc. The motivation and aim for MARS stem from the following two observations:
  (1) Large case studies are essential to show that specification formalisms and modelling techniques are applicable to real systems, whereas many research papers only consider toy examples or tiny case studies.
  (2) Developing an accurate model of a real system takes a large amount of time, often months or years. In most scientific papers, however, salient details of the model need to be skipped due to lack of space, and to leave room for formal verification methodologies and results.
  The MARS workshops aim at remedying these issues, emphasising modelling over verification, so as to retain lessons learnt from formal modelling, which are not usually discussed elsewhere. </description>

      <title>Uniform Preorders and Partial Combinatory Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform preorders are a class of combinatory representations of Set-indexed preorders that generalize Pieter Hofstra's basic relational objects. An indexed preorder is representable by a uniform preorder if and only if it has as generic predicate. We study the $\exists$-completion of indexed preorders on the level of uniform preorders, and identify a combinatory condition (called 'relational completeness') which characterizes those uniform preorders with finite meets whose $\exists$-completions are triposes. The class of triposes obtained this way contains relative realizability triposes, for which we derive a characterization as a fibrational analogue of the characterization of realizability toposes given in earlier work.
  Besides relative partial combinatory algebras, the class of relationally complete uniform preorders contains filtered ordered partial combinatory algebras, and it is unclear if there are any others.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of the Empty Hexagon Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent breakthrough in computer-assisted mathematics showed that every set of $30$ points in the plane in general position (i.e., without three on a common line) contains an empty convex hexagon, thus closing a line of research dating back to the 1930s. Through a combination of geometric insights and automated reasoning techniques, Heule and Scheucher constructed a CNF formula $\phi_n$, with $O(n^4)$ clauses, whose unsatisfiability implies that no set of $n$ points in general position can avoid an empty convex hexagon. An unsatisfiability proof for n = 30 was then found with a SAT solver using 17300 CPU hours of parallel computation, thus implying that the empty hexagon number h(6) is equal to 30. In this paper, we formalize and verify this result in the Lean theorem prover. Our formalization covers discrete computational geometry ideas and SAT encoding techniques that have been successfully applied to similar Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres-type problems. In particular, our framework provides tools to connect standard mathematical objects to propositional assignments, which represents a key step towards the formal verification of other SAT-based mathematical results. Overall, we hope that this work sets a new standard for verification when extensive computation is used for discrete geometry problems, and that it increases the trust the mathematical community has in computer-assisted proofs in this area.</description>

      <title>Investigating Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems: Specification-Centric Analysis in the face of System Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is on the rise in complex physical environments, encompassing domains such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. A critical attribute of CPS is robustness, denoting its capacity to operate safely despite potential disruptions and uncertainties in the operating environment. This paper proposes a novel specification-based robustness, which characterizes the effectiveness of a controller in meeting a specified system requirement, articulated through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) while accounting for possible deviations in the system. This paper also proposes the robustness falsification problem based on the definition, which involves identifying minor deviations capable of violating the specified requirement. We present an innovative two-layer simulation-based analysis framework designed to identify subtle robustness violations. To assess our methodology, we devise a series of benchmark problems wherein system parameters can be adjusted to emulate various forms of uncertainties and disturbances. Initial evaluations indicate that our falsification approach proficiently identifies robustness violations, providing valuable insights for comparing robustness between conventional and reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers</description>
