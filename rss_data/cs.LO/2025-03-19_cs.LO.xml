      <title>The Verification Problem for the Subgame Perfect Equilibrium and the Nash Equilibrium in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in artificial intelligence due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating and computing which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the \emph{Nash equilibrium} and the \emph{subgame perfect equilibrium}, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since the subgame equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of the Nash equilibrium and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a suggestion of Birkhoff and Von Neumann [Ann. Math. 37 (1936), 23-32], we pursue a joint study of quantum logic and intuitionistic logic. We exhibit a linear-time translation which for each quantum logic $Q$ and each superintuitionistic logic $I$ yields an axiomatization of $Q\cap I$ from axiomatizations of $Q$ and $I$. The translation is centered around a certain axiom (Ex) which (together with introduction and elimination rules for connectives) is shown to axiomatize the intersection of orthologic and intuitionistic logic, solving a problem of Holliday [Logics 1 (2023), pp. 36-79]. We prove that the lattice of all super-Ex logics is isomorphic to the product of the lattices of quantum logics and superintuitionistic logics in the signature $\{\land,\lor,\neg\}$. We prove that there are infinitely many sub-Ex logics extending Holliday's fundamental logic.</description>

      <title>ChonkyBFT: Consensus Protocol of ZKsync</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ChonkyBFT, a partially-synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol used in the ZKsync system. The proposed protocol is a hybrid protocol inspired by FAB Paxos, Fast-HotStuff, and HotStuff-2. It is a committee-based protocol with only one round of voting, single slot finality, quadratic communication, and n &gt;= 5f + 1 fault tolerance. This design enables its effective application within the context of the ZKsync rollup, achieving its most critical goals: simplicity, low transaction latency, and reduced system complexity. The target audience for this paper is the ZKsync community and others worldwide who seek assurance in the safety and security of the ZKsync protocols. The described consensus protocol has been implemented, analyzed, and tested using formal methods.</description>

      <title>A biequivalence of path categories and axiomatic Martin-L\"of type theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semantics of extensional type theory has an elegant categorical description: models of Sigma-types and extensional Id-types are biequivalent to finitely complete categories. We establish a similar result for intensional type theories: weak models of Sigma-types and axiomatic Id-types are biequivalent to path categories. These axiomatic Id-types only satisfy beta-reduction rule as a propositional equality, and appear in cubical type theory, as well as axiomatic type theory (type theory without definitional equality). Path categories take inspiration from homotopy theory and simplify the structure of type theory using a primitive notion of equivalence. Our biequivalence allows us to turn path categories into actual models of type theory: we turn them into weak models, where substitution is only specified up to isomorphism, which we can in turn strictify using the left adjoint splitting. In addition, we introduce a more fine-grained notion: that of a display path category, and prove a similar biequivalence. These display path categories still model axiomatic Id-types, but not the intensional notion of Sigma-types. We show how they can be extended with axiomatic notions of Sigma-types and Pi-types, allowing us to model axiomatic type theory.</description>

      <title>Fractals from Regular Behaviours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forge connections between the theory of fractal sets obtained as attractors of iterated function systems and process calculi. To this end, we reinterpret Milner's expressions for processes as contraction operators on a complete metric space. When the space is, for example, the plane, the denotations of fixed point terms correspond to familiar fractal sets. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of fractal equivalence, the congruence on terms consisting of pairs that construct identical self-similar sets in all interpretations. We further make connections to labelled Markov chains and to invariant measures. In all of this work, we use important results from process calculi. For example, we use Rabinovich's completeness theorem for trace equivalence in our own completeness theorem. In addition to our results, we also raise many questions related to both fractals and process calculi.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>
