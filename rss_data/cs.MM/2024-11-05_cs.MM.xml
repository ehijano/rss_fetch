      <title>Personality Analysis from Online Short Video Platforms with Multi-domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality analysis from online short videos has gained prominence due to its applications in personalized recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. Traditional assessment methods, such as questionnaires based on the Big Five Personality Framework, are limited by self-report biases and are impractical for large-scale or real-time analysis. Leveraging the rich, multi-modal data present in short videos offers a promising alternative for more accurate personality inference. However, integrating these diverse and asynchronous modalities poses significant challenges, particularly in aligning time-varying data and ensuring models generalize well to new domains with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal personality analysis framework that addresses these challenges by synchronizing and integrating features from multiple modalities and enhancing model generalization through domain adaptation. We introduce a timestamp-based modality alignment mechanism that synchronizes data based on spoken word timestamps, ensuring accurate correspondence across modalities and facilitating effective feature integration. To capture temporal dependencies and inter-modal interactions, we employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most informative features for personality prediction. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-based domain adaptation method that transfers knowledge from multiple source domains to improve performance in target domains with scarce labeled data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in personality prediction tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing complex behavioral cues and robustness in adapting to new domains.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become crucial in multimodal recommendation tasks because of their powerful ability to capture complex relationships between neighboring nodes. However, increasing the number of propagation layers in GNNs can lead to feature redundancy, which may negatively impact the overall recommendation performance. In addition, the existing recommendation task method directly maps the preprocessed multimodal features to the low-dimensional space, which will bring the noise unrelated to user preference, thus affecting the representation ability of the model. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation (MGNM) with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy, which is divided into local and global interaction. Initially, in the local interaction process,we integrate a dynamic de-redundancy (DDR) loss function which is achieved by utilizing the product of the feature coefficient matrix and the feature matrix as a penalization factor. It reduces the feature redundancy effects of multimodal and behavioral features caused by the stacking of multiple GNN layers. Subsequently, in the global interaction process, we developed modality-guided global feature purifiers for each modality to alleviate the impact of modality noise. It is a two-fold guiding mechanism eliminating modality features that are irrelevant to user preferences and captures complex relationships within the modality. Experimental results demonstrate that MGNM achieves superior performance on multimodal information denoising and removal of redundant information compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Saliency-Based diversity and fairness Metric and FaceKeepOriginalAugment: A Novel Approach for Enhancing Fairness and Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation has become a pivotal tool in enhancing the performance of computer vision tasks, with the KeepOriginalAugment method emerging as a standout technique for its intelligent incorporation of salient regions within less prominent areas, enabling augmentation in both regions. Despite its success in image classification, its potential in addressing biases remains unexplored. In this study, we introduce an extension of the KeepOriginalAugment method, termed FaceKeepOriginalAugment, which explores various debiasing aspects-geographical, gender, and stereotypical biases-in computer vision models. By maintaining a delicate balance between data diversity and information preservation, our approach empowers models to exploit both diverse salient and non-salient regions, thereby fostering increased diversity and debiasing effects. We investigate multiple strategies for determining the placement of the salient region and swapping perspectives to decide which part undergoes augmentation. Leveraging the Image Similarity Score (ISS), we quantify dataset diversity across a range of datasets, including Flickr Faces HQ (FFHQ), WIKI, IMDB, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW), UTK Faces, and Diverse Dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of FaceKeepOriginalAugment in mitigating gender bias across CEO, Engineer, Nurse, and School Teacher datasets, utilizing the Image-Image Association Score (IIAS) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Our findings shows the efficacy of FaceKeepOriginalAugment in promoting fairness and inclusivity within computer vision models, demonstrated by reduced gender bias and enhanced overall fairness. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric, Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric, which quantifies both diversity and fairness while handling data imbalance across various datasets.</description>

      <title>MoMu-Diffusion: On Learning Long-Term Motion-Music Synchronization and Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion-to-music and music-to-motion have been studied separately, each attracting substantial research interest within their respective domains. The interaction between human motion and music is a reflection of advanced human intelligence, and establishing a unified relationship between them is particularly important. However, to date, there has been no work that considers them jointly to explore the modality alignment within. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, termed MoMu-Diffusion, for long-term and synchronous motion-music generation. Firstly, to mitigate the huge computational costs raised by long sequences, we propose a novel Bidirectional Contrastive Rhythmic Variational Auto-Encoder (BiCoR-VAE) that extracts the modality-aligned latent representations for both motion and music inputs. Subsequently, leveraging the aligned latent spaces, we introduce a multi-modal Transformer-based diffusion model and a cross-guidance sampling strategy to enable various generation tasks, including cross-modal, multi-modal, and variable-length generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMu-Diffusion surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can synthesize realistic, diverse, long-term, and beat-matched music or motion sequences. The generated samples and codes are available at https://momu-diffusion.github.io/</description>

      <title>3D Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

      <title>Diffusion-based Generative Multicasting with Intent-aware Semantic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

      <title>ReactFace: Online Multiple Appropriate Facial Reaction Generation in Dyadic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dyadic interaction, predicting the listener's facial reactions is challenging as different reactions could be appropriate in response to the same speaker's behaviour. Previous approaches predominantly treated this task as an interpolation or fitting problem, emphasizing deterministic outcomes but ignoring the diversity and uncertainty of human facial reactions. Furthermore, these methods often failed to model short-range and long-range dependencies within the interaction context, leading to issues in the synchrony and appropriateness of the generated facial reactions. To address these limitations, this paper reformulates the task as an extrapolation or prediction problem, and proposes an novel framework (called ReactFace) to generate multiple different but appropriate facial reactions from a speaker behaviour rather than merely replicating the corresponding listener facial behaviours. Our ReactFace generates multiple different but appropriate photo-realistic human facial reactions by: (i) learning an appropriate facial reaction distribution representing multiple different but appropriate facial reactions; and (ii) synchronizing the generated facial reactions with the speaker verbal and non-verbal behaviours at each time stamp, resulting in realistic 2D facial reaction sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating multiple diverse, synchronized, and appropriate facial reactions from each speaker's behaviour. The quality of the generated facial reactions is intimately tied to the speaker's speech and facial expressions, achieved through our novel speaker-listener interaction modules. Our code is made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/lingjivoo/ReactFace}.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models; however, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. The dataset and code will soon be released on https://github.com/ruohaoguo/avis.</description>

      <title>AnyV2V: A Tuning-Free Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamic field of digital content creation using generative models, state-of-the-art video editing models still do not offer the level of quality and control that users desire. Previous works on video editing either extended from image-based generative models in a zero-shot manner or necessitated extensive fine-tuning, which can hinder the production of fluid video edits. Furthermore, these methods frequently rely on textual input as the editing guidance, leading to ambiguities and limiting the types of edits they can perform. Recognizing these challenges, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel tuning-free paradigm designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model to generate the edited video through temporal feature injection. AnyV2V can leverage any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks, including prompt-based editing, reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. AnyV2V can also support any video length. Our evaluation shows that AnyV2V achieved CLIP-scores comparable to other baseline methods. Furthermore, AnyV2V significantly outperformed these baselines in human evaluations, demonstrating notable improvements in visual consistency with the source video while producing high-quality edits across all editing tasks.</description>

      <title>Emotion-LLaMA: Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning with Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate emotion perception is crucial for various applications, including human-computer interaction, education, and counseling. However, traditional single-modality approaches often fail to capture the complexity of real-world emotional expressions, which are inherently multimodal. Moreover, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in integrating audio and recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions. To address this, we introduce the MERR dataset, containing 28,618 coarse-grained and 4,487 fine-grained annotated samples across diverse emotional categories. This dataset enables models to learn from varied scenarios and generalize to real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose Emotion-LLaMA, a model that seamlessly integrates audio, visual, and textual inputs through emotion-specific encoders. By aligning features into a shared space and employing a modified LLaMA model with instruction tuning, Emotion-LLaMA significantly enhances both emotional recognition and reasoning capabilities. Extensive evaluations show Emotion-LLaMA outperforms other MLLMs, achieving top scores in Clue Overlap (7.83) and Label Overlap (6.25) on EMER, an F1 score of 0.9036 on MER2023-SEMI challenge, and the highest UAR (45.59) and WAR (59.37) in zero-shot evaluations on DFEW dataset.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Bench: Evaluating and Improving Compositional Text-to-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</description>

      <title>OneDiff: A Generalist Model for Image Difference Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Modality Fusion Approaches for Audio-Visual Person Identification and Verification</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning involves integrating information from various modalities to enhance learning and comprehension. We compare three modality fusion strategies in person identification and verification by processing two modalities: voice and face. In this paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed for x-vector extraction from voice, while the pre-trained VGGFace2 network and transfer learning are utilized for face modality. In addition, gammatonegram is used as speech representation in engagement with the Darknet19 pre-trained network. The proposed systems are evaluated using the K-fold cross-validation technique on the 118 speakers of the test set of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. The comparative evaluations are done for single-modality and three proposed multimodal strategies in equal situations. Results demonstrate that the feature fusion strategy of gammatonegram and facial features achieves the highest performance, with an accuracy of 98.37% in the person identification task. However, concatenating facial features with the x-vector reaches 0.62% for EER in verification tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Speech Emotion Recognition via Feature Distribution Adaptation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.</description>
