      <title>Controlled protein synthesis and spatial organisation in microfluidic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing cell-free expression (CFE) in tailored microfluidic environments is a powerful tool to investigate the organisation of biosystems from molecular to multicellular scales. While cell-free transcription-translation systems simplify and open up cellular biochemistry for manipulation, microfluidics enables miniaturisation and precise control over geometries and reaction conditions. In this review, we highlight the benefits of combining microfluidics with CFE reactions for the study and engineering of molecular functions and the construction of life-like systems from non-living components. By defining spatial organisation at different scales and sustaining non-equilibrium conditions, microfluidic environments play a key role in the quest to boot up the biochemistry of life.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Mental Workload Classification with a Multimodal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately assessing mental workload is crucial in cognitive neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and real-time monitoring, as cognitive load fluctuations affect performance and decision-making. While Electroencephalography (EEG) based machine learning (ML) models can be used to this end, their high computational cost hinders embedded real-time applications. Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This study compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones, using an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal integration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one, demonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load detection. These findings position event-based processing as a promising solution for low-latency, energy efficient workload monitoring in adaptive closed-loop embedded devices that dynamically regulate cognitive load.</description>

      <title>Conditional Latent Space Molecular Scaffold Optimization for Accelerated Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid discovery of new chemical compounds is essential for advancing global health and developing treatments. While generative models show promise in creating novel molecules, challenges remain in ensuring the real-world applicability of these molecules and finding such molecules efficiently. To address this challenge, we introduce Conditional Latent Space Molecular Scaffold Optimization (CLaSMO), which integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) to strategically modify molecules while preserving similarity to the original input, effectively framing the task as constrained optimization. Our LSBO setting improves the sample-efficiency of the molecular optimization, and our modification approach helps us to obtain molecules with higher chances of real-world applicability. CLaSMO explores substructures of molecules in a sample-efficient manner by performing BO in the latent space of a CVAE conditioned on the atomic environment of the molecule to be optimized. Our extensive evaluations across diverse optimization tasks, including rediscovery, docking score, and multi-property optimization, show that CLaSMO efficiently enhances target properties, delivers remarkable sample-efficiency crucial for resource-limited applications while considering molecular similarity constraints, achieves state of the art performance, and maintains practical synthetic accessibility. We also provide an open-source web application that enables chemical experts to apply CLaSMO in a Human-in-the-Loop setting.</description>
