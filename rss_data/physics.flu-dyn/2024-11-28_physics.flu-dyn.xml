      <title>Compressibility and volume variations due to composition in multicomponent fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For single components fluids, vanishing isothermal compressibility implies that the mass density is constant, but the same conclusion is unknown for multicomponent fluids. Here the volume remains affected by changes of the composition. In the present paper we discuss an apparently natural way to conceptualise, based on derivatives of the Gibbs function g, this 'volume change due to composition' as a compression. In this way the phenomenon becomes quantitatively comparable to the usual coefficients of compressibility. This is a first step to investigate the range of validity of the constant density approximation of multicomponent fluids. As an illustration, three different aqueous solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Flame-wall interaction of thermodiffusively unstable hydrogen/air flames -- Part II: Parametric variations of equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuel-lean hydrogen combustion systems hold significant potential for low pollutant emissions, but are also susceptible to intrinsic combustion instabilities. While most research on these instabilities has focused on flames without wall confinement, practical combustors are typically enclosed by walls that strongly influence the combustion dynamics. In part I of this work, the flame-wall interaction of intrinsically unstable hydrogen/air flames has been studied for a single operating condition through detailed numerical simulations in a two-dimensional head-on quenching configuration. This study extends the previous investigation to a wide range of gas turbine and engine-relevant operating conditions, including variations in equivalence ratio (0.4 - 1.0), unburnt gas temperature (298 K - 700 K), and pressure (1.01325 bar - 20 bar). These parametric variations allow for a detailed analysis and establish a baseline for modeling the effects of varying instability intensities on the quenching process, as the relative influence of thermodiffusive and hydrodynamic instabilities depends on the operating conditions. While the quenching characteristics remain largely unaffected by hydrodynamic instabilities, the presence of thermodiffusive instabilities significantly increases the mean wall-heat flux and reduces the mean quenching distance. Furthermore, the impact of thermodiffusive instabilities on the quenching process intensifies as their intensity increases, driven by an increase in pressures and a decrease in equivalence ratio and unburnt gas temperature.</description>

      <title>Drawing of Weakly Viscoelastic Fluid Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the drawing of an axisymmetric viscoelastic tube subject to inertial and surface tension effects. We adopt the Giesekus constitutive model and derive asymptotic long-wave equations for weakly viscoelastic effects. Intuitively, one might imagine that the elastic stresses should act to prevent hole closure during the drawing process. Surprisingly, our results show that the hole closure at the outlet is enhanced by elastic effects for most parameter values. However, the opposite is true if the tube has a very large hole size at the inlet of the device or if the axial stretching is very weak. We explain the physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon by examining how the second normal stress difference induced by elastic effects modifies the hole evolution process. We also determine how viscoelasticity affects the stability of the drawing process and show that elastic effects are always destabilizing for negligible inertia. This is in direct contrast to the case of a thread without a hole for which elastic effects are always stabilizing. On the other hand, our results show that if the inertia is non-zero, elastic effects can be either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic aeroacoustic instabilities in the crosstalk apertures of can-annular combustors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of aeroacoustic instabilities at the interface between neighbouring combustion chambers in modern heavy-duty gas turbines. A simplified laboratory-scale geometry of the gap separating the outlet of these chambers, just upstream of the turbine inlet in can-annular combustor architectures, is considered. It consists of two channels with anechoic and chocked conditions on the upstream and downstream sides respectively. Right before the choked-flow vanes which represent the turbine inlet, a small aperture leads to an aeroacoustic crosstalk between the channels. The dimensions and flow conditions are defined such that relevant Mach, Strouhal and Helmholtz numbers of gas turbines are reproduced. The alignment of the vanes with respect to the crosstalk aperture is varied. An intense whistling is observed for some conditions. The oscillation frequency depends on the aperture area and scales with the Strouhal number based on the aperture length. The upstream anechoic condition in each channel implies that no longitudinal acoustic mode participate to the mechanism of this whistling, which is in agreement with the Strouhal scaling of this intrinsic aeroacoustic instability. Compressible Large Eddy Simulations of the configuration have been performed and remarkably reproduce the whistling phenomenon. This work contributes to the understanding of aeroacoustic instabilities at the crosstalk apertures of can-annular combustors. It will help designing combustor-turbine interfaces to suppress them, which is important since the vibrations they induce may be as damaging as the ones from thermoacoustic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: Scale and redshift variation of velocity and density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06515v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the scale and redshift variation of density and velocity distributions in self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow by a halo-based non-projection approach. All particles are divided into halo and out-of-halo particles for redshift variation of distributions. Without projecting particle fields onto a structured grid, the scale variation is analyzed by identifying all particle pairs on different scales $r$. We demonstrate that: i) Delaunay tessellation can be used to reconstruct the density field. The density correlation, spectrum, and dispersion functions were obtained, modeled, and compared with the N-body simulation; ii) the velocity distributions are symmetric on both small and large scales and are non-symmetric with a negative skewness on intermediate scales due to the inverse energy cascade at a constant rate $\varepsilon_u$; iii) On small scales, the even order moments of pairwise velocity $\Delta u_L$ follow a two-thirds law $\propto{(-\varepsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$, while the odd order moments follow a linear scaling $\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n+1}\rangle=(2n+1)\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n}\rangle\langle\Delta u_L\rangle\propto{r}$; iv) The scale variation of the velocity distributions was studied for longitudinal velocities $u_L$ or $u_L^{'}$, pairwise velocity (velocity difference) $\Delta u_L$=$u_L^{'}$-$u_L$ and velocity sum $\Sigma u_L$=$u^{'}_L$+$u_L$. Fully developed velocity fields are never Gaussian on any scale, despite that they can initially be Gaussian; v) On small scales, $u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a $X$ distribution to maximize the system entropy; vi) On large scales, $\Delta u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a logistic or a $X$ distribution; vii) the redshift variation of the velocity distributions follows the evolution of the $X$ distribution involving a shape parameter $\alpha(z)$ decreasing with time.</description>
