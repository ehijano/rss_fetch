      <title>Parallel PLL on DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parallel variant of Pruned Landmark Labelling (PLL) that is optimised for the preprocessing of hub labels on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This method was developed during a seminar at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), focusing on time-expanded graphs that model public transport networks. The approach leverages the topological properties of DAGs to enable a novel parallel construction of hub labels.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameters for Steiner Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the \textsc{Steiner Orientation} problem, where we are given as input a mixed graph $G=(V,E,A)$ and a set of $k$ demand pairs $(s_i,t_i)$, $i\in[k]$. The goal is to orient the undirected edges of $G$ in a way that the resulting directed graph has a directed path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ for all $i\in[k]$. We adopt the point of view of structural parameterized complexity and investigate the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} for standard measures, such as treewidth. Our results indicate that \textsc{Steiner Orientation} is a surprisingly hard problem from this point of view. In particular, our main contributions are the following: (1) We show that \textsc{Steiner Orientation} is NP-complete on instances where the underlying graph has feedback vertex number 2, treewidth 2, pathwidth 3, and vertex integrity 6; (2) We present an XP algorithm parameterized by vertex cover number $\mathrm{vc}$ of complexity $n^{\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$. Furthermore, we show that this running time is essentially optimal by proving that a running time of $n^{o(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$ would refute the ETH; (3) We consider parameterizations by the number of undirected or directed edges ($|E|$ or $|A|$) and we observe that the trivial $2^{|E|}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm for the former parameter is optimal under the SETH. Complementing this, we show that the problem admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(|A|)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm. In addition to the above, we consider the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} parameterized by $\mathrm{tw}+k$ (FPT), distance to clique (FPT), and $\mathrm{vc}+k$ (FPT with a polynomial kernel).</description>

      <title>Online Edge Coloring: Sharp Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem guarantees that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ admits an edge coloring using $\Delta + 1$ colors. In online settings - where edges arrive one at a time and must be colored immediately - a simple greedy algorithm uses at most $2\Delta - 1$ colors. Over thirty years ago, Bar-Noy, Motwani, and Naor [IPL'92] proved that this guarantee is optimal among deterministic algorithms when $\Delta = O(\log n)$, and among randomized algorithms when $\Delta = O(\sqrt{\log n})$. While deterministic improvements seemed out of reach, they conjectured that for graphs with $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$, randomized algorithms can achieve $(1 + o(1))\Delta$ edge coloring. This conjecture was recently resolved in the affirmative: a $(1 + o(1))\Delta$-coloring is achievable online using randomization for all graphs with $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ [BSVW STOC'24].
  Our results go further, uncovering two findings not predicted by the original conjecture. First, we give a deterministic online algorithm achieving $(1 + o(1))\Delta$-colorings for all $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$. Second, we give a randomized algorithm achieving $(1 + o(1))\Delta$-colorings already when $\Delta = \omega(\sqrt{\log n})$. Our results establish sharp thresholds for when greedy can be surpassed, and near-optimal guarantees can be achieved - matching the impossibility results of [BNMN IPL'92], both deterministically and randomly.</description>

      <title>Towards Tight Bounds for Estimating Degree Distribution in Streaming and Query Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree distribution of a graph $G=(V,E)$, $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$ is one of the most fundamental objects of study in the analysis of graphs as it embodies relationship among entities. In particular, an important derived distribution from degree distribution is the complementary cumulative degree histogram (ccdh). The ccdh is a fundamental summary of graph structure, capturing, for each threshold $d$, the number of vertices with degree at least $d$. For approximating ccdh, we consider the $(\varepsilon_D,\varepsilon_R)$-BiCriteria Multiplicative Approximation, which allows for controlled multiplicative slack in both the domain and the range. The exact complexity of the problem was not known and had been posed as an open problem in WOLA 2019 [Sublinear.info, Problem 98].
  In this work, we first design an algorithm that can approximate ccdh if a suitable vertex sample and an edge sample can be obtained and thus, the algorithm is independent of any sublinear model. Next, we show that in the streaming and query models, these samples can be obtained efficiently. On the other end, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem in both query and streaming models, and (almost) settle the complexity of the problem across both the sublinear models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms on Transformer-based Embedding Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation, recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition. Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets, particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes. Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.</description>

      <title>Min cost flow on unit capacity networks and convex cost K-flow are as easy as the assignment problem with All-Min-Cuts algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.04012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore here surprising links between the time-cost-tradeoff problem and the minimum cost flow problem that lead to fast, strongly polynomial, algorithms for both problems. One of the main results is a new algorithm for the unit capacity min cost flow that matches the complexity of the fastest strongly polynomial algorithm known for the assignment problem.
  The time cost tradeoff (TCT) problem in project management is to expedite the durations of activities, subject to precedence constraints, in order to achieve a target project completion time at minimum expediting costs, or, to maximize the net benefit from a reward associated with project completion time reduction. Each activity is associated with integer normal duration, minimum duration, and expediting cost per unit reduction in duration. We devise here the {\em all-min-cuts} procedure, which for a given maximum flow, is capable of generating all minimum cuts (equivalent to minimum cost expediting) of equal value very efficiently. Equivalently, the procedure identifies all solutions that reside on the TCT curve between consecutive breakpoints in average $O(m+n \log n)$ time, where $m$ and $n$ are the numbers of arcs and nodes in the network.
  The all-min-cuts procedure implies faster algorithms for certain TCT problems and for certain min cost flow problem with a significantly different approach from the ones known.</description>

      <title>Online Rounding Schemes for $ k $-Rental Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two online resource allocation problems with reusability in an adversarial setting, namely kRental-Fixed and kRental-Variable. In both problems, a decision-maker manages $k$ identical reusable units and faces a sequence of rental requests over time. We develop theoretically grounded relax-and-round algorithms with provable competitive ratio guarantees for both settings. For kRental-Fixed, we present an optimal randomized algorithm that achieves the best possible competitive ratio. The algorithm first computes an optimal fractional allocation using a price-based approach, and then applies a novel lossless online rounding scheme to obtain an integral solution. For kRental-Variable, we first establish the impossibility of achieving lossless online rounding. We then introduce a limited-correlation rounding technique that treats each unit independently while introducing controlled dependencies across allocation decisions involving the same unit. Combined with a carefully-crafted price-based method for computing the fractional allocation, this approach yields an order-optimal competitive ratio for the variable-duration setting.</description>

      <title>Hedonic Seat Arrangement Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a variant of hedonic games, called \textsc{Seat Arrangement}. The model is defined by a bijection from agents with preferences for each other to vertices in a graph $G$. The utility of an agent depends on the neighbors assigned in the graph. More precisely, it is the sum over all neighbors of the preferences that the agent has towards the agent assigned to the neighbor. We first consider the price of stability and fairness for different classes of preferences. In particular, we show that there is an instance such that the price of fairness ({\sf PoF}) is unbounded in general. Moreover, we show an upper bound $\tilde{d}(G)$ and an almost tight lower bound $\tilde{d}(G)-1/4$ of {\sf PoF}, where $\tilde{d}(G)$ is the average degree of an input graph. Then we investigate the computational complexity of problems to find certain ``good'' seat arrangements, say \textsc{Utilitarian Arrangement}, \textsc{Egalitarian Arrangement}, \textsc{Stable Arrangement}, and \textsc{Envy-free Arrangement}. We give dichotomies of computational complexity of four \textsc{Seat Arrangement} problems from the perspective of the maximum order of connected components in an input graph. For the parameterized complexity, \textsc{Utilitarian Arrangement} can be solved in time $n^{O(\gamma)}$, while it cannot be solved in time $f(\gamma)n^{o(\gamma)}$ under ETH, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\gamma$ is the vertex cover number of an input graph. Moreover, we show that \textsc{Egalitarian Arrangement} and \textsc{Envy-free Arrangement} are weakly NP-hard even on graphs of bounded vertex cover number. Finally, we prove that determining whether a stable arrangement can be obtained from a given arrangement by $k$ swaps is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k+\gamma$, whereas it can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness of BDD and SVP Under Gap-(S)ETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show improved fine-grained hardness of two key lattice problems in the $\ell_p$ norm: Bounded Distance Decoding to within an $\alpha$ factor of the minimum distance ($\mathrm{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$) and the (decisional) $\gamma$-approximate Shortest Vector Problem ($\mathrm{SVP}_{p,\gamma}$), assuming variants of the Gap (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-(S)ETH). Specifically, we show:
  1. For all $p \in [1, \infty)$, there is no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ for any constant $\alpha &gt; \alpha_\mathsf{kn}$, where $\alpha_\mathsf{kn} = 2^{-c_\mathsf{kn}}$ and $c_\mathsf{kn}$ is the $\ell_2$ kissing-number constant, assuming $c_\mathsf{kn} &gt; 0$ and that non-uniform Gap-ETH holds.
  2. For all $p \in [1, \infty)$, there is no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ for any constant $\alpha &gt; \alpha^\ddagger_p$, where $\alpha^\ddagger_p$ is explicit and satisfies $\alpha^\ddagger_p = 1$ for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, $\alpha^\ddagger_p &lt; 1$ for all $p &gt; 2$, and $\alpha^\ddagger_p \to 1/2$ as $p \to \infty$, unless randomized Gap-ETH is false.
  3. For all $p \in [1, \infty) \setminus 2 \mathbb{Z}$ and all $C &gt; 1$, there is no $2^{n/C}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ for any constant $\alpha &gt; \alpha^\dagger_{p, C}$, where $\alpha^\dagger_{p, C}$ is explicit and satisfies $\alpha^\dagger_{p, C} \to 1$ as $C \to \infty$ for any fixed $p \in [1, \infty)$, assuming $c_\mathsf{kn} &gt; 0$ and that non-uniform Gap-SETH holds.
  4. For all $p &gt; p_0 \approx 2.1397$, $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$, and all $C &gt; C_p$, there is no $2^{n/C}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{SVP}_{p, \gamma}$ for some constant $\gamma &gt; 1$, where $C_p &gt; 1$ is explicit and satisfies $C_p \to 1$ as $p \to \infty$, unless randomized Gap-SETH is false.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation blocks.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>
