      <title>Towards RGB Combiner for AR/VR applications on AlOx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum oxide (AlOx) offers low optical loss and high transparency in the visible spectrum, making it a promising material for integrated photonics in display technologies such as augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) and glassless 3D displays. This paper explores the development of an RGB beam combiner on an aluminum oxide platform, leveraging Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM) and multimode interference (MMI) structures to manipulate light intensity and achieve precise color control. The combiner design incorporates wavelength-specific gratings to radiate red (635 nm), green (520 nm), and blue (452 nm) light into far field at an exact propogation angle. MZMs control the intensity of each wavelength, allowing dynamic color tuning by modulating the beam interference. This signal can serve as the basis for a pixel building block in display technologies, offering flexible color manipulation at the pixel level.</description>

      <title>Relayed-loop optical scan amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern sensing, processing, and fabrication technologies depend upon the sequential scanning of laser light. Due to inertial, thermal, and electrical limitations, the speed of a typical laser deflector is inversely related to its optical invariant and therefore the number of resolvable spots it can address. Passive optical systems have been developed that can effectively double the optical invariant and maximum throughput of a single deflector. We present a method for increasing the effective optical invariant beyond 2$\times$ by repeated relaying of the deflected beam onto the deflector in an optical loop created within a cavity. We use this Relayed-Loop Optically Amplified Deflection (ReLOAD) approach to accomplish 8$\times$ amplification of electro-optical (EO) deflection, a deflection technology with unparalleled speed, but limited optical invariant. Using ReLOAD, we demonstrate 10 kHz frame rate imaging, 1 MHz line scan rate, and $\mu$s step times across an addressable space well beyond the capabilities of typical electro-optical deflectors.</description>

      <title>Tunable photonic crystals explained via Mie theory and discrete dipole approximation: a different light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel hybrid method based on Mie theory and the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) was developed to study the microscopic parameters governing the optical response of tunable photonic crystals (PC). The method is based on a two-step process. An effective polarizability derived from Mie theory is determined by equating the extinction efficiency of an isolated nanoparticle (NP) to the extinction efficiency of an equivalent particle considering the dipolar limit. Then, this effective polarizability is used in the DDA framework to compute the optical response of an interacting particle array constituting the PC structure.
  As a particular example, the method was applied to a linear array of core-shell magnetite@silica NPs to study the dependence of extinction and absorption on system parameters such as core radius, shell thickness, total radius, interparticle separation, and size distribution. The results indicate that an increase in these parameters leads to a redshift of the extinction peak as well as an increase in its $FWHM$. Finally, the method is applied to fitting experimental results on reflection/transmission measurements of magnetite@silica NPs colloids subjected to different magnetic field strengths with very good agreement.
  The presented method reduces the computational cost and time for the NPs sizes considered, and can be applied to PCs responsive to different stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field and temperature, \textit{inter alia}.</description>

      <title>Stability and optical quality of liquid crystal films as high repetition rate plasma mirrors in staged laser-plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new "windmill" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Triggered Superfluorescent Scintillation in Quantum-Ordered Perovskite Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluorescence, a cooperative emission phenomenon arising from the coherent coupling of excited dipoles, has historically been observed under optical excitation in carefully engineered quantum systems. Here, we report the first observation of superfluorescence triggered by ionizing radiation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Using CsPbBr3 NC superlattices with long-range structural and electronic order, we demonstrate that secondary electrons generated by high-energy photons can induce efficient cooperative emission bursts characteristic of superfluorescence with unprecedented scintillation lifetime of ~40 ps, thereby introducing a new class of coherent scintillating metamaterials. Side-by-side optical and scintillation measurements reveal a direct analogy between ionizing and intense optical excitation, both leading to high excitonic densities that result in superfluorescent emission, even at mild, technologically accessible cryogenic temperatures. The discovery that incoherent, stochastic ionization cascades can seed coherent many-body optical responses with radiatively accelerated luminescence and large Stokes shifts establishes a pathway toward ultrafast, reabsorption-free, quantum-ordered nanotechnological scintillators, paving the way for the future development of radiation detectors based on quantum technologies for advanced radiation detection applications.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Optical Coherence Tomography Images from Wavelength-space Using Deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile. This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Magnon-photon coupling in the YIG-based disk and ring microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of Static Disorder and Dephasing on Quantum Transport in LH1-RC Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Light Skyrmion Pulses via High Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paraxial light skyrmions are topological configurations that map a spatial domain of the field onto the full Poincar\'e sphere of polarization states. While skyrmions have been explored in continuous-wave regimes, their realization in the ultrafast domain remains open. Here we demonstrate that attosecond skyrmion pulses can be generated via high-harmonic generation. Advanced simulations combining single-atom strong-field theory and macroscopic propagation reveal that an infrared linearly polarized vector beam with fractional orbital angular momentum produces extreme-ultraviolet harmonic fields with nearly identical skyrmion polarization distributions across a broad spectral range. Using 1.2 $\mu$m driving fields and experimentally realistic spectral filtering, the coherent superposition of consecutive harmonics centered at 70 eV yields $\sim500$ attosecond pulse trains. Our results opens opportunities to use structured attosecond light with topological polarization textures,in fields as ultrafast control, imaging and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Compact Passive Resonant Fiber Optic Gyroscope by Using Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel passive resonant fiber-optic gyroscope (RFOG) design that achieves two true quadrature points at $\pi/2 $ and $3\pi/2$, enabling angular rotation measurement with maximum sensitivity. The use of a broadband light source, as demonstrated in previous studies, eliminates the need for precise frequency locking, while the resonant enhancement allows high sensitivity with significantly shorter fiber lengths. Building on this approach, the present work integrates a Non-Reciprocal Polarization Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) into the broadband RFOG configuration, called NRPPS-RFOG, enabling truly passive operation without the need for active modulation-demodulation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the coupling ratio and NRPPS phase shift critically influence both sensitivity and linearity. An additional NRPPS section extends the measurable angular rotation range, addressing limitations arising from long fiber loops. The proposed design combines compactness, high performance, and low complexity, offering a practical path toward navigation grade RFOGs. These results highlight the potential of passive NRPPS-RFOGs for cost-effective, high-precision rotational sensing in demanding applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled Dipole Oscillation Enabled Scintillation Compensation in Turbulence-Impacted Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.</description>

Abstract: Studying plasma dynamics is crucial for understanding processes like inertial confinement fusion, material damage, and shockwave formation from intense laser or current interactions. While pump-probe methods are standard for capturing these dynamics, single-shot experiments using high-power, low-repetition-rate systems with custom targets are challenging. We present a novel imaging technique using a synchronized GHz-rate spectrally tagged probe laser to capture multiple time-resolved snapshots from a single pump event.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach to single-shot multiparameter estimation for the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function. From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity $I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000 simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on 12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is incorporated.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of coherent nodal and antinodal dynamics in underdoped Bi-2212</title>

Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($&lt;$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond heat-based logic, writing and reset in an antiferromagnetic magnetoresistive memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</description>

      <title>Braiding of dynamical eigenvalues of Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the spectra are restricted to be real. However, the dynamics of the underlying fields may allow complex eigenvalues and therefore create the possibility of braiding structures. Here we study the braiding of dynamical eigenvalues in quantum systems by considering Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains with multiple bands. The dynamics of the quantum fields in these systems are described by their dynamic matrices, which have complex eigenvalues. We show that there are symmetry constraints imposed on these dynamic eigenvalues. Despite these constraints, braiding is possible for frequencies within the effective gain and loss regions of the complex plane. We explicitly construct two- and three-strand braidings using the exceptional points found in the system and discuss possible implementations.</description>

Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-variant systems have recently garnered considerable attention due to their unique potentials in manipulating electromagnetic waves. Here, a novel class of topological spacetime crystals is introduced, with a traveling-wave modulation that mimics certain aspects of physical motion. Challenging intuition, our findings reveal that, even though such systems rely on a linear momentum bias, it is feasible to engineer an internal angular momentum and non-trivial topological phases by leveraging the symmetry of its structural elements. Furthermore, these platforms exhibit a gauge degree of freedom associated with the arbitrariness in the choice of the coordinate transformation that eliminates the time dependence of the system Hamiltonian. The topology of the system is intricately governed by a synthetic magnetic potential whose field lines can be controlled by manipulating material anisotropy. Remarkably, the proposed spacetime crystals host an unconventional class of scattering-immune edge states, whose oscillation frequency adapts continuously along the propagation path, shaped by the geometric attributes of the path itself.</description>

      <title>Transformation and amplification of light modulated by a traveling wave with a relatively low frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of electromagnetic waves in media modulated in both time and space, extensively studied decades ago, has recently attracted renewed attention. In this work, we address a central question of this research: can light at an initial frequency $\omega_{0}$ be amplified solely by pumping with a traveling wave of much lower frequency $\omega_{p} \ll \omega_{0}$? In general, the bandwidth of the modulation-induced optical frequency-comb spectrum increases substantially when the phase velocity of the traveling wave, $v_{p}$, approaches the phase velocity of light, $v_{0}$. However, in realistic photonic waveguides, the resulting amplification remains negligible due to the unfeasible modulation strengths and waveguide parameters required. In contrast, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator with a traveling wave of frequency $\omega_{p}$ and phase velocity $v_{p}$ much smaller than the frequency $\omega_{0}$ and phase velocity $v_{0}$ of light can produce strong amplification. This effect is accompanied by conversion into multiple comb lines within a relatively narrow frequency band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional optical materials are characterized by either a dissipative response, which results in polarization-independent absorption, or by a gain response that leads to wave amplification. In this work, we study a peculiar class of materials with chiral-gain properties, where gain selectively amplifies waves of one polarization handedness, while dissipation suppresses the opposite handedness. We uncover a novel phenomenon, gain-momentum locking, at the boundary of chiral-gain media, where surface plasmons are amplified or attenuated based on their direction of propagation. This effect, driven by the interplay between spin-momentum locking and polarization-sensitive non-Hermitian responses, enables precise control over unidirectional wave propagation. Our findings open the door to photonic devices with unprecedented capabilities, such as lossless unidirectional edge-wave propagation and the generation of light with intrinsic orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Manipulating terahertz phonon-polariton in the ultrastrong coupling regime with bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method for phase recovery from a single two-beam interferogram is presented. Conventional approaches, relying on trigonometric inversion followed by phase unfolding and unwrapping, are hindered by discontinuities typically addressed through intricate algorithms. Our method bypasses the unfolding and unwrapping, instead formulating a first-order differential equation directly relating the phase to the interferogram. Integration of this equation enables continuous retrieval of phase along any straight path. Representing a new class of analytical tools for single-interferogram phase retrieval, this approach is derived from first principles and accommodates both Newton-type and Fizeau-type interferograms. Its performance is demonstrated on multiple idealized synthetic interferograms of increasing complexity, validating against the known seed phase.</description>

      <title>Digit classification using photonic reservoir computing based on a silicon microring resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.</description>

      <title>Role of Coherence in Polarization Response of Hybrid Monolayer MoS$_2$-Gold Nanoparticle Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichacogenides show strong second-order nonlinearity and symmetry-driven selection rules from their three-fold lattice symmetry. This process resembles the valley-contrasting selection rules for photoluminescence in these materials. However, the underlying physical mechanisms fundamentally differ since second harmonic generation is a coherent process, whereas photoluminescence is incoherent, leading to distinct interactions with photonic nanoresonators. In this study, we investigate the far- field circular polarization properties of second harmonic generation from MoS$_2$ monolayers resonantly interacting with spherical gold nanoparticles. Our results indicate that the coherence of the second harmonic allows its polarization to be mostly preserved, unlike in an incoherent process, where the polarization is scrambled. These findings provide important insights for future applications in valleytronics and quantum nanooptics, where both coherent and incoherent processes can be probed in such hybrid systems without altering sample geometry or operational wavelength.</description>

      <title>Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</description>

      <title>Imaging cross-degree-of-freedom structures in biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement</title>

Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum technology. Although hyperentangled states inherently facilitate access to high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, their distinguishing feature lies in the cross-DoF structures beyond independent entanglement in each DoF, which can be leveraged to enable novel and robust information processing schemes. In particular, for a spatial-polarization hyperentangled state generated from spontaneous parametric downconversion, the resulting polarization entanglement is structured by the spatial distribution of all interacting optical fields. Characterizing such cross-DoF structures is a crucial step towards employing hyperentangled states for practical quantum applications. Here, by performing polarization state tomography on all spatially correlated photon pairs, we have, for the first time, resolved the full-field spatial-polarization structure in a 251-dimensional hyperentangled biphoton state. We observe an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303 \pm 0.0004$, characterized by biphoton polarization phases that exhibit radial and linear gradients induced by the transverse momenta of the down-converted photons and the pump beam, respectively. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological Phenomena in a Weyl Exceptional Ring with Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.</description>
