      <title>Enriched duality in double categories II: modules and comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we continue the investigation of certain enrichments of dual algebraic structures in monoidal double categories, that was initiated in [Vas19]. First, we re-visit monads and comonads in double categories and establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of the former in the latter, under general conditions. These include monoidal closedness and local presentability of the double category, notions that are proposed as tools required for our main results, but are of interest in their own right. The natural next step involves categories of the newly introduced modules for monads and comodules for comonads in double categories. After we study their main categorical properties, we establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of modules in comodules, as well as an enriched fibration structure that involves (co)modules over (co)monads in double categories. Applying this abstract double categorical framework to the setting of V-matrices produces an enrichment of the category of V-enriched modules (fibred over V-categories) in V-enriched comodules (opfibred over V-cocategories), which is the many-object generalization of the respective result for modules (over algebras) and comodules (over coalgebras) in monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories of rational double points in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic less than seven, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>

      <title>Recovering R-symbols from modular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a premodular category $\mathcal{C}$, we show that its $R$-symbol can be recovered from its $T$-matrice, fusion coefficients and some 2nd generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ is modular, its $R$-symbols for a certain gauge choice are completely determined by its modular data.</description>

      <title>Type $\textrm{II}$ quantum subgroups for quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_N$. $\textrm{II}$: Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the indecomposable module categories over $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$, the category of integrable level-$k$ respresentations of affine Kac-Moody $\mathfrak{sl}_N$. Our first main result classifies these module categories in the case of generic $k$, i.e. $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $N$. As $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ is a braided tensor category, there is a relative tensor product structure on its category of module categories. In the generic setting we obtain a formula for the relative tensor product rules between the indecomposable module categories. Our second main result classifies the indecomposable module categories over $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ for $N\leq 7$, with no restrictions on $k$. In this non-generic setting, exceptional module categories are obtained. This work relies heavily on previous results by the two authors. In previous literature, module category classification results were known only for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>Injectives obstruct Fourier-Mukai functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the inclusion of injectives into the canonical heart as a replacement for tilting objects in computations of the characteristic morphism. Then we apply this construction to proofs of non-liftability of candidate non-Fourier-Mukai functors, i.e.\ functors that do not admit an $\mathcal{A}_\infty$/$\mathrm{dg}$-lift. This approach allows explicit computation of the obstruction against an $\mathcal{A}_\infty$-lift. We in particular observe that this computation gives for smooth degree $d&gt;2$ hypersurfaces an abundance of non-Fourier-Mukai functors.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Graded Semisimple Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of groupoid graded semisimple rings. Our rings are neither unital nor one-sided artinian. Instead, they exhibit a strong version of having local units and being locally artinian, and we call them $\Gamma_0$-artinian. One of our main results is a groupoid graded version of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, where we characterize groupoid graded semisimple rings as direct sums of graded simple $\Gamma_0$-artinian rings and we exhibit the structure of this latter class of rings. In this direction, we also prove a groupoid graded version of Jacobson-Chevalley density theorem. We need to define and study properties of groupoid gradings on matrix rings (possibly of infinite size) over groupoid graded rings, and specially over groupoid graded division rings. Because of that, we study groupoid graded division rings and their graded modules. We consider a natural notion of freeness for groupoid graded modules that, when specialized to group graded rings, gives the usual one, and show that for a groupoid graded division ring all graded modules are free (in this sense). Contrary to the group graded case, there are groupoid graded rings for which all graded modules are free according to our definition, but they are not graded division rings. We exhibit an easy example of this kind of rings and characterize such class among groupoid graded semisimple rings. We also relate groupoid graded semisimple rings with the notion of semisimple category defined by B. Mitchell. For that, we show the link between functors from a preadditive category to abelian groups and graded modules over the groupoid graded ring associated to this category, generalizing a result of P. Gabriel. We characterize simple artinian categories and categories for which every functor from them to abelian groups is free in the sense of B. Mitchell.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories of locally presentable abelian DG-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of an abelian DG-category, introduced by the first-named author in arXiv:2110.08237, unites the notions of abelian categories and (curved) DG-modules in a common framework. In this paper we consider coderived and contraderived categories in the sense of Becker. Generalizing some constructions and results from the preceding papers by Becker arXiv:1205.4473 and by the present authors arXiv:2101.10797, we define the contraderived category of a locally presentable abelian DG-category $\mathbf B$ with enough projective objects and the coderived category of a Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$. We construct the related abelian model category structures and show that the resulting exotic derived categories are well-generated. Then we specialize to the case of a locally coherent Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$, and prove that its coderived category is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf A$, thus generalizing a result from the second-named author's preprint arXiv:1412.1615. In particular, the homotopy category of graded-injective left DG-modules over a DG-ring with a left coherent underlying graded ring is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of DG-modules with finitely presentable underlying graded modules. We also describe compact generators of the coderived categories of quasi-coherent matrix factorizations over coherent schemes.</description>

      <title>Unfurling Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.06311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of categorical actions of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ under the deformation of their spectra. We give conditions under which the general point of a family of categorical actions of $\mathfrak{g}$ carry an action of a larger Lie algebra $\mathfrak{\tilde{g}}$, which we call an {\bf unfurling} of $\mathfrak{g}$. This is closely related to the folding of Dynkin diagrams, but to avoid confusion, we think it is better to use a different term.
  Our motivation for studying this topic is the difficulty of proving that explicitly presented algebras and categories in the theory of higher representation theory have the "expected size." Deformation is a powerful technique for showing this because of the upper semicontinuity of dimension under deformation. In particular, we'll use this to show the non-degeneracy (in the sense of Khovanov-Lauda) of the 2-quantum group $\mathcal U$ for an arbitrary Cartan datum and any homogeneous choice of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue Prasma's homotopical group theory program by considering homotopy normal maps in arbitrary $\infty$-topoi. We show that maps of group objects equipped with normality data, in Prasma's sense, are algebras for a "normal closure" monad in a way which generalizes the standard loops-suspension monad. We generalize a result of Prasma by showing that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve normal maps or, equivalently, that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve the property of "being a fiber" for morphisms between connected objects. We also formulate Noether's Isomorphism Theorems in this setting, prove the first of them, and provide counterexamples to the other two. Accomplishing these goals requires us to spend substantial time synthesizing existing work of Lurie so that we may rigorously talk about group objects in $\infty$-topoi in the "usual way." One nice result of this labor is the formulation and proof of an Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem for group actions in $\infty$-topoi.</description>
