      <description>arXiv:2403.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of tetracycline (TC) and arsenite (As(III)) in livestock wastewater threatens public health, and the heterogeneous Fenton-like system is a practical approach for the simultaneous removal of TC and As(III). In this work, fine CoFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles are facilely anchored on heretically porous carbon (CoFe$_2$O$_4$@PC) via a microwave-assisted calcination method and used for eliminating TC and As(III) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Opto-Electro-Mechanical Measurements for Energy Loss Estimation in Thin-Film-Piezoelectric-on-Substrate MEMS/NEMS Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems have significant market potential owing to their superior capabilities of transduction to those of standard capacitive and piezoresistive devices. However, piezoelectric films are often lossy, which reduces the quality factor of devices and affects their performance. It is thus important to examine all sources of energy losses in such devices and accurately determine them based on experimental data. Currently used methods to quantify energy loss from different sources and the properties of materials based on experimental data are set-up for piezoelectric devices, in which energy storage and loss primarily occur in the same piezoelectric material. Moreover, such methods rely on resonance-antiresonance measurements, and thus are unsuitable for thin-film-piezoelectric-on substrate (TPoS) micro/nano devices that have i) a significant portion of energy stored in the substrate/device layer, ii) a low signal-to-noise ratio owing to either lossy piezoelectric films or low motional impedance, or iii) a larger feedthrough capacitance in addition to the internal capacitance of the piezoelectric film. In this paper, we propose a method that overcomes these challenges based on synchronized optical and electrical measurements. We develop a comprehensive physics-based model to extract all the relevant parameters for the device, including the coefficient of piezoelectric coupling, internal and feedthrough capacitance, loss tangents (dielectric, piezoelectric, and mechanical), and the contributions of different sources to the quality factor of the device. We showcase the proposed method by using a PZT-based TPoS MEMS cantilever. It can be universally applied to all piezoelectric materials and arbitrary stacks of the device layer.</description>

      <title>Modified Steinberg-Guinan elasticity model to describe softening-hardening dual anomaly in vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constitutive models are essential for describing the mechanical behavior of materials under high temperatures and pressures, among which the Steinberg-Guinan (SG) model is widely adopted. Recent work has discovered a peculiar dual anomaly of compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening in the elasticity of compressed vanadium [Phys. Rev. B 104, 134102 (2021)], which is beyond the capability of the SG model to describe. In this work, a modified SG constitutive model is proposed to embody such an anomalous behavior. Elemental vanadium is considered as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this improved model in describing the dual anomalies of mechanical elasticity. This new variant of the SG model can also be applied to other materials that present an irregular variation in the mechanical elasticity, and is important to faithfully model and simulate the mechanical response of materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Experimental Characterization for LS-DYNA MAT213 Modeling of Composite Structures under High Strain Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerospace structures often experience high strain rate events such as ballistic impact, crash, or crush. A material model has been developed that enhances the capability to simulate the dynamic response of composite materials under these loading conditions. The material model has been implemented into the commercially available transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA as MAT213. The model can simulate the nonlinear deformation, damage, and failure that takes place in a composite under dynamic loading conditions. The specific goal of this work is to characterize the MAT213 input for the representative material. The specific composite material being examined consists of T700G unidirectional carbon fibers and a low-melt PolyArylEtherKetone (LMPAEK) thermoplastic resin system. It is formally referred to as Toray TC1225 LMPAEK T700G. As the initial part of this work, this paper is focused on characterizing the material parameters for the MAT213 deformation model based on results obtained from multi-scale experimentation. The effort concentrated on characterizing the in-plane material response suitable for use with thin shell elements. For shell elements within MAT213, tabulated stress-strain results from tension and compression tests in the longitudinal and transverse directions and in-plane shear tests are required. Due to the difficulty of measuring small strains in the transverse direction, a multi-scale testing method was developed. Macro-scale testing is performed per the typical ASTM methods while micro-scale testing uses a microscope along with smaller coupon sizes to obtain the smaller strains in the transverse direction of each test. For both testing methods, a VIC-2D camera and software for digital image correlation analysis are used. Using the DIC combined with each test fixture, reliable stress and strain data are collected.</description>

      <title>Spin dissymmetry in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the spin dissymmetry factor, a measure of the spin-selectivity in the optical transition rate of quantum particles. This spin dissymmetry factor is valid locally, including at material interfaces and within optical cavities. We design and numerically demonstrate an optical cavity with three-fold rotational symmetry that maximizes spin dissymmetry, thereby minimizing the spin dephasing of a cavity-coupled quantum particle. Our approach emphasizes the difference between spin and chirality in the nearfield and reveals a classical parameter for designing more efficient quantum optical devices.</description>

      <title>Negative Capacitance for Stabilizing Logic State in Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the influence of negative capacitance on the transfer characteristics of vdW FETs on the heterophase of CIPS ferroelectric. Notably, a less pronounced NC resulting from the spatial distribution of the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases plays crucial role in stabilizing of n-channel-conductance. This results into the emergence of a non-volatile logic state, between the two binary states of TFETs. Concerned study proposed NC-TFETs based on ferroionic crystals as promising devices for generating a stable logic state below Vth.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven Langevin modeling of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Laser Phase Plate for Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low image contrast is a major limitation in transmission electron microscopy, since samples with low atomic number only weakly phase-modulate the illuminating electron beam, and beam-induced sample damage limits the usable electron dose. The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. 
  In this thesis, I present the theory, design, and implementation of the laser phase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase shift the electron beam. A near-concentric Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \, \mathrm{GW}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. 
  We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Scattering Zero Degeneracies for Spectral Management of Coherent Perfect Absorption in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA) protocol for cases where scale invariance is violated due to the presence of nonlinear mechanisms. We demonstrate, using a microwave setting that lacks geometrical symmetries, that the nonlinearity offers new reconfigurable modalities: the destruction or formation of nonlinear CPAs (NL-CPAs), and their frequency positioning and bandwidth management using the incident power as a control knob. The latter occurs via the formation of exceptional point degeneracies of the zeroes of nonlinear scattering processes. Our results establish NL-CPA protocols as a versatile scheme for the creation of reconfigurable hot/cold-spots in complicated enclosures (e.g. buildings or vessels) with applications to next-generation telecommunications, long-range wireless power transfer, and electromagnetic warfare.</description>

      <title>Sensing beyond the exceptional point for high detectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional point (EP)-based optical sensors exhibit exceptional sensitivity but poor detectivity due to their acute sensitivity to perturbations such as noise. When the optical budget is limited as in applications on mobile platforms, high detectivity might be equally important as high sensitivity. In such scenarios, off-EP sensing is advantageous where a slight loss in sensitivity can lead to a significant gain in detectivity. Here, we show that a passive parity-time symmetric plasmonic-photonic hybrid shows a peak in its detectivity off EP where the sensitivity is still very high-surpassing the sensitivities of equivalent fully-plasmonic and fully-photonic systems. We demonstrate the high detectivity of off-EP sensing of anti-mouse IgG protein using this plasmonic-photonic hybrid system. We report a sensitivity of 1.2 nm/nM while requiring a minimum optical budget of 1.3 nJ. Thus, non-Hermitian plasmonic-photonic hybrids could be the best class of nanophotonic sensors for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Carrier confinement and alloy disorder exacerbate Auger-Meitner recombination in AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum efficiency of AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) declines (droops) at increasing operating powers due to Auger-Meitner recombination (AMR). Using first-principles density-functional theory, we show that indirect AMR mediated by electron-phonon coupling and alloy disorder can induce bulk $C$ coefficients as large as $\sim10^{-31}$ cm$^6$/s. Furthermore, we find that the confinement of carriers by polarization fields within quantum wells severely relaxes crystal-momentum conservation, which exacerbates the rate of AMR over radiative recombination by an order of magnitude relative to the bulk. This results in a striking decrease in quantum efficiency at high power. Suppressing polarization fields and jointly increasing the well width would greatly mitigate AMR and efficiency droop.</description>

      <title>Multiplane Quantitative Phase Imaging Using a Wavelength-Multiplexed Diffractive Optical Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a label-free technique that provides optical path length information for transparent specimens, finding utility in biology, materials science, and engineering. Here, we present quantitative phase imaging of a 3D stack of phase-only objects using a wavelength-multiplexed diffractive optical processor. Utilizing multiple spatially engineered diffractive layers trained through deep learning, this diffractive processor can transform the phase distributions of multiple 2D objects at various axial positions into intensity patterns, each encoded at a unique wavelength channel. These wavelength-multiplexed patterns are projected onto a single field-of-view (FOV) at the output plane of the diffractive processor, enabling the capture of quantitative phase distributions of input objects located at different axial planes using an intensity-only image sensor. Based on numerical simulations, we show that our diffractive processor could simultaneously achieve all-optical quantitative phase imaging across several distinct axial planes at the input by scanning the illumination wavelength. A proof-of-concept experiment with a 3D-fabricated diffractive processor further validated our approach, showcasing successful imaging of two distinct phase objects at different axial positions by scanning the illumination wavelength in the terahertz spectrum. Diffractive network-based multiplane QPI designs can open up new avenues for compact on-chip phase imaging and sensing devices.</description>

Here, we realize high-performance graphene integrated photonics platform enabled by gold-assisted transfer. Thanks to our optimized transfer technique, we fabricate and demonstrate (1) a microscale thermo-optic modulator with a tuning efficiency of 0.037 nm/mW and high heating performance of 67.4 K${\mu}m^{3}mW^{-1}$ on a small active area of 7.54 ${\mu}m^{2}$ and (2) a graphene electro-absorption modulator featuring an high modulation bandwidth up to 26.8 GHz and a high-speed data rate reaching 48 Gb/s, and (3) a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer modulator with a high normalized modulation efficiency of 0.027 dBV$^{-1}{\mu}m^{-1}$. Our graphene integrated photonics platform has far superior performances compared to state of the art in terms of efficiency, low process complexity, and compact device footage. Thus, our approach and results provide the background for the realization of high-performance integrated photonic circuits with CMOS compatibility.</description>

      <title>Smart structural health monitoring (SHM) system for on-board localization of defects in pipes using torsional ultrasonic guided waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most reported research for monitoring health of pipelines using ultrasonic guided waves (GW) typically utilize bulky piezoelectric transducer rings and laboratory-grade ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment. Consequently, the translation of these approaches from laboratory settings to field-deployable systems for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) becomes challenging. In this work, we present an innovative algorithm for damage identification and localization in pipes, implemented on a compact FPGA-based smart GW-SHM system. The custom-designed board, featuring a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and front-end electronics, is capable of actuating the PZT thickness shear mode transducers, data acquisition and recording from PZT sensors and generating a damage index (DI) map for localizing the damage on the structure. The algorithm is a variation of the common source method adapted for cylindrical geometry. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated for detection and localization of defects such as notch and mass loading on a steel pipe, through extensive finite element (FE) method simulations. Experimental results obtained using a C-clamp for applying mass loading on the pipe show good agreement with the FE simulations. The localization error values for experimental data analyzed using C code on a processor implemented on the FPGA are consistent with algorithm results generated on a computer running MATLAB code. The system presented in this study is suitable for a wide range of GW-SHM applications, especially in cost-sensitive scenarios that benefit from on-node signal processing over cloud-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors through the Quantum Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient quantum sensing technologies rely on precise control of quantum sensors, particularly two-level systems or qubits, to optimize estimation processes. We here exploit the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) as a tool for maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors, with a specific focus on the level avoided crossing (LAC) phenomenon in qubit systems. While the estimation of the LAC energy splitting has been extensively studied, we emphasize the crucial role that the QZE can play in estimating the coupling strength. We introduce the concept of information amplification by the QZE for a LAC system under off-resonant conditions. The proposed approach has implications for AC magnetic field sensing and the caracterization of complex systems, including many-spin systems requiring the estimation of spin-spin couplings. Overall, our findings contribute to the advancement of quantum sensing by leveraging the QZE for improved control and information extraction.</description>

      <title>Performance of graphene Hall effect sensors: role of bias current, disorder and Fermi velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene Hall effect magnetic field sensors hold great promise for the development of ultra-sensitive magnetometers. Their performance is frequently analysed using the two-channel model where electron and hole conductivities are simply added. Unfortunately, this model is unable to capture all the features of the sensor, particularly the bias current dependence of the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we present an advanced model that provides an in-depth understanding of how graphene Hall sensors operate, and demonstrate its ability to quantitatively assess their performance. First, we report the fabrication of sensors with different qualities of graphene, with the best devices achieving magnetic field sensitivities as high as 5000 ohms/T, outperforming the best silicon and narrow-gap semiconductor-based sensors. Then, we examine their performance in detail using the proposed numerical model, which combines Boltzmann formalism, with distinct Fermi levels for electrons and holes, and a new method for the introduction of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles. Importantly, the dependences of magnetic field sensitivity on bias current, disorder, substrate and Hall bar geometry are quantitatively reproduced for the first time. In addition, the model emphasizes that the performance of devices with widths of the order of the charge carrier diffusion length, is significantly affected by the bias current due to the occurrence of large and non-symmetric carrier accumulation and depletion areas near the edges of the Hall bar. The formation of these areas induces a transverse diffusion particle flux capable of counterbalancing the particle flux induced by the Lorentz force when the Hall electric field cancels out in the ambipolar regime. Finally, we discuss how sensor performance can be enhanced by Fermi velocity engineering, paving the way for future ultra-sensitive graphene Hall effect sensors.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of light-matter strong coupling on chiral nonlinear optical effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter strong coupling (LMSC) is intriguing state in which light and matter are coherently hybridized inside cavity. It has been gaining widespread recognition as an excellent way for controlling material properties without any chemical modification. Here we show the LMSC is a powerful state to manipulate and improve a chiral nonlinear optical (NLO) effect through the investigation of second harmonic generation circular dichroism. At the upper polaritonic band in LMSC, in addition to an enhancement of SHG intensity by more than one order of magnitude, the responsivity to the handedness of circular polarized light is largely modified, where sign inversion and increase of dissymmetric factor is achieved. Quarter wave plate rotation analysis reveals that the LMSC clearly influence the coefficients associated with chirality in NLO process and it also contributes to the enhancement of nonlinear magnetic dipole interactions. This study demonstrates that LMSC serves as a novel platform for control of chiral optoelectronics and magneto-optics.</description>

      <title>In-situ observation of field-induced nano-protrusion growth on a carbon-coated tungsten nanotip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-protrusion (NP) on metal surface and its inevitable contamination layer under high electric field is often considered as the primary precursor that leads to vacuum breakdown, which plays an extremely detrimental effect for high energy physics equipment and many other devices. Yet, the NP growth has never been experimentally observed. Here, we conduct field emission (FE) measurements along with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging of an amorphous-carbon (a-C) coated tungsten nanotip at various nanoscale vacuum gap distances. We find that under certain conditions, the FE current-voltage (I-V) curves switch abruptly into an enhanced-current state, implying the growth of an NP. We then run field emission simulations, demonstrating that the temporary enhanced-current I-V is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that a NP has grown at the apex of the tip. This hypothesis is also confirmed by the repeatable in-situ observation of such a nano-protrusion and its continued growth during successive FE measurements in TEM. We tentatively attribute this phenomenon to field-induced biased diffusion of surface a-C atoms, after performing a finite element analysis that excludes the alternative possibility of field-induced plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electron Extraction in Co-Doped TiO2 Quantified by Drift-Diffusion Simulation for Stable CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar cells based on inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 are promising candidates to resolve the challenge of operational stability in the field of perovskite photovoltaics. For stable operation, however, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the extractive and recombinative processes occurring at the interfaces of perovskite and the charge-selective layers. In this study, we focus on the electronic properties of (doped) TiO2 as an electron-selective contact. We show via KPFM that co-doping of TiO2 with Nb(V) and Sn(IV) reduces the materials work function by 270 meV, giving it stronger n-type characteristics compared to Nb(V) mono-doped TiO2. The altered electronic alignment with CsPbI3 translates to enhanced electron extraction, as demonstrated with ssPL, trPL and trSPV in triad. Importantly, we extract crucial parameters, such as the concentration of extracted electrons and the interface hole recombination velocity, from the SPV transients via 2D drift-diffusion simulations. When implementing the co-doped TiO2 into full n-i-p solar cells, the operational stability is enhanced to 32000 h of projected TS80 lifetime. This study provides fundamental understanding of interfacial charge extraction and its correlation with operational stability of perovskite solar cells, which can be transferred to other charge-selective contacts.</description>

      <title>Microwave characterization of tantalum superconducting resonators on silicon substrate with niobium buffer layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tantalum thin films sputtered on unheated silicon substrates are characterized with microwaves at around 10 GHz in a 10 mK environment. We show that the phase of tantalum with a body-centered cubic lattice ($\alpha$-Ta) can be grown selectively by depositing a niobium buffer layer prior to a tantalum film. The physical properties of the films, such as superconducting transition temperature and crystallinity, change markedly with the addition of the buffer layer. Coplanar waveguide resonators based on the composite film exhibit significantly enhanced internal quality factors compared with a film without the buffer layer. The internal quality factor approaches $2\times 10^7$ at a large-photon-number limit. While the quality factor decreases at the single-photon level owing to two-level system (TLS) loss, we have identified the primary cause of TLS loss to be the amorphous silicon layer at the film-substrate interface, which originates from the substrate cleaning before the film deposition rather than the film itself. The temperature dependence of the internal quality factors shows a marked rise below 200 mK, suggesting the presence of TLS-TLS interactions. The present low-loss tantalum films can be deposited without substrate heating and thus have various potential applications in superconducting quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effect on Potential Barrier for Nucleosynthesis II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the potential barrier between two interacting nuclei. We addressed this by solving the Boltzmann equation and Maxwell's theory in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in the determination of magnetized permittivity. Additionally, we derived the magnetized Debye potential, which combines the conventional Debye potential with an additional magnetic component. We then compared the Boltzmann approach with the Debye method. Both methods consistently demonstrate that magnetic fields increase permittivity. This enhanced permittivity leads to a reduction in the potential barrier, consequently increasing the reaction rate for nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, the dependence on temperature and electron density in each approach is consistent. Our findings suggest that magnetized plasmas, which have existed since the Big Bang, have played a crucial role in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Pseudospin-Polarized Ultra-Wideband Waveguide Supporting Hybrid Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Cavity magnomechanics: from classical to quantum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.</description>
