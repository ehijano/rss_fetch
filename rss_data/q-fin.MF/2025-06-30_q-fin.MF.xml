      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>

      <title>Cross-Currency Basis Swaps Referencing Backward-Looking Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The financial industry has undergone a significant transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to Risk Free Rates (RFR) such as, e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the AUD Overnight Index Average (AONIA) in Australia, as the primary benchmark rate for borrowing costs. The paper examines the pricing and hedging method for SOFR-related financial products in a cross-currency context with the special emphasis on the Compound SOFR vs Average AONIA cross-currency basis swaps. While the SOFR and AONIA serve as a particular case of a cross-currency basis swap (CCBS), the approach developed is able to handle backward-looking term rates for any two currencies. We give explicit pricing and hedging results for collateralized cross-currency basis swaps using interest rate and currency futures contracts as hedging tools within an arbitrage-free multi-curve setting.</description>
