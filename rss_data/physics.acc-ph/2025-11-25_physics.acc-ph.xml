      <title>Upgrade to Fixed and Translating Scintillation-based Loss Detector System in the Fermilab Drift Tube Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closed-off structure of the Fermilab Drift Tube Linac precludes a robust array of instrumentation from directly monitoring the H- beam that is accelerated from 750 keV to 116 MeV. To improve beam tuning and operational assessment of Drift Tube Linac performance, scintillator-based loss monitors were previously installed along the exterior of the first two accelerating cavities to assess low energy beam losses. Here we present a recent upgrade to the loss monitor system, including significant improvements in analog signal processing to address baseline-interfering noise; digitization of the signals to enable regular operational use and tuning; and a new remote operation upgrade of the translating loss monitor with precise positioning of the loss monitor along its nine-foot track. Data from the fixed and translating detectors collected under varying beam conditions validate the utility of the upgrade.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic and Momentum Aperture Optimization for Lattice Design Using Multipoint Bayesian Algorithm Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution can overcome fundamental computational challenges in storage ring design optimization. Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design. We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>Space-Charge Effects During Half-Integer Resonance Crossing in the CERN PSB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The survival of charged particles in synchrotrons requires avoiding setting the beam on machine resonances, the most dangerous of which are the integer and half-integer. Nevertheless, operationally, the transverse tunes may change dynamically, crossing these resonances, and resulting in unwanted beam quality degradation and beam loss. For high intensity beams the process of resonance crossing is even more critical as space charge, in addition to the incoherent effects, may generate also coherent effects on the beam envelope dynamics. The interplay of the speed of resonance crossing, the space charge incoherent tune spread, and half-integer resonance width are fundamental for the beam behavior. In this paper we study the crossing of the half-integer resonance $2Q_y=9$ in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster~(PSB) for a range of parameters using a coasting beam. We take advantage of the newly commissioned PSB to investigate the beam response experimentally. The experimental findings are also discussed with the support of simulations.</description>

      <title>Strong Energy Dependent Transition Radiation in a Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation of a charged particle crossing an alternating stack of slabs in the optical region is considered. Both disordered and periodic stacks are investigated. It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene. We suggest this special type $1D$ photonic crystal for application as a detector of relativistic particles.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptive Neural Control of Resonant Extraction at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present progress on the development of a machine learning (ML) regulation system for third-order resonant extraction of the beam delivered to the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab. We consider classical and ML-based controllers optimized on semi-analytic simulations and provide performance comparisons for several models. Additionally, we discuss the efficiency of each model in training, which has implications for future work on adaptive control. We also discuss progress on developing optimized implementations of ML models for edge-based inference.</description>

      <title>Automated RF Phase Adjustment for Beam Stabilization in the Fermilab Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Linac experiences longitudinal beam phase drift, leading to increased particle loss, conventionally corrected through labor-intensive manual RF adjustments. This project explores machine learning-based automation for drift correction, employing a prototype-based classification approach. Our model utilizes a 34-dimensional feature set (RF settings and BPM readings) and leverages a 7x27 response matrix for system modeling. To overcome limited real-world data, we generate synthetic data, enhancing model training and generalizability. Custom loss functions, including a surrogate energy-consistent loss and a temporal smoothness constraint, ensure physically plausible drift predictions. The goal is a robust system for autonomous phase adjustments, ensuring stable beam acceleration and reduced manual intervention.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based Spill Regulation System for the Muon Delivery Ring at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon to Electron Experiment (Mu2e) requires a uniform beam profile from the Muon Delivery Ring to meet their experimental needs. A specialized Spill Regulation System (SRS) has been developed to help achieve consistent spill uniformity. The system is based on a custom-designed carrier board featuring an Arria 10 SoC, capable of executing real-time feedback control. The FPGA processes beam pulses of approximately 200 ns every 1.695 ${\mu}$s, allowing for continuous monitoring of the extracted spill intensity through fast bunch integration. The system directly controls three quadrupole magnets, which work in conjunction with sextupole magnets to achieve third-order resonant extraction. Furthermore, the board interfaces with Fermilab's Accelerator Control Network (ACNET), enabling operators to modify spill regulation settings in real-time via the control network while providing diagnostic waveforms. These waveforms help operators monitor the process and fine-tune the feedback mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of the board's architecture and its initial progress toward regulating beam extraction. This initial version of the regulation system aims to evaluate baseline performance to inform future system improvements.</description>
