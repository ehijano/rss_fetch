      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and topological band in a van der Waals Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of topological surface states and superconductivity within a single material platform is a crucial step toward achieving topologically nontrivial superconductivity. This can be achieved at an interface between a superconductor and a topological insulator, or within a single material that intrinsically hosts both superconductivity and topological surface states. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to study Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 crystals. Spectroscopic evidence reveals the coexistence of topological surface states and superconductivity on the same surface of the crystals. The Te-terminated surface exhibits a single U-shaped superconducting gap with a size of up to 311 {\mu}eV, alongside Dirac bands outside the gap. Analysis of the vortex structure and differential conductance suggests weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. The absence of observed zero modes suggests that shifting the Fermi level closer to the Dirac point of the topological bands is necessary to realize a topological superconducting state.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlation of radiation-induced errors in superconducting devices decays over a millimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform nanosecond-resolution multiplexed readout on six same-chip superconducting microwave resonators. This allows us to pinpoint the impact positions of ionizing radiation on the chip by measuring the differential time of flight of the generated phonons, inducing correlated errors in the device, thereby implementing an on-chip seismic array. We correlate the phase response of each resonator - a proxy for the absorbed energy - to the distance from the impact point to uncover a millimetric decay length for the phonon-mediated radiation poisoning.</description>

      <title>Superconducting susceptibility signal captured in a record wide pressure range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the resistance signature of the high temperature superconductivity above 250 K in highly compressed hydrides (more than 100 GPa) has garnered significant attention within the condensed matter physics community. This has sparked renewed optimism for achieving superconductivity under room-temperature conditions. However, the superconducting diamagnetism, another crucial property for confirming the superconductivity, has yet to be conclusively observed. The primary challenge arises from the weak diamagnetic signals detected from the small samples compressed in diamond anvil cells. Therefore, the reported results of superconducting diamagnetism in hydrides have sparked intense debate, highlighting the urgent need for workable methodology to assess the validity of the experimental results. Here, we are the first to report the ultrahigh pressure measurements of the superconducting diamagnetism on Nb0.44Ti0.56, a commercial superconducting alloy, in a record-wide pressure range from 5 GPa to 160 GPa. We present detailed results on factors such as sample size, the diamagnetic signal intensity, the signal-to-noise ratio and the superconducting transition temperature across various pressures and different pressure transmitting media. These comprehensive results clearly demonstrate that this alloy is an ideal reference sample for evaluating superconductivity in compressed hydrides,validating the credibility of the experimental systems and superconducting diamagnetic results, as well as determining the nature of the superconductivity of the investigated sample. In addition, these results also provide a valuable benchmark for studying the pressure-induced superconductivity in other material families.</description>

      <title>Exploring unconventional superconductivity in PdTe via Point Contact Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium Telluride (PdTe), a non-layered intermetallic crystalline compound, has captured attention for its unique superconducting properties and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate the superconducting state of PdTe using point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy. The experimental data are analyzed using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model for s, p and d wave symmetries. Our results reveal clear evidence of unconventional superconductivity. The superconducting gap showing features consistent with either p-wave or d-wave pairing symmetries but cannot be fitted with s-wave symmetry. The observed anisotropic gap structure and deviations from conventional BCS behaviour highlight the complex nature of the pairing interactions in PdTe. These findings provide strong evidence of unconventional pairing symmetry in this material.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on Honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In particular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which, under classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs -- four singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are symmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking of the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from the structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual non-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing (for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple pairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC order-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases (Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally occurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides (MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of polarized electronic Raman response in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, uncovering a systematic reduction of the incoherent electron continuum across the density wave transition in the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ representations. Analysis based on the Fermi surface band curvatures points to quasiparticle coherence in momentum positions with dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character. Our findings establish the symmetry channels and the active role of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals involved in the density wave formation, offering important insight into the electronic and magnetic correlations in the nickelate.</description>

      <title>Engineering second order topological superconductor hosting tunable Majorana corner modes in magnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrid platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for realizing a two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) in a hybrid system comprised of a $d$-wave superconductor, a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), and a noncollinear magnetic texture deposited on top of the unconventional superconductor. While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.</description>

      <title>Something about the Mechanism of Induction: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Josephson current signature of Floquet Majorana and topological accidental zero modes in altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.</description>

      <title>Magnetic signatures of pressure-induced multicomponent superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagram of the heavy fermion compound UTe$_2$ contains multiple superconducting phases, several of which show characteristics of odd-parity pairing. We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Probing Sign-Changing Order Parameters via Impurity States in unconventional superconductors: Implications for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Superconductors with interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the desire to investigate the fundamental relationship between impurity-induced states and the sign change of the superconducting order parameter, as well as to explore the impurity effects in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors with interlayer pairing, we employ the $T$-matrix approach to study single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors. Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</description>

      <title>Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity are thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. We estimate the resulting magnetic fields to be as large as $0.01-0.5$ mT, with a magnetic moment approaching $\mu_B/2$ per Cooper pair (Bohr magneton $\mu_B$). The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. In geometries strongly suppressing only one of the $d$-wave components, we find an additional heat capacity jump, as large as $10\%$ of the bulk normal-superconducting transition, marking the transition between a chiral and a nodal $d$-wave state. This further acts as an indirect signature of chiral superconductivity. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution.The findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>
