      <title>A FinTech Clustering Framework: Technology, Model, and Stakeholder Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the global booming of FinTech can be seen everywhere. FinTech has created innovative disruptions to traditional, long-established financial institutions (e.g., banks and insurance companies) in financial services markets. Despite of its popularity, there are many different definitions of FinTech. This problem occurs because many existing studies only focus on a particular aspect of FinTech without a comprehensive and in-depth analysis. This problem will hinder further development and industrial application of FinTech. In view of this problem, we perform a narrative review involving over 100 relevant studies or reports, with a view to developing a FinTech clustering framework for providing a more comprehensive and holistic view of FinTech. Furthermore, we use an Indian FinTech firm to illustrate how to apply our clustering framework for analysis.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of ChatGPT Research in Accounting and Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a review of recent publications and working papers on ChatGPT and related Large Language Models (LLMs) in accounting and finance. The aim is to understand the current state of research in these two areas and identify potential research opportunities for future inquiry. We identify three common themes from these earlier studies. The first theme focuses on applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in various fields of accounting and finance. The second theme utilizes ChatGPT and LLMs as a new research tool by leveraging their capabilities such as classification, summarization, and text generation. The third theme investigates implications of LLM adoption for accounting and finance professionals, as well as for various organizations and sectors. While these earlier studies provide valuable insights, they leave many important questions unanswered or partially addressed. We propose venues for further exploration and provide technical guidance for researchers seeking to employ ChatGPT and related LLMs as a tool for their research.</description>
