      <title>Counting Small Induced Subgraphs: Scorpions Are Easy but Not Trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parameterized problem $\#$IndSub$(\Phi)$ for fixed graph properties $\Phi$: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, this problem asks to count the number of induced $k$-vertex subgraphs satisfying $\Phi$. D\"orfler et al. [Algorithmica 2022] and Roth et al. [SICOMP 2024] conjectured that $\#$IndSub$(\Phi)$ is $\#$W[1]-hard for all non-meager properties $\Phi$, i.e., properties that are nontrivial for infinitely many $k$. This conjecture has been confirmed for several restricted types of properties, including all hereditary properties [STOC 2022] and all edge-monotone properties [STOC 2024].
  In this work, we refute this conjecture by showing that scorpion graphs, certain $k$-vertex graphs which were introduced more than 50 years ago in the context of the evasiveness conjecture, can be counted in time $O(n^4)$ for all $k$. A simple variant of this construction results in graph properties that achieve arbitrary intermediate complexity assuming ETH.
  We formulate an updated conjecture on the complexity of $\#$IndSub$(\Phi)$ that correctly captures the complexity status of scorpions and related constructions.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an integer $d\geq 1$, the $d$-Cut problem is that of deciding whether a graph has an edge cut in which each vertex is adjacent to at most $d$ vertices on the opposite side of the cut. The $1$-Cut problem is the well-known Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been extensively studied for $H$-free graphs. We extend these results to the probe graph model, where we do not know all the edges of the input graph. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes such that we can change $G$ into an $H$-free graph by adding zero or more edges between vertices in $N$. For every graph $H$ and every integer $d\geq 1$, we completely determine the complexity of $d$-Cut on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Faster Convolutions: Yates and Strassen Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two vectors $u,v \in \mathbb{Q}^D$ over a finite domain $D$ and a function $f : D\times D\to D$, the convolution problem asks to compute the vector $w \in \mathbb{Q}^D$ whose entries are defined by $w(d) = \sum_{\substack{x,y \in D \\ f(x,y)=d}} u(x)v(y).$ In parameterized and exponential-time algorithms, convolutions on product domains are particularly prominent: Here, a finite domain $B$ and a function $h : B \times B \to B$ are fixed, and convolution is done over the product domain $D = B^k$, using the function $h^k :D \times D\to D$ that applies $h$ coordinate-wise to its input tuples.
  We present a new perspective on product-domain convolutions through multilinear algebra. This viewpoint streamlines the presentation and analysis of existing algorithms, such as those by van Rooij et al. (ESA 2009). Moreover, using established results from the theory of fast matrix multiplication, we derive improved $O^\ast(|B|^{2\omega/3 \cdot k}) = O(|D|^{1.582})$ time algorithms, improving upon previous upper bounds by Esmer et al. (Algorithmica 86(1), 2024) of the form $c^k |B|^{2k}$ for $c &lt; 1$. Using the setup described in this note, Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture from algebraic complexity theory would imply quasi-linear $|D|^{1+o(1)}$ time algorithms. This conjecture has recently gained attention in the algorithms community. (Bj\"orklund-Kaski and Pratt, STOC 2024, Bj\"orklund et al., SODA 2025)
  Our paper is intended as a self-contained exposition for an algorithms audience, and it includes all essential mathematical prerequisites with explicit coordinate-based notation. In particular, we assume no knowledge in abstract algebra.</description>

      <title>Geometric complexity theory for product-plus-power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to Kumar's recent surprising result (ToCT'20), a small border Waring rank implies that the polynomial can be approximated as a sum of a constant and a small product of linear polynomials. We prove the converse of Kumar's result and establish a tight connection between border Waring rank and the model of computation in Kumar's result. In this way, we obtain a new formulation of border Waring rank, up to a factor of the degree. We connect this new formulation to the orbit closure problem of the product-plus-power polynomial. We study this orbit closure from two directions: 1. We deborder this orbit closure and some related orbit closures, i.e., prove all points in the orbit closure have small non-border algebraic branching programs. 2. We fully implement the geometric complexity theory approach against the power sum by generalizing the ideas of Ikenmeyer-Kandasamy (STOC'20) to this new orbit closure. In this way, we obtain new multiplicity obstructions that are constructed from just the symmetries of the polynomials.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom unitaries are neither real nor sparse nor noise-robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) possess the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appearing completely random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study, we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Further, we show an exponential advantage in imaginarity testing when having access to the complex conjugate of the state. Lastly, we show that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Spanning Trees Minimizing Branching Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Branch Vertices Spanning Tree problem aims to find a spanning tree $T$ in a given graph $G$ with the fewest branch vertices, defined as vertices with a degree three or more in $T$. This problem, known to be NP-hard, has attracted significant attention due to its importance in network design and optimization. Extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of this problem, with recent studies delving into its fixed-parameter tractability.
  In this paper, we focus primarily on the parameter modular-width. We demonstrate that finding a spanning tree with the minimum number of branch vertices is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) when considered with respect to modular-width. Additionally, in cases where each vertex in the input graph has an associated cost for serving as a branch vertex, we prove that the problem of finding a spanning tree with the minimum branch cost (i.e., minimizing the sum of the costs of branch vertices) is FPT with respect to neighborhood diversity.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state preparation for commuting Hamiltonian: Mapping to classical Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbs state preparation, or Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature.
  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.
  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in $\mathcal O(n^2)$ time.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then $H^{(c)}$ is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two models of space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems, ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. The ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ model, a space-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\sf QIP}$) introduced by Watrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier actions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically many pinching intermediate measurements per verifier action, making it the weakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS 1995).
  We characterize the computational power of ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L} \subsetneq {\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\sf P} = {\sf NP}$:
  - ${\sf QIPL}^{\rm HC}$, a subclass of ${\sf QIPL}$ defined by a high-concentration condition on yes instances, exactly characterizes ${\sf NP}$.
  - ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\sf P}$ and contains ${\sf SAC}^1 \cup {\sf BQL}$, where ${\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical logarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits.
  However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant. Our results further indicate that (pinching) intermediate measurements uniquely impact space-bounded quantum interactive proofs, unlike in space-bounded quantum computation, where ${\sf BQL}={\sf BQ_{\rm U}L}$.
  We also introduce space-bounded unitary quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L}$), a specific form of ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ proof systems with statistical zero-knowledge against any verifier. This class is a space-bounded variant of quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK}$) defined by Watrous (SICOMP 2009). We prove that ${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L} = {\sf BQL}$, implying that the statistical zero-knowledge property negates the computational advantage typically gained from the interaction.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D &gt; d$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>
