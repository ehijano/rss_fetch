      <title>A universal bioluminescence tomography system for pre-clinical image-guided radiotherapy research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CBCT-guided small animal irradiators encounter challenges in localizing soft-tissue targets due to low imaging contrast. Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) offers a promising solution, but they have largely remained in laboratorial development, limiting accessibility for researchers. In this work, we develop a universal, commercial-graded BLT-guided system (MuriGlo) designed to seamlessly integrate with commercial irradiators and empower researchers for translational studies. We demonstrate its capabilities in supporting in vitro and in vivo studies. The MuriGlo comprises detachable mouse bed, thermostatic control, mirrors, filters, and CCD, enabling multi-projection and multi-spectral imaging. We evaluate that the thermostatic control effectively sustains animal temperature at 37{\deg}C throughout imaging, and quantify that the system can detect as few as 61 GL261-AkaLuc cells in vitro. To illustrate how the MuriGlo can be utilized for in vivo image-guided research, we present 3 strategies, BLT-guided 5-arc, 2-field box, and BLI-guided single-beam, ranging from complicated high-conformal to simplest high-throughput plans. The high conformal BLT-guided 5-arc plan fully covers the gross tumor volume (GTV) at prescribed dose with minimal normal tissue exposure (3.9%), while the simplified, high-throughput BLT-guided 2-field box achieves 100% GTV coverage but results in higher normal tissue exposure (13.1%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization accuracy of MuriGlo for both widely-used SARRP and SmART irradiators is within1 mm, and the tumor coverage reaches over 97% with 0.75mm margin. The universal BLT-guided system offers seamless integration with commercial irradiators, achieving comparable localization accuracy, expected to supporting high-precision radiation research.</description>

      <title>Acoustically Transparent Alumina-based Cranial Implants Enhance Ultrasound Transmission Through a Combined Mechano-Acoustic Resonant Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapeutic ultrasound for brain stimulation has increased in the last years. This energy has shown promising results for treating Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and traumatic brain injury, among other conditions. However, the application of ultrasound in the brain should trespass a natural but highly attenuating and distorting barrier, the cranium. Implantable ceramic materials can be used to replace part of the cranium as an alternate method to enhance ultrasound transmission. In this work, it is presented the acoustic characterization of alumina ceramic disks that can be employed as cranial implants for acoustic windows-to-the-brain. Alumina samples were prepared using current-activated pressure-assisted densification and were acoustically characterized. Acoustic impedance and attenuation of the samples were determined for different porosities. Additionally, measured and modeled acoustic fields are presented and analyzed in terms of the total ultrasound transmitted through the ceramics. Results indicate a resonant behavior in the alumina disks when the thickness corresponds to a half-wavelength of ultrasound; this resonance permits a total of 95.4% of ultrasound transmission; for thicknesses out of the resonant zone, transmission is 53.0%. Alumina proves to be an excellent medium for ultrasound transmission that, in conjunction with its mechanical and optical properties, can be useful for cranium replacement in mixed opto-acoustic applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Tensor Tomography: An Outlook into Future Applications in Life Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Angle-X-ray Scattering Tensor Tomography (SAS-TT) is a relatively new, but powerful technique for studying the multiscale architecture of hierarchical structures, which is of particular interest for life science applications. Currently, the technique is very demanding on synchrotron beamtime, which limits its applications, especially for cases requiring a statistically relevant amount of sample. This study reports the first SAS-TT measurement at a macromolecular X-ray crystallography beamline, PX-I at the SLS, with an improvement in data acquisition time from 96 h/Mvoxel in the pilot experiments to 6 h/Mvoxel, defining a new standard for fast SAS-TT and allowing the measurement of a full tomogram in 1.2 hours. Measurements were performed on the long and lenticular process of the incus bone, one of the three human auditory ossicles. The main orientation and degree of alignment of the mineralised collagen fibrils are characterised, as well as the size and shape of the mineral particles which show relevant variations in different tissue locations. The study reveals three distinct regions of high fibril alignment, most likely important pathways of sound throughout the ossicular chain, and highlights the potential of the technique to aid in future developments in middle ear reconstructive surgery.</description>

      <title>The association of domain-specific physical activity and sedentary activity with stroke: A prospective cohort study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background The incidence of stroke places a heavy burden on both society and individuals. Activity is closely related to cardiovascular health. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the varying domains of PA, like occupation-related Physical Activity (OPA), transportation-related Physical Activity (TPA), leisure-time Physical Activity (LTPA), and Sedentary Activity (SA) with stroke. Methods Our analysis included 30,400 participants aged 20+ years from 2007 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Stroke was identified based on the participant's self-reported diagnoses from previous medical consultations, and PA and SA were self-reported. Multivariable logistic and restricted cubic spline models were used to assess the associations. Results Participants achieving PA guidelines (performing PA more than 150 min/week) were 35.7% less likely to have a stroke based on both the total PA (odds ratio [OR] 0.643, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.523-0.790) and LTPA (OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.514-0.805), while OPA or TPA did not demonstrate lower stroke risk. Furthermore, participants with less than 7.5 h/day SA levels were 21.6% (OR 0.784, 95% CI 0.665-0.925) less likely to have a stroke. The intensities of total PA and LTPA exhibited nonlinear U-shaped associations with stroke risk. In contrast, those of OPA and TPA showed negative linear associations, while SA intensities were positively linearly correlated with stroke risk. Conclusions LTPA, but not OPA or TPA, was associated with a lower risk of stroke at any amount, suggesting that significant cardiovascular health would benefit from increased PA. Additionally, the positive association between SA and stroke indicated that prolonged sitting was detrimental to cardiovascular health. Overall, increased PA within a reasonable range reduces the risk of stroke, while increased SA elevates it.</description>

      <title>Zero field active shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient field suppression is critical for accurate magnetic field measurements, and a requirement for certain low-field sensors to operate. The difference in magnitude between noise and signal (up to 10$^9$) makes the problem challenging, and solutions such as passive shielding, post-hoc processing, and most active shielding designs do not address it completely. Zero field active shielding (ZFS) achieves accurate field suppression with a feed-forward structure in which correction coils are fed by reference sensors via a matrix found using data-driven methods. Requirements are a sufficient number of correction coils and reference sensors to span the ambient field at the sensors, and to zero out the coil-to-reference sensor coupling. The solution assumes instantaneous propagation and mixing, but it can be extended to handle convolutional effects. Precise calculations based on sensor and coil geometries are not necessary, other than to improve efficiency and usability. The solution is simulated here but not implemented in hardware.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Total-body PET (TB-PET) scanners, with axial lengths exceeding 1 meter, provide significantly higher sensitivity than conventional PET scanners due to their greater acceptance of gamma pairs. However, this increased sensitivity often comes from gamma rays detected at oblique angles, leading to substantial multiple scattering along the patient's body. Additionally, the cost of TB-PET scanners scales with their extended detector length, often costing 5 to 10 times more than conventional scanners. Therefore, optimizing TB-PET performance requires crystals that enhance energy resolution and control costs.
  Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length.
  In our study, cryogenic CsI crystals achieved an energy resolution better than 7% FWHM at 511 keV and a coincidence time resolution of less than 2 ns. These results demonstrate the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TB-PET scanners.</description>

      <title>Low-rank based motion correction followed by automatic frame selection in DT-CMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Post-processing of in-vivo diffusion tensor CMR (DT-CMR) is challenging due to the low SNR and variation in contrast between frames which makes image registration difficult, and the need to manually reject frames corrupted by motion. Goals: To develop a semi-automatic post-processing pipeline for robust DT-CMR registration and automatic frame selection. Approach: We used low intrinsic rank averaged frames as the reference to register other low-ranked frames. A myocardium-guided frame selection rejected the frames with signal loss, through-plane motion and poor registration. Results: The proposed method outperformed our previous noise-robust rigid registration on helix angle data quality and reduced negative eigenvalues in healthy volunteers.</description>

      <title>Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction with a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) with positron emission tomography (PET) offers many potential clinical applications but typically requires expensive hardware upgrades or increases radiation doses on PET/CT scanners due to an extra X-ray CT scan. The recent PET-enabled DECT method allows DECT imaging on PET/CT without requiring a second X-ray CT scan. It combines the already existing X-ray CT image with a 511 keV \gamma-ray CT (gCT) image reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data. A kernelized framework has been developed for reconstructing gCT image but this method has not fully exploited the potential of prior knowledge. Use of deep neural networks may explore the power of deep learning in this application. However, common approaches require a large database for training, which is impractical for a new imaging method like PET-enabled DECT. Here, we propose a single-subject method by using neural-network representation as a deep coefficient prior to improving gCT image reconstruction without population-based pre-training. The resulting optimization problem becomes the tomographic estimation of nonlinear neural-network parameters from gCT projection data. This complicated problem can be efficiently solved by utilizing the optimization transfer strategy with quadratic surrogates. Each iteration of the proposed neural optimization transfer algorithm includes: PET activity image update; gCT image update; and least-square neural-network learning in the gCT image domain. This algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. Results from computer simulation, real phantom data and real patient data have demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly improve gCT image quality and consequent multi-material decomposition as compared to other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: The transmit encoding model for synthetic aperture imaging is a robust and flexible framework for understanding the effects of acoustic transmission on ultrasound image reconstruction. Our objective is to use machine learning (ML) to construct scanning sequences, parameterized by time delays and apodization weights, that produce high-quality B-mode images. Approach: We use a custom ML model in PyTorch with simulated RF data from Field II to probe the space of possible encoding sequences for those that minimize a loss function that describes image quality. This approach is made computationally feasible by a novel formulation of the derivative for delay-and-sum beamforming. Main Results: When trained for a specified experimental setting (imaging domain, hardware restrictions, etc.), our ML model produces optimized encoding sequences that, when deployed in the REFoCUS imaging framework, improve a number of standard quality metrics over conventional sequences including resolution, field of view, and contrast. We demonstrate these results experimentally on both wire targets and a tissue-mimicking phantom. Significance: This work demonstrates that the set of commonly used encoding schemes represent only a narrow subset of those available. Additionally, it demonstrates the value for ML tasks in synthetic transmit aperture imaging to consider the beamformer within the model, instead of purely as a post-processing step.</description>

Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>

Abstract: The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.</description>
