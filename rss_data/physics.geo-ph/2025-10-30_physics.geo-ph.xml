      <title>Toward a Phenomenological Theory of Earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attempt to construct a phenomenological theory of earthquakes is being undertaken by a small research team, which includes the author. We have only taken the first steps towards goal, but the results already obtained convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of the project. This paper is a kind of commentary on the path taken. The paper explains the essence and character of phenomenological theory. It also contains critical comments on alternative approaches to describing earthquakes. The theory is based on the concept of an earthquake source as a dynamic system, the state of which is described by a small number of phenomenological parameters. Within the framework of elementary theory, the source is described by one parameter, called the deactivation coefficient. The most important concept of the proper time of the source has been introduced, the course of which, generally speaking, differs from the course of world time. Dynamic equations describing the evolution of the source are given. The inverse problem of the source is posed, the essence of which is to calculate the phenomenological parameters based on earthquake observation data. Elementary phenomenological theory has already become a practical tool for the experimenter studying specific earthquake time series. The Appendix provides a list of previously unknown properties and patterns of earthquakes that we discovered within the framework of elementary theory. At the same time, it is noted that phenomenology itself does not lead us to a deep understanding of the essence of earthquakes. Sooner or later, the results of a complex of geophysical and physical-mathematical disciplines will lead to such an understanding. We place particular hopes on the theory of phase transitions and the mathematical theory of catastrophes.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based upscaling of rock permeability from pore scale to core scale: effect of training dataset size and sub-core volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permeability characterizes the capacity of porous formations to conduct fluids, thereby governing the performance of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), hydrocarbon extraction, and subsurface energy storage. A reliable assessment of rock permeability is therefore essential for these applications. Direct estimation of permeability from low-resolution CT images of large rock samples offers a rapid approach to obtain permeability data. However, the limited resolution fails to capture detailed pore-scale structural features, resulting in low prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based upscaling method that integrates high-precision pore-scale permeability information into core-scale, low-resolution CT images. In our workflow, the large core sample is partitioned into sub-core volumes, whose permeabilities are predicted using CNNs. The upscaled permeability at the core scale is then determined through a Darcy flow solver based on the predicted sub-core permeability map. Additionally, we examine the optimal sub-core volume size that balances computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This framework effectively incorporates small-scale heterogeneity, enabling accurate permeability upscaling from micrometer-scale pores to centimeter-scale cores.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Sea Ice Drift Estimation in the Arctic Deep Learning Optical Flow on RADARSAT-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation, climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images, has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion, which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Zoeppritz equations: from seismology to medical exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a century ago, Karl Bernhard Zoeppritz derived the equations that determine the reflected and transmitted coefficients at a planar interface for an incident seismic wave. The coefficients so obtained are a function of the elastic parameters of the media on each side of the interface and the angle of incidence. Approximations of the equations have been proposed and used in geophysical exploration, however, full use of the equations and their generalization to multiple layers could offer richer information about the properties of the media and be helpful in medical diagnosis via ultrasound. In this work, we investigate how to extract information from the angle-dependent reflection coefficients, including critical angles and the wave distortion at the interface between two and three media. It is shown that it is possible to separate the effect of density from speed of sound mismatch by measuring amplitudes as a function of angle of incidence (AVA). And examining the critical angle and waveform distortion of the reflected waves can reveal the thickness of an intermediate layer, even with subwavelength resolution. These studies could be integrated into medical imaging and also into the training of artificial intelligence systems that assist in diagnosis. In particular, they could help prevent cerebrovascular accidents by early detection of the formation and hardening of plaque in the arteries that irrigate the brain.</description>
