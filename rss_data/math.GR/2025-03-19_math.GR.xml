      <title>Just infinite quotients of finitely generated subgroups of $PL^+[0,1]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that just infinite quotients of finitely generated subgroups of Richard Thompson's group F are virtually abelian, answering a question of Grigorchuk. We show the same holds for the group of piecewise linear orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the interval, and the group of piecewise projective homeomorphisms of the real line. The latter provides a plethora of examples of nonamenable groups with this property.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of Coxeter group Morse boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connectivity of Morse boundaries of Coxeter groups. We define two conditions on the defining graph of a Coxeter group: wide-avoidant and wide-spherical-avoidant. We show that wide-spherical-avoidant, one-ended, affine-free Coxeter groups have connected and locally connected Morse boundaries. On the other hand, one-ended Coxeter groups that are not wide-avoidant and not wide have disconnected Morse boundary. For the right-angled case, we get a full characterization: a one-ended right-angled Coxeter group has connected, non-empty Morse boundary if and only if it is wide-avoidant. Along the way we characterize Morse geodesic rays in affine-free Coxeter groups as those that spend uniformly bounded time in cosets of wide special subgroups.</description>

      <title>Countably compact inverse semigroups and Nyikos problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regular separable first-countable countably compact space is called a {\em Nyikos} space. In this paper, we give a partial solution to an old problem of Nyikos by showing that each locally compact Nyikos inverse topological semigroup is compact. Also, we show that a topological semigroup $S$ that contains a dense inverse subsemigroup is a topological inverse semigroup, provided (i) $S$ is compact, or (ii) $S$ is countably compact and sequential. The latter result solves a problem of Banakh and Pastukhova and provides the automatic continuity of inversion in certain compact-like inverse semigroups.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite covolume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of divergent diagonal orbits in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a local field $\widehat K$ with positive characteristic, we study the dynamics of the diagonal subgroup of the linear group $\operatorname{GL}_n(\widehat K)$ on homogeneous spaces of discrete lattices in ${\widehat K}^{\,n}$. We first give a function field version of results by Margulis and Tomanov-Weiss, characterizing the divergent diagonal orbits. When $n=2$, we relate the divergent diagonal orbits with the divergent orbits of the geodesic flow in the modular quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(\widehat K)$. Using the (high) entropy method by Einsiedler-Lindentraus et al, we then give a function field version of a result of David-Shapira on the equidistribution of a natural family of these divergent diagonal orbits, with height given by a new notion of discriminant of the orbits.</description>

      <title>Recursive Self-Similarity in Deep Weight Spaces of Neural Architectures: A Fractal and Coarse Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper conceptualizes the Deep Weight Spaces (DWS) of neural architectures as hierarchical, fractal-like, coarse geometric structures observable at discrete integer scales through recursive dilation. We introduce a coarse group action termed the fractal transformation, $T_{r_k} $, acting under the symmetry group $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +) $, to analyze neural parameter matrices or tensors, by segmenting the underlying discrete grid $\Omega$ into $N(r_k)$ fractals across varying observation scales $ r_k $. This perspective adopts a box count technique, commonly used to assess the hierarchical and scale-related geometry of physical structures, which has been extensively formalized under the topic of fractal geometry. We assess the structural complexity of neural layers by estimating the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension of their layers and evaluating a degree of self-similarity. The fractal transformation features key algebraic properties such as linearity, identity, and asymptotic invertibility, which is a signature of coarse structures. We show that the coarse group action exhibits a set of symmetries such as Discrete Scale Invariance (DSI) under recursive dilation, strong invariance followed by weak equivariance to permutations, alongside respecting the scaling equivariance of activation functions, defined by the intertwiner group relations. Our framework targets large-scale structural properties of DWS, deliberately overlooking minor inconsistencies to focus on significant geometric characteristics of neural networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, VGG-16, and a custom CNN validate our approach, demonstrating effective fractal segmentation and structural analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a quadratic-time explicit and computable algorithm to solve the word problem for Artin groups that do not contain any relations of length 3. Furthermore, we prove that, given two geodesic words representing the same element, one can obtain one from the other by using a set of homogeneous relations that never increase the word length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the classification of ranked definably quasi-Frobenius groups of odd type : dihedral configurations are isomorphic to PGL(2, K) for K an algebraically closed field of characteristic other than two; Frobenius groups are spilt and solvable if the characteristic of the underlying field is positive. To achieve this classification, we prove some results on ranked definably linear groups.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all $2$-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which significantly cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched).</description>

      <title>On the quasi-isometric classification of permutational wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of the large-scale geometry of permutational wreath products of the form $F\wr_{H/N}H$, where $H$ is finitely presented and where $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ satisfying a certain assumption of non coarse separation. The main result is a complete classification of such permutational wreath products up to quasi-isometry, building up on previous works from Genevois and Tessera. For instance, we show that, for $d\ge k\ge 2$, $\mathbb{Z}_{n}\wr_{\mathbb{Z}^{k}} \mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m}\wr_{\mathbb{Z}^{k}}\mathbb{Z}^d$ are quasi-isometric if and only if $n$ and $m$ are powers of a common number. We also discuss biLipschitz equivalences between permutational wreath products, their scaling groups, as well as the quasi-isometric classification of other halo products built out of such permutational lamplighters.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem is a characterization of those infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs that admit infinite Eulerian paths. In this article we prove an effective version of the Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs where vertices of infinite degree are allowed, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean. Our results are obtained from a characterization of those finite paths in a graph that can be extended to infinite Eulerian paths.</description>
