      <title>Chemical abundance gradients of organic molecules within a protostellar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially-unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN, we aim to determine if CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly-luminous intermediate mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN yields rotational temperatures of $198 \pm 1.2$ K and $448 \pm 19$ K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of $4\times10^{-8}$ reproduces the CH$_3$OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH$_3$CN needs to be either more compact (within $\sim120$ au versus $\sim240$ au for CH$_3$OH) or exhibiting a factor of $\gtrsim 15$ increase in abundance in the inner $\sim55$ au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN is carbon-grain sublimation.</description>

      <title>Approximating Rayleigh Scattering in Exoplanetary Atmospheres using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces an innovative application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle the intricate challenges of radiative transfer (RT) modeling in exoplanetary atmospheres, with a special focus on efficiently handling scattering phenomena. Traditional RT models often simplify scattering as absorption, leading to inaccuracies. Our approach utilizes PINNs, noted for their ability to incorporate the governing differential equations of RT directly into their loss function, thus offering a more precise yet potentially fast modeling technique. The core of our method involves the development of a parameterized PINN tailored for a modified RT equation, enhancing its adaptability to various atmospheric scenarios. We focus on RT in transiting exoplanet atmospheres using a simplified 1D isothermal model with pressure-dependent coefficients for absorption and Rayleigh scattering. In scenarios of pure absorption, the PINN demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting transmission spectra for diverse absorption profiles. For Rayleigh scattering, the network successfully computes the RT equation, addressing both direct and diffuse stellar light components. While our preliminary results with simplified models are promising, indicating the potential of PINNs in improving RT calculations, we acknowledge the errors stemming from our approximations as well as the challenges in applying this technique to more complex atmospheric conditions. Specifically, extending our approach to atmospheres with intricate temperature-pressure profiles and varying scattering properties, such as those introduced by clouds and hazes, remains a significant area for future development.</description>

      <title>Dust-Gas Coupling in Turbulence- and MHD Wind-Driven Protoplanetary Disks: Implications for Rocky Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of coupling between dust particles and their surrounding gas in protoplanetary disks is quantified by the dimensionless Stokes number. The Stokes number (St) governs particle size and spatial distributions, in turn establishing the dominant mode of planetary accretion in different disk regions. In this paper, we model the characteristic St of particles across time in disks evolving under both turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. In both turbulence- and wind-dominated disks, we find that collisional fragmentation is the limiting mechanism of particle growth, and the water-ice sublimation line constitutes a critical transition point between dust settling, drift, and size regimes.
  The St dichotomy across the ice-line translates to distinct planet formation pathways between the inner and outer disk. While pebble accretion proceeds slowly for rocky embryos within the ice-line (across most of parameter space), it does so rapidly for volatile-rich embryos beyond it, allowing for the growth of giant planet cores before disk dissipation. Through simulations of rocky planet growth, we evaluate the competition between pebble accretion and classical pairwise collisions between planetesimals. We conclude that the dominance of pebble accretion can only be realized in disks that are driven by MHD winds, slow-evolving, and devoid of pressure maxima that may concentrate solids and give rise of planetesimal rings. Such disks are extremely quiescent, with Shakura-Sunyaev turbulence parameters $\alpha_{\nu} \sim 10^{-4}$. We conclude that for most of parameter space corresponding to values of $\alpha_{\nu}$ reflected in observations of protoplanetary disks ($\gtrsim 10^{-4}$), pairwise collisions constitute the dominant pathway of rocky planet accretion. Our results are discussed in the context of super-Earth origins and Earth's accretion history.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Viability Assessment for Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary science is increasingly prioritizing efforts toward direct imaging of planetary systems, with emphasis on those that may enable the detection and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. The recent 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey recommended the development of a space-based direct imaging mission that has subsequently been referred to as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A fundamental challenge in the preparatory work for the HWO search for exo-Earths is the selection of suitable stellar targets. Much of the prior efforts regarding the HWO targets has occurred within the context of exoplanet surveys that have characterized the stellar properties for the nearest stars. The preliminary input catalog for HWO consists of 164 stars, of which 30 are known exoplanet hosts to 70 planets. Here, we provide a dynamical analysis for these 30 systems, injecting a terrestrial planet mass into the Habitable Zone (HZ) and determining the constraints on stable orbit locations due to the influence of the known planets. For each system, we calculate the percentage of the HZ that is dynamically viable for the potential presence of a terrestrial planet, providing an additional metric for inclusion of the stars within the HWO target list. Our analysis shows that, for 11 of the systems, less than 50% of the HZ is dynamically viable, primarily due to the presence of giant planets whose orbits pass near or through the HZ. These results demonstrate the impact that known system architectures can have on direct imaging target selection and overall system habitability.</description>

      <title>Effects of Variable Mass, Disk-Like Structure, and Radiation Pressure on the Dynamics of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we intend to investigate the dynamics of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Here we assumed the primaries as the source of radiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like structure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium points in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like structure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear equilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also breaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the quasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points are stable if the mass ratio $\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\mu_c$. It shows that the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen Loss from Pluto's Birth to the Present Day via Atmospheric Escape, Photochemical Destruction, and Impact Erosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the loss of nitrogen from Pluto over its lifetime, including the giant planet instability period, which we term the "Wild Years." We analyze the orbital migration of 53 simulated Plutinos, which are Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) captured into 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune during the instability. This orbital migration brought the Plutinos from 20 to 30 au to their present-day orbits near 40 au along a nonlinear path that includes orbits with semimajor axes from 10 to 100 au. We model the thermal history that results from this migration and estimate the volatile loss rates due to the ever-changing thermal environment. Due to the early Sun's enhanced ultraviolet radiation, the photochemical destruction rate during the Wild Years was a factor of 100 higher than the present-day rate, but this only results in a loss of ~10 m global equivalent layer (GEL). The enhanced Jeans escape rate varies wildly with time, and a net loss of ~100 cm GEL is predicted. Additionally, we model the impact history during the migration and find that impacts are a net source, not loss, of N2, contributing ~100 cm GEL. The 100 cm GEL is 0.1% of the amount of N2 in Sputnik Planitia. We therefore conclude that Pluto did not lose an excessive amount of volatiles during the Wild Years, and its primordial volatile inventory can be approximated as its present-day inventory. However, significant fractions of this small total loss of N2 occurred during the Wild Years, so estimates made using present-day rates will be underestimates.</description>

      <title>Neglected Silicon Dioxide Polymorphs as Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct mid-infrared signatures of silicate clouds in substellar atmospheres were first detected in Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs, although their existence was previously inferred from near-infrared spectra. With the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instrument on JWST, we can now more deeply probe silicate features from 8 to 10 microns, exploring specific particle composition, size, and structure. Recent characterization efforts have led to the identification in particular of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO$_2$) cloud features in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Previous modeling, motivated by chemical equilibrium considerations, has primarily focused on magnesium silicates (forsterite, enstatite), crystalline quartz, and amorphous silica to match observations. Here, we explore the previously neglected possibility that other crystalline structures of silica, i.e. polymorphs, may be more likely to form at the pressure and temperature conditions of substellar upper atmospheres. We show how these polymorphs may be distinguished from each other with current JWST observations. We also explore how such particles could form and be dynamically lofted and sedimented throughout the atmosphere, and implications for the underlying chemical and dynamical processes governing these objects. We ultimately propose that accounting for the distinct opacities arising from the possible crystalline structure of cloud materials may act as a powerful, observable diagnostic tracer of atmospheric conditions, where particle crystallinity records the history of the atmospheric regions through which clouds formed and evolved. Finally, we highlight that high fidelity, accurate laboratory measurements of silica polymorphs are critically needed to draw meaningful conclusions about the identities and structures of clouds in substellar atmospheres.</description>

      <title>TESS discovery of two super-Earths orbiting the M-dwarf stars TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 near the radius valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the validation of two TESS super-Earth candidates transiting the mid-M dwarfs TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 every 10.90 and 10.44 days, respectively. The first star (TOI-6002) is located $32.038\pm0.019$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2409^{+0.0066}_{-0.0065} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2105^{+0.0049}_{-0.0048} M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3229^{+77}_{-57}$ K. The second star (TOI-5713) is located $40.946\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2653\pm0.0061 M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using TESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based facilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2. TOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19} R_\oplus$ and receives $1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of $1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} R_\oplus$ and receives $2.42\pm{0.11} S_\oplus$. Both planets are located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable zone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future studies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around M-dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>SOLES XI. The Aligned Orbit of TOI-2533 b, a Transiting Brown Dwarf Orbiting an F8-type Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs occupy a middle ground in mass space between gaseous giant planets and ultra-cool dwarf stars, and the characterisation of their orbital orientations may shed light on how these neighbouring objects form. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of TOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\pm0.0090$) and wide-separation ($a_b/R_\star = 13.34\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type star, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival photometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown dwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf system with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -7\pm14^{\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the brown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also indicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\pm5.3$ M$_{\rm \tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we find that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in a primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Bayesian Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation to Exoplanet Atmospheric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, exoplanetary transmission spectra have yielded an unprecedented understanding about the physical and chemical nature of planets outside our solar system. Physical and chemical knowledge is mainly extracted via fitting competing models to spectroscopic data, based on some goodness-of-fit metric. However, current employed metrics shed little light on how exactly a given model is failing at the individual data point level and where it could be improved. As the quality of our data and complexity of our models increases, there is an urgent need to better understand which observations are driving our model interpretations. Here we present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the performance of exoplanet atmospheric models and compute the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd$_\text{LOO}$). elpd$_\text{LOO}$ estimates the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of an atmospheric model at data point resolution providing interpretable model criticism. We introduce and demonstrate this method on synthetic HST transmission spectra of a hot Jupiter. We apply elpd$_\text{LOO}$ to interpret current observations of HAT-P-41b and assess the reliability of recent inferences of H$^-$ in its atmosphere. We find that previous detections of H$^{-}$ are dependent solely on a single data point. This new metric for exoplanetary retrievals complements and expands our repertoire of tools to better understand the limits of our models and data. elpd$_\text{LOO}$ provides the means to interrogate models at the single data point level, a prerequisite for robustly interpreting the imminent wealth of spectroscopic information coming from JWST.</description>

      <title>High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of warm Jupiters: An ESPRESSO sample with predictions for ANDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warm Jupiters are ideal laboratories for testing the limitations of current tools for atmospheric studies. The cross-correlation technique is a commonly used method to investigate the atmospheres of close-in planets, leveraging their large orbital velocities to separate the spectrum of the planet from that of the star. Warm Jupiter atmospheres predominantly consist of molecular species, notably water, methane and carbon monoxide, often accompanied by clouds and hazes muting their atmospheric features. In this study, we investigate the atmospheres of six warm Jupiters K2-139 b, K2-329 b, TOI- 3362 b, WASP-130 b, WASP-106 b, and TOI-677 b to search for water absorption using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, reporting non-detections for all targets. These non-detections are partially attributed to planets having in-transit radial velocity changes that are typically too small to distinguish between the different components (star, planet, Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and telluric contamination), as well as the relatively weak planetary absorption lines as compared to the S/N of the spectra. We simulate observations for the upcoming high-resolution spectrograph ANDES at the Extremely Large Telescope for the two favourable planets on eccentric orbits, TOI-3362b and TOI-677 b, searching for water, carbon monoxide, and methane. We predict a significant detection of water and CO, if ANDES indeed covers the K-band, in the atmospheres of TOI-677 b and a tentative detection of water in the atmosphere of TOI-3362b. This suggests that planets on highly eccentric orbits with favourable orbital configurations present a unique opportunity to access cooler atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A Testbed for Tidal Migration: the 3D Architecture of an Eccentric Hot Jupiter HD 118203 b Accompanied by a Possibly Aligned Outer Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.9^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=5.36^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ AU, $e_{c}=0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) exterior to previously known close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocity observations. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected obliquity $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true obliquity of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is the first hot Jupiter system where both the true obliquity of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

Abstract: The planet GJ 367 b is a recently discovered high-density sub-Earth orbiting an M dwarf star. Its composition was modelled to be predominantly iron with a potential remainder of a hydrogen-helium envelope. Here we report an X-ray detection of this planet's host star for the first time, using data from the spectro-imaging X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission. We characterise the magnetic activity of the host star from the X-ray data and estimate its effects on a potential atmosphere of the planet. We find that despite the very low activity level of the host star the expected mass loss rates, both under core-powered and photoevaporative mass loss regimes, are so high that a potential primordial or outgassed atmosphere would evaporate very quickly. Since the activity level of the host star indicates that the system is several Gigayears old, it is very unlikely that the planet currently still hosts any atmosphere.</description>
