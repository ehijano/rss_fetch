      <title>Device-Free Localization Using Multi-Link MIMO Channels in Distributed Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presented a novel device-free localization (DFL) framework based on distributed antenna networks (DANs), targeting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future 6G radio access networks (RANs). In the proposed approach, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) leverages the spatial and temporal diversity of multi-link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in DANs to improve localization accuracy. Furthermore, a prototype system was developed using software-defined radios (SDRs) operating in the sub-6 GHz band, and comprehensive evaluations were conducted under indoor conditions involving varying node densities and target types. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves sub-meter localization accuracy in most scenarios and maintains robust performance under complex multipath environments. In addition, the use of Bayesian optimization to fine-tune key parameters, such as sparsity and path thickness, led to significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and target estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DAN-based DFL systems for accurate, robust, and scalable localization.</description>

      <title>UX-aware Rate Allocation for Real-Time Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive communications is a key use case for 6G where applications require reliable latency-bound media traffic at a certain data rate to deliver an acceptable User Experience (UX) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The Quality-of-Service (QoS) framework of current cellular systems (4G and 5G) and prevalent network congestion control algorithms for latency-bound traffic like L4S typically target network-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as data rates and latencies. Network capacity is based on the number of users that attain these KPIs. However, the UX of an immersive application for a given data rate and latency is not the same across users, since it depends on other factors such as the complexity of the media being transmitted and the encoder format. This implies that guarantees on network KPIs do not necessarily translate to guarantees on the UX.
  In this paper, we propose a framework in which the communication network can provide guarantees on the UX. The framework requires application servers to share real-time information on UX dependency on data rate to the network, which in turn, uses this information to maximize a UX-based network utility function. Our framework is motivated by the recent industry trends of increasing application awareness at the network, and pushing application servers towards the edge, allowing for tighter coordination between the servers and the 6G system. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework substantially improves the UX capacity of the network, which is the number of users above a certain UX threshold, compared to conventional rate control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient RSMA-Based LEO Satellite Communications Assisted by UAV-Mounted BD-Active RIS: A DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for joint channel estimationand hybrid MIMO precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid precoding is a key ingredient of cost-effective massive multiple-input multiple-output transceivers. However, setting jointly digital and analog precoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization problem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels, which is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems comprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and hybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to-end architecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting precoders. The resulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and interpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step is performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for imperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via unfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.</description>

      <title>Near-Field MIMO Channel Acquisition: Geometry-Aided Feedback and Transmission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field (NF) line-of-sight (LoS) MIMO systems enable efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition and precoding by exploiting known antenna geometries at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). This paper introduces a compact parameterization of the NF LoS MIMO channel using two angles of departure (AoDs) and a BS-UE relative rotation angle. The inclusion of the second AoD removes the need for fine-grained distance grids imposed by conventional NF channel parametrization. To address the user-specific uplink pilot overhead in multiuser NF CSI acquisition, we propose a scheme that uses a fixed, UE-independent set of downlink pilots transmitted from a carefully selected subset of BS antennas. In dominant LoS conditions, as few as four pilots suffice, with Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) analysis confirming that increased antenna spacing improves estimation accuracy. Each UE estimates and quantizes its angular parameters and feeds them back to the BS for geometry-based CSI reconstruction, eliminating the need for full channel feedback. To enhance robustness against noise, quantization errors, and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, we introduce a two-stage precoding method. The initial precoding is computed from estimated LoS CSI and refined through bidirectional over-the-air (OTA) training. Furthermore, a two-step stream allocation strategy reduces pilot and computational overhead. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high data rates with significantly fewer OTA iterations, approaching the performance of perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic-Integrated DRL Approach for Phase Optimization in Large-Scale RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing discrete phase shifts in large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is challenging due to their non-convex and non-linear nature. In this letter, we propose a heuristic-integrated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that (1) leverages accumulated actions over multiple steps in the double deep Q-network (DDQN) for RIS column-wise control and (2) integrates a greedy algorithm (GA) into each DRL step to refine the state via fine-grained, element-wise optimization of RIS configurations. By learning from GA-included states, the proposed approach effectively addresses RIS optimization within a small DRL action space, demonstrating its capability to optimize phase-shift configurations of large-scale RISs.</description>

      <title>SwinLSTM Autoencoder for Temporal-Spatial-Frequency Domain CSI Compression in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a parameter-light, low-complexity artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model that enhances channel state information (CSI) feedback in wireless systems by jointly exploiting temporal, spatial, and frequency (TSF) domain correlations. While traditional frameworks use autoencoders for CSI compression at the user equipment (UE) and reconstruction at the network (NW) side in spatial-frequency (SF), massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems in low mobility scenarios exhibit strong temporal correlation alongside frequency and spatial correlations. An autoencoder architecture alone is insufficient to exploit the TSF domain correlation in CSI; a recurrent element is also required. To address the vanishing gradients problem, researchers in recent works have proposed state-of-the-art TSF domain CSI compression architectures that combine recurrent networks for temporal correlation exploitation with deep pre-trained autoencoder that handle SF domain CSI compression. However, this approach increases the number of parameters and computational complexity. To jointly utilize correlations across the TSF domain, we propose a novel, parameter-light, low-complexity AI/ML-based recurrent autoencoder architecture to compress CSI at the UE side and reconstruct it on the NW side while minimizing CSI feedback overhead.</description>

      <title>Phase Shift Information Compression in IRS-aided Wireless Systems: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a promising technology for future 6G wireless networks, offering programmable control of the wireless environment by adjusting the phase shifts of reflecting elements. However, IRS performance relies on accurately configuring the phase shifts of reflecting elements, which introduces substantial phase shift information (PSI) delivery overhead, especially in large-scale or rapidly changing environments. This paper first introduces the architecture of IRS-assisted systems and highlights real-world use cases where PSI delivery becomes a critical bottleneck. It then reviews current PSI compression approaches, outlining their limitations in adaptability and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose a prompt-guided PSI compression framework that leverages task-aware prompts and meta-learning to achieve efficient and real-time PSI delivery under diverse conditions. Simulation results show improved reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to the baseline method. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Lightweight Phase Shift Compression for IRS-Assisted Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase shift information (PSI) overhead poses a critical challenge to enabling real-time intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless systems, particularly under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight PSI compression framework, termed meta-learning-driven compression and reconstruction network (MCRNet). By leveraging a few-shot adaptation strategy via model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), MCRNet enables rapid generalization across diverse IRS configurations with minimal retraining overhead. Furthermore, a novel depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) module is incorporated into the decoder to achieve adaptive local feature modulation with low computational cost, significantly improving decoding efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that MCRNet achieves competitive normalized mean square error performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various compression ratios, while substantially reducing model size and inference latency. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed asymmetric architecture and highlight the practical scalability and real-time applicability of MCRNet for dynamic IRS-assisted wireless deployments.</description>

      <title>Image Steganography For Securing Intellicise Wireless Networks: "Invisible Encryption" Against Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies for intellicise (intelligent and consice) wireless networks, Semantic Communication (SemCom) significantly improves communication efficiency by extracting, transmitting, and recovering semantic information, while reducing transmission delay. However, an integration of communication and artificial intelligence (AI) also exposes SemCom to security and privacy threats posed by intelligent eavesdroppers. To address this challenge, image steganography in SemCom embeds secret semantic features within cover semantic features, allowing intelligent eavesdroppers to decode only the cover image. This technique offers a form of "invisible encryption" for SemCom. Motivated by these advancements, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of integrating image steganography into SemCom. Firstly, we review existing encryption techniques in SemCom and assess the potential of image steganography in enhancing its security. Secondly, we delve into various image steganographic paradigms designed to secure SemCom, encompassing three categories of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) models tailored for image steganography SemCom, along with multiple training strategies. Thirdly, we present a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of coverless steganography SemCom. Finally, we propose future research directions for image steganography SemCom.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper conducts a comparative study of three IoT-based PRNG models, including Logistic Map, Double Pendulum, and Multi-LFSR, implemented on an FPGA platform. Comparisons are made across key performance metrics like randomness, latency, power consumption, hardware resource usage, energy efficiency, scalability, and application suitability. Compared to Multi-LFSR, Logistic Map, and Double Pendulum Models provide perfect quality randomness, which is quite apt for high-security grade applications; however, the requirements of these models concerning power and hardware resources are also considerably high. By contrast, the Multi-LFSR comes into its own due to its lower latency, power consumption, and resource-efficient design. It is, therefore, suited for embedded or real-time applications. Furthermore, environmental sensors will also be introduced as entropy sources for the PRNGs to enhance the randomness of the systems, particularly in IoT-enabled battery-powered FPGA platforms. The experimental results confirm that the Multi-LFSR model has the highest energy efficiency, while the Logistic Map and Double Pendulum outperform in generating numbers with very high security. The study thus provides a deeper insight into decision-making for selecting PRNG models.</description>

      <title>Modal Decomposition and Identification for a Population of Structures Using Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Aliasing Reduction in Neural Amp Modeling by Smoothing Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio hardware such as vintage guitar amplifiers has led to numerous works in neural-network-based black-box modeling, with deep learning architectures like WaveNet showing promising results. However, a key limitation in all of these models is the aliasing artifacts that arise from the use of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. In this paper, we investigate novel and modified activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier models. Supporting this, we introduce a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.</description>

      <title>On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</description>

      <title>Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04611v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Multiport Network Models and Performance Benefits in Full-Duplex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) is a new advance in RIS techniques that introduces reconfigurable inter-element connections to generate scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal. BD-RIS has been recently proposed and proven to have benefits in enhancing channel gain and enlarging coverage in wireless communications. Uniquely, BD-RIS enables reciprocal and non-reciprocal architectures characterized by symmetric and non-symmetric scattering matrices. However, the performance benefits and new use cases enabled by non-reciprocal BD-RIS for wireless systems remain unexplored. This work takes a first step toward closing this knowledge gap and studies the non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems and its performance benefits over reciprocal counterparts. We start by deriving a general RIS aided full-duplex system model using a multiport circuit theory, followed by a simplified channel model based on physically consistent assumptions. With the considered channel model, we investigate the effect of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and identify the theoretical conditions for reciprocal and non-reciprocal BD-RISs to simultaneously achieve the maximum received power of the signal of interest in the uplink and the downlink. Simulation results validate the theories and highlight the significant benefits offered by non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems. The significant gains are achieved because of the non-reciprocity principle which implies that if a wave hits the non-reciprocal BD-RIS from one direction, the surface behaves differently than if it hits from the opposite direction. This enables an uplink user and a downlink user at different locations to optimally communicate with the same full-duplex base station via a non-reciprocal BD-RIS, which would not be possible with reciprocal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>User Selection in Near-Field Gigantic MIMO Systems with Modular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular Arrays (MAs) are a promising architecture to enable multi-user communications in next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on extra-large (XL) or gigantic MIMO (gMIMO) deployments, trading off improved spatial resolution with characteristic interference patterns associated with grating lobes. In this work, we analyze whether MAs can outperform conventional collocated deployments, in terms of achievable sum-spectral efficiency (SE) and served users in a multi-user downlink set-up. First, we provide a rigorous analytical characterization of the inter-user interference for modular gMIMO systems operating in the near field. Then, we leverage these results to optimize the user selection and precoding mechanisms, designing two algorithms that largely outperform existing alternatives in the literature, with different algorithmic complexities. Results show that the proposed algorithms yield over 70% improvements in achievable sum-spectral efficiencies compared to the state of the art. We also illustrate how MAs allows us to serve a larger number of users thanks to their improved spatial resolution, compared to the collocated counterpart.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Wavefront Curvature and Spatial Correlation in Noncoherent MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncoherent communication systems have regained interest due to the growing demand for high-mobility and low-latency applications. Most existing studies using large antenna arrays rely on the far-field approximation, which assumes locally plane wavefronts. This assumption becomes inaccurate at higher frequencies and shorter ranges, where wavefront curvature plays a significant role and antenna arrays may operate in the radiative near field. In this letter, we adopt a model for the channel spatial correlation matrix that remains valid in both near and far field scenarios. Using this model, we demonstrate that energy-based noncoherent systems can leverage the benefits of wavefront spherical curvature, even beyond the Fraunhofer distance, revealing that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate system performance. Moreover, we show that large antenna arrays enable the multiplexing of various users even with a noncoherent processing, as well as permitting near-optimal detection with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Enabled Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a contactless and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring human behavior in applications such as personalized healthcare, ambient assisted living, and telemedicine. However, real-world deployment is frequently challenged by domain shifts arising from inter-subject variability, heterogeneous physical environments, and unseen activity patterns, resulting in significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns transferable representations without access to target-domain data. DGAR integrates instance-adaptive feature modulation with cross-domain distribution alignment to enhance both personalization and generalization. Specifically, it incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to extract salient spatiotemporal features and employs correlation alignment to mitigate inter-domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public RF-based datasets -- HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM -- demonstrate that DGAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 5.81% improvement in weighted F1-score. These results underscore DGAR's potential to enable generalizable, real-time RF sensing systems in dynamic and personalized healthcare scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Electrode Shift on Classification Performance in Electromyography-Based Motion Prediction Using Sliding-Window Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are used in many applications, including prosthetic hands, assistive suits, and rehabilitation. Recent advances in motion estimation have improved performance, yet challenges remain in cross-subject generalization, electrode shift, and daily variations. When electrode shift occurs, both transfer learning and adversarial domain adaptation improve classification performance by reducing the performance gap to -1\% (eight-class scenario). However, additional data are needed for re-training in transfer learning or for training in adversarial domain adaptation. To address this issue, we investigated a sliding-window normalization (SWN) technique in a real-time prediction scenario. This method combines z-score normalization with a sliding-window approach to reduce the decline in classification performance caused by electrode shift. We validated the effectiveness of SWN using experimental data from a target trajectory tracking task involving the right arm. For three motions classification (rest, flexion, and extension of the elbow) obtained from EMG signals, our offline analysis showed that SWN reduced the differential classification accuracy to -1.0\%, representing a 6.6\% improvement compared to the case without normalization (-7.6\%). Furthermore, when SWN was combined with a strategy that uses a mixture of multiple electrode positions, classification accuracy improved by an additional 2.4\% over the baseline. These results suggest that SWN can effectively reduce the performance degradation caused by electrode shift, thereby enhancing the practicality of EMG-based motion estimation systems.</description>

      <title>Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</description>

      <title>Design of a compact low loss 2-way millimetre wave power divider for future communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rectangular-shaped power divider has been presented operating at 27.9 GHz. The power divider has achieved acceptable results for important parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for the power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power divider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the bandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due to its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for millimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT for IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</description>
