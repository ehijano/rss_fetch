      <title>Random walks with echoed steps I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24881v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random walk with echoed steps (RWES) is a process $\{\tilde{S}_n\}_{n\geq1}=\{\tilde{X}_1+\cdots+\tilde{X}_n\}_{n\geq1}$ that inserts memory and echo into an ordinary random walk (ORW) with i.i.d. steps, $X_1+\cdots+X_n$. The RWES is defined recursively as follows. Let $\tilde{S}_1=X_1$. With probability $1-p$, the $n$-th increment of the RWES follows that of the ORW, $\tilde{X}_n=X_n$. Otherwise, $\tilde{X}_n$ is set as a random echo of a uniform sample of the past steps $\tilde{X}_1,\dots,\tilde{X}_{n-1}$ determined by a random factor $\xi_n$. Namely, $\tilde{X}_n=\xi_n\tilde{X}_{\mathcal{U}[n]}$ with probability $p$, where $\mathcal{U}[n]\sim$Uniform$\{1,\dots,n-1\}$. The RWES is a broad generalization of the elephant random walk and of the positively/negatively/unbalanced step-reinforced random walks. We determine strong convergences of $\tilde{S}$ when the echo law $\xi$ is non-negative. The rates of convergence are determined by the product $p\mathbb{E}\xi$ and exhibit a phase transition with critical value at $p\mathbb{E}\xi=1$. Highlight that in its super-critical regime, the RWES has super-linear scaling exponents --observed for the first time in this type of random walks with memory--. We provide Laws of Large Numbers, conditions for the convergence of $\tilde{S}$ around its mean towards random series and provide some distributional properties of the limits. Our approach relies on the interpretation of the model in terms of continuous time branching random walks, random recursive trees, P\'olya urns, and associated martingales.</description>

      <title>Computational thresholds in high-dimensional statistics: the case of graph alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the graph alignment problem from the perspective of high-dimensional statistics: we aim to estimate an unknown permutation $\pi^*$ from the observation of two correlated random adjacency matrices $A_1$, $A_2$.
  We establish the following computational thresholds. For $A_1$, $A_2$ the adjacency matrices of two correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs ${\mathcal {G}}(n,p)$ in the sparse regime with average degree $\lambda:=np= O(1)$ and edge correlation parameter $s\in(0,1)$, we identify a critical threshold $s^*(\lambda)$ for $s$ above which a message-passing, local algorithm succeeds at alignment, and below which no local algorithm succeeds. This result crucially depends on an associated model of correlated random trees.
  We then consider the case where $A_1$, $A_2$ are two correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with correlation parameter $s=1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$ for some noise parameter $\sigma$. For a fast spectral algorithm, we identify the critical scaling for noise parameter $\sigma$ at which the fraction of entries of $\pi^*$ correctly recovered goes from $1-o(1)$ to $o(1)$. We next consider the convex relaxation approach which obtains the doubly stochastic matrix $X$ that minimizes $\|X A_1 -A_2 X\|_F$. We obtain upper and lower bounds on the critical noise parameter $\sigma$ at which a simple post-processing of $X$ correctly recovers a fraction $1-o(1)$ of entries of $\pi^*$.
  We finally identify promising future directions on i) computational thresholds for spectral methods and convex relaxation methods of practical interest, and ii) impossibility results for broad classes of algorithms, notably low degree polynomial algorithms and local search algorithms.</description>

      <title>A new look at perfect simulation for chains with infinite memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce two new perfect simulation algorithms for chains with infinite memory. Both algorithms belong to the coupling of past procedures. The novelty of our approach is that it allows to include unknown states to the possible past symbols such that we can also deal with sparsely distributed past dependencies. In our first algorithm, spontaneous occurrence of symbols is possible. This means that there is a positive probability that the chain chooses the next symbol independently of the past. Our second algorithm deals with the case in which spontaneous occurrence of symbols is not possible. Chains with infinite memory are discrete-time stochastic processes in which the distribution of the next symbol depends on all past symbols. These transition probabilities are described by a probability kernel. Our results give conditions on the way the dependency of the transition kernel on long past strings decays, guaranteeing that our algorithms stop after a finite number of steps almost surely. Strengthening these conditions, we show that the mean number of steps of our algorithms is finite. We discuss the consequence of having a coupling from the past algorithm with such properties and we present examples in which our results can be applied while others result in the literature cannot be applied.</description>

      <title>Universality of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly-periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish conformal invariance of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly periodic graphs, showing that their scaling limit coincides with that of the critical square lattice, as originally proved in \cite{CHI}. To overcome the absence of integrability and quantitative full plane constructions in the periodic setting, we combine discrete analytic tools with random cluster methods. This result completes the universality picture for periodic lattices, whose criticality condition was identified in \cite{cimasoni-duminil} and whose conformal structure and interface convergence were obtained in \cite{Che20}.</description>

      <title>$L^{\alpha-1}$ distance between two one-dimensional stochastic differential equations with drift terms driven by a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a quantitative stability theory for one-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-zero drift, driven by a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process for $\alpha\in(1,2)$. Our work generalizes the classical pathwise comparison method, pioneered by Komatsu for uniqueness problems, to address the stability of SDEs featuring both non-zero drift and, crucially, time-dependent coefficients. We provide the first explicit convergence rates for this broad class of SDEs. The main result is a H\"older-type estimate for the $L^{\alpha-1}(\Omega)$ distance between two solution paths, which quantifies the stability with respect to the initial values and coefficients. A key innovation of our approach is the measurement of the distance between coefficients. Instead of using a standard supremum norm, which would impose restrictive conditions, we introduce a weighted integral norm constructed from the transition probability density of the baseline solution. This technique, which generalizes the framework of Nakagawa \cite{Nakagawa}, is essential for handling time-dependent perturbations and effectively localizes the error analysis. The proof is based on a refined analysis of a mollified auxiliary function, for which we establish a new, sharper derivative estimate to control the drift terms. Finally, we apply these stability results to derive corresponding convergence rates in probability, providing an upper bound for the tail probability of the uniform distance between solution paths.</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>On the injective norm of random fermionic states and skew-symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the injective norm of random skew-symmetric tensors and the associated fermionic quantum states, a natural measure of multipartite entanglement for systems of indistinguishable particles. Extending recent advances on random quantum states, we analyze both real and complex skew-symmetric Gaussian ensembles in two asymptotic regimes: fixed particle number with increasing one-particle Hilbert space dimension, and joint scaling with fixed filling fraction. Using the Kac--Rice formula on the Grassmann manifold, we derive high-probability upper bounds on the injective norm and establish sharp asymptotics in both regimes. Interestingly, a duality relation under particle--hole transformation is uncovered, revealing a symmetry of the injective norm under the action of the Hodge star operator. We complement our analytical results with numerical simulations for low fermion numbers, which match the predicted bounds.</description>

      <title>Fast Dimensionality Reduction from $\ell_2$ to $\ell_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a fundamental result in dimensionality reduction, ensuring that any finite set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^k$ while approximately preserving all pairwise Euclidean distances. In recent years, embeddings that preserve Euclidean distances when measured via the $\ell_1$ norm in the target space have received increasing attention due to their relevance in applications such as nearest neighbor search in high dimensions. A recent breakthrough by Dirksen, Mendelson, and Stollenwerk established an optimal $\ell_2 \to \ell_1$ embedding with computational complexity $O(d \log d)$. In this work, we generalize this direction and propose a simple linear embedding from $\ell_2$ to $\ell_p$ for any $p \in [1,2]$ based on a construction of Ailon and Liberty. Our method achieves a reduced runtime of $O(d \log k)$ when $k \leq d^{1/4}$, improving upon prior runtime results when the target dimension is small. Additionally, we show that for \emph{any norm} $\|\cdot\|$ in the target space, any embedding of $(\mathbb{R}^d, \|\cdot\|_2)$ into $(\mathbb{R}^k, \|\cdot\|)$ with distortion $\varepsilon$ generally requires $k = \Omega\big(\varepsilon^{-2} \log(\varepsilon^2 n)/\log(1/\varepsilon)\big)$, matching the optimal bound for the $\ell_2$ case up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>On the instability of local learning algorithms: Q-learning can fail in infinite state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of applying model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, like online Q-learning, to infinite state space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We first introduce the notion of Local Learning Processes (LLPs), where agents make decisions based solely on local information, and we show that Q-learning can be seen as a specific instance of an LLP. Using renewal techniques, we analyze LLPs and demonstrate their instability under certain drift and initial conditions, revealing fundamental limitations in infinite state spaces. In particular, we show that while asymptotically optimal in finite settings, Q-learning can face instability and strict sub-optimality in infinite spaces. Our findings are illustrated through queueing system examples drawn from load balancing and server allocation. The study underscores the need for new theoretical frameworks and suggests future research into nonlocal Q-learning variants.</description>

      <title>Liquid-vapor transition in a model of a continuum particle system with finite-range modified Kac pair potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a phase transition in dimension $d&gt;1$ in a continuum particle system interacting with a pair potential containing a modified attractive Kac potential of range $\gamma^{-1}$, with $\gamma&gt;0$. This transition is "close", for small positive $\gamma$, to the one proved previously by Lebowitz and Penrose in the van der Waals limit $\gamma\downarrow0$. It is of the type of the liquid-vapor transition observed when a fluid, like water, heated at constant pressure, boils at a given temperature. Previous results on phase transitions in continuum systems with stable potentials required the use of unphysical four-body interactions or special symmetries between the liquid and vapor.
  The pair interaction we consider is obtained by partitioning space into cubes of volume $\gamma^{-d}$, and letting the Kac part of the pair potential be uniform in each cube and act only between adjacent cubes. The "short-range" part of the pair potential is quite general (in particular, it may or may not include a hard core), but restricted to act only between particles in the same cube.
  Our setup, the "boxed particle model", is a special case of a general "spin" system, for which we establish a first-order phase transition using reflection positivity and the Dobrushin--Shlosman criterion.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis for an implementable scheme to solve the linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problem with stochastic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem for the stochastic wave equation driven by affine multiplicative noise, formulated as a stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ) problem. By applying a stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle, we characterize the optimal state-control pair via a coupled forward-backward SPDE system. We propose an implementable discretization using conforming finite elements in space and an implicit midpoint rule in time. By a new technical approach we obtain strong convergence rates for the discrete state-control pair without relying on Malliavin calculus. For the practical computation we develop a gradient-descent algorithm based on artificial iterates that employs an exact computation for the arising conditional expectations, thereby eliminating costly Monte Carlo sampling. Consequently, each iteration has a computational cost that is proportional to the number of spatial degrees of freedom, producing a scalable method that preserves the established strong convergence rates. Numerical results validate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Large-Time Analysis of the Langevin Dynamics for Energies Fulfilling Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we take a step towards understanding overdamped Langevin dynamics for the minimization of a general class of objective functions $\mathcal{L}$. We establish well-posedness and regularity of the law $\rho_t$ of the process through novel a priori estimates, and, very importantly, we characterize the large-time behavior of $\rho_t$ under truly minimal assumptions on $\mathcal{L}$. In the case of integrable Gibbs density, the law converges to the normalized Gibbs measure. In the non-integrable case, we prove that the law diffuses. The rate of convergence is $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$. Under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on $\mathcal{L}$, we also derive sharp exponential contractivity results toward the set of global minimizers. Combining these results we provide the first systematic convergence analysis of Langevin dynamics under PL conditions in non-integrable Gibbs settings: a first phase of exponential in time contraction toward the set of minimizers and then a large-time exploration over it with rate $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formation in Diffusive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the formation of clusters for stochastic interacting particle systems (SIPS) that interact through short-range attractive potentials in a periodic domain. We consider kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics and focus on the low-friction regime. Employing a linear stability analysis for the kinetic McKean-Vlasov equation, we show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, and for sufficiently short-ranged interactions, the particles form clusters that correspond to metastable states of the mean-field dynamics. We derive the friction and particle-count dependent cluster-formation time and numerically measure the friction-dependent times to reach a stationary state (given by a state in which all particles are bound in a single cluster). By providing both theory and numerical methods in the inertial stochastic setting, this work acts as a bridge between cluster formation studies in overdamped Langevin dynamics and the Hamiltonian (microcanonical) limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastically perturbed wave maps from $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into $\mathbb{S}^d$, in all energy-supercritical dimensions $d \geq 3$. We show that corotational non-degenerate Gaussian additive noise leads to self-similar blowup with positive probability for any corotational initial data. The same result without noise is conjectured, but unknown, for large data.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of homogenized invariant measures from multiscale data via Hermite expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of density estimation in the context of multiscale Langevin diffusion processes, where a single-scale homogenized surrogate model can be derived. In particular, our aim is to learn the density of the invariant measure of the homogenized dynamics from a continuous-time trajectory generated by the full multiscale system. We propose a spectral method based on a truncated Fourier expansion with Hermite functions as orthonormal basis. The Fourier coefficients are computed directly from the data owing to the ergodic theorem. We prove that the resulting density estimator is robust and converges to the invariant density of the homogenized model as the scale separation parameter vanishes, provided the time horizon and the number of Fourier modes are suitably chosen in relation to the multiscale parameter. The accuracy and reliability of this methodology is further demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A mathematical study of the excess growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the excess growth rate -- a fundamental logarithmic functional arising in portfolio theory -- from the perspective of information theory. We show that the excess growth rate can be connected to the R\'{e}nyi and cross entropies, the Helmholtz free energy, L. Campbell's measure of average code length and large deviations. Our main results consist of three axiomatic characterization theorems of the excess growth rate, in terms of (i) the relative entropy, (ii) the gap in Jensen's inequality, and (iii) the logarithmic divergence that generalizes the Bregman divergence. Furthermore, we study maximization of the excess growth rate and compare it with the growth optimal portfolio. Our results not only provide theoretical justifications of the significance of the excess growth rate, but also establish new connections between information theory and quantitative finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be an irreducible and reversible transition matrix on a finite state space $V$ with invariant distribution $\pi$. We let $k$ chains start by choosing independent locations distributed according to $\pi$ and then they evolve independently according to $P$. Let $\tau_{\mathrm{cov}}(k)$ be the first time that every vertex of $V$ has been visited at least once by at least one chain and let $t_{\rm{cov}}(k)=\mathbb{E}[\tau_{\mathrm{cov}}(k)]$ with $t_{\rm{cov}}=t_{\rm{cov}}(1)$. We prove that $t_{\rm{cov}}(k)\lesssim t_{\rm{cov}}/k$. When $k\leq t_{\mathrm{cov}}/t_{\rm{rel}}$, where $t_{\rm{rel}}$ is the inverse of the spectral gap, we show that this bound is sharp. For $k\leq t_{\mathrm{cov}}/t_{\rm{mix}}$ with $t_{\rm{mix}}$ the total variation mixing time of $(P+I)/2$ we prove that $k \cdot \max_{x_1,\ldots,x_k}\mathbb{E}_{x_1,\ldots,x_k}[\tau_{\rm{cov}}(k)] \asymp t_{\rm{cov}}$.</description>

Abstract: We verify the existence of density functions of the running maximum of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a Brownian motion and a non-truncated stable process. This is proved by the existence of density functions of the running maximum of Wiener-Poisson functionals resulting from Bismut's approach to Malliavin calculus for jump processes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of arm exponents in planar FK-percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the FKG inequality for FK-percolation, the probability of the alternating two-arm event is smaller than the product of the probabilities of having a primal arm and a dual arm, respectively. In this paper, we improve this inequality by a polynomial factor for critical planar FK-percolation in the continuous phase transition regime ($1 \leq q \leq 4$). In particular, we prove that if the alternating two-arm exponent $\alpha_{01}$ and the one-arm exponents $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ exist, then they satisfy the strict inequality $\alpha_{01} &gt; \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$. The question was formulated by Garban and Steif in the context of exceptional times and was brought to our attention by Radhakrishnan and Tassion, who obtained the same result for planar Bernoulli percolation through different methods.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>A mild rough Gronwall Lemma with applications to non-autonomous evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <title>Score-Aware Policy-Gradient and Performance Guarantees using Local Lyapunov Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a policy-gradient method for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that exploits a type of stationary distributions commonly obtained from Markov decision processes (MDPs) in stochastic networks, queueing systems, and statistical mechanics. Specifically, when the stationary distribution of the MDP belongs to an exponential family that is parametrized by policy parameters, we can improve existing policy gradient methods for average-reward RL. Our key identification is a family of gradient estimators, called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs), that enable policy gradient estimation without relying on value-function estimation in the aforementioned setting. We show that SAGE-based policy-gradient locally converges, and we obtain its regret. This includes cases when the state space of the MDP is countable and unstable policies can exist. Under appropriate assumptions such as starting sufficiently close to a maximizer and the existence of a local Lyapunov function, the policy under SAGE-based stochastic gradient ascent has an overwhelming probability of converging to the associated optimal policy. Furthermore, we conduct a numerical comparison between a SAGE-based policy-gradient method and an actor-critic method on several examples inspired from stochastic networks, queueing systems, and models derived from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that a SAGE-based method finds close-to-optimal policies faster than an actor-critic method.</description>

      <title>Linear Operator Approximate Message Passing (OpAMP)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for approximate message passing (AMP) in dynamic settings where the data at each iteration is passed through a linear operator. This framework is motivated in part by applications in large-scale, distributed computing where only a subset of the data is available at each iteration. An autoregressive memory term is used to mitigate information loss across iterations and a specialized algorithm, called projection AMP, is designed for the case where each linear operator is an orthogonal projection. Precise theoretical guarantees are provided for a class of Gaussian matrices and non-separable denoising functions. Specifically, it is shown that the iterates can be well-approximated in the high-dimensional limit by a Gaussian process whose second-order statistics are defined recursively via state evolution. These results are applied to the problem of estimating a rank-one spike corrupted by additive Gaussian noise using partial row updates, and the theory is validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple alternative proof of Royen's Gaussian Correlation inequality by using (a slightly generalized version of) Nakamura-Tsuji's symmetric inverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for even log-concave functions. We explain that this inverse inequality is in a certain sense a dual counterpart to the forward inequality of Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao and Valdimarsson, and that the log-concavity assumption therein cannot be omitted in general.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov.
  Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>
