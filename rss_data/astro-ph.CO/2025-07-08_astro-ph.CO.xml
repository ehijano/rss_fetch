      <title>Unveiling the dark Universe with HI and EMBER-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.</description>

      <title>The final WaZP galaxy cluster catalog of the Dark Energy Survey and comparison with SZE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present and characterize the galaxy cluster catalog detected by the WaZP cluster finder, which is not based on red-sequence identification, on the full six years of observations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y6). The full catalog contains over 400k detected clusters with richnesses, Ngals, above 5 and that reach redshifts up to 1.3. We also provide a version of the catalog where the observation depth and richness computation are homogenized to be used for cosmology, containing 33k rich (Ngals &gt;25) clusters. We compare our results with the previous WaZP catalog obtained from the DES first-year data release (DES-Y1). We find that essentially all clusters within the common footprint and depth limit are recovered. The deeper observations on DES-Y6 and the more complete available spectroscopic redshift sample lead to improvements in the redshifts of the clusters, resulting in an average scatter of 1.4% and offset of 0.2%. The optical clusters are also cross-matched with Sunyaev Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) cluster samples detected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We find that essentially all SZE clusters with reasonable overlapping footprint have a corresponding WaZP cluster. Conversely, 90% of the optical detections with richness greater than 150 have a counterpart in the deeper regions of the SZE surveys. Based on cross-match with the SZE catalogs, we also find that 15-20% of the SZE matched systems have more than one possible WaZP counterpart at the same redshift and within the SZE R500c, indicating possible interacting or unrelaxed systems. Finally, given the optical and SZE beams, WaZP and SZE centerings are found to be consistent. A more detailed study of the SZE-WaZP mass-richness relation will be presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of the field-level inference and conventional analyses on large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simple setup with dark matter halos in real space, with the amplitude of the linear density field $A$ as the only free cosmological parameter. We show that Eulerian perturbation theory is adequate for describing this system on large scales, compute the leading $n$-point functions and perform a joint power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum analysis. Beyond the bispectrum which is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between $A$ and the linear bias, we find that addition of the trispectrum reduces the error on $A$ by only $20-30\%$. Our results for the joint analysis are in good agreement with recent field-level analyses in the same setup. This implies that the field-level inference on large scales does not get significant information from large displacements beyond those in Eulerian kernels or higher-order $n$-point functions beyond the trispectrum. We provide further evidence for this showing that the dependence of the error bars on the maximum wavenumbers used in the analysis is the same in the two approaches. Our results are in disagreement with some of the recent joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using likelihood-free inference based on perturbative forward modeling. We discuss a possible origin of this discrepancy and highlight the importance of resolving it in order to have the optimal results in cosmological analyses based on perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Assumption in the Estimation of Parameters for Dark Energy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae have provided fundamental observational data in the discovery of the late acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in cosmology. However, this analysis has relied on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the data, a hypothesis that can be challenged with the increasing volume and precision of available supernova data. In this work, we rigorously assess this Gaussianity hypothesis and analyze its impact on parameter estimation for dark energy cosmological models. We utilize the Pantheon+ dataset and perform a comprehensive statistical, analysis including the Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera tests, to assess the normality of both the data and model residuals. We find that the Gaussianity assumption is untenable and that the redshift distribution is more accurately described by a t-distribution, as indicated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parameters are estimated for a model incorporating a nonlinear cosmological interaction for the dark sector. The free parameters are estimated using multiple methods, and bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for them.</description>

      <title>Confronting Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation-of-State with ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that equation-of-state formalism comes up with excellent fit to the latest data. In the process we are also able to put stringent constraint on the two model parameters. In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r&lt;0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. We find that equation-of-state formalism has a wide range of parameter values consistent with recent observational data set along with futuristic CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing PTA measurements via early seeding of supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways. Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs, with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $&gt; 10^9 M_\odot$ binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z&lt; 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis further suggests that the seed number density should be $&lt; \mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.</description>

      <title>Can Orbital Decay of Accreting Binary Pulsars Probe Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of holographic dark energy with non-minimally coupled scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider FRW universe filled with matter, non-minimally coupling (NMC) scalar field under $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi^{2}$ potential and holographic vacuum energy. Dark energy is contributed from both holographic vacuum energy and the NMC scalar field. NMC effective gravitational constant $G_\text{eff}(\phi)$, is naturally defined at the action level. Therefore, the gravitational constant in the holographic vacuum density is an effective one, i.e. $ \rho_{\Lambda} = {3c^{2}}/{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}L^{2}}\,. $ Apparent horizon is chosen as IR holographic cutoff scale as it is a trapped null surface. There are nine fixed points in this dynamical system with four independent dimensionless parameters. We consider flat case and find that viable cosmological evolution follows the sequence: an initial stiff-fluid-dominated phase, transitioning through a nearly dust-dominated era, and eventually reaching a stable dark energy-dominating state. Stability analysis requires that $\xi &lt;0$ and $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$ for the theory to be physically valid. Since zero NMC coupling, $\xi=0$, is not allowed in the autonomous system, the model can not completely recover canonical scalar field case. That is to say, as $\xi \rightarrow 0^-$ and $c \rightarrow 0^+$, the model can only approach the canonical scalar case but can not completely recover it. To approach dust or stiff fluid dominations, both magnitudes of the NMC coupling and the holographic parameter must be small. Numerical integration shows that for any allowed values of $\xi$ and $c$, $w_\text{eff}$ approaches $-1$ at late times. Increasing of $c$ does not change shape of the $w_{\rm eff}$, but larger $c$ increases $w_\text{eff}$. As $\xi$ becomes stronger, dust era gradually disappears. Good behaviors of the dynamics require $-1 \ll \xi &lt;0$ and $0 &lt; c \ll 1$.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF-10: A Novel Method for Measuring Integrated Galaxy Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light (EBL) using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using non-standard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency (CTE) degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with Source Extractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 microns) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.</description>

      <title>On the computational feasibility of Bayesian end-to-end analysis of LiteBIRD simulations within Cosmoglobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the computational feasibility of end-to-end Bayesian analysis of the JAXA-led LiteBIRD experiment by analysing simulated time ordered data (TOD) for a subset of detectors through the Cosmoglobe and Commander3 framework. The data volume for the simulated TOD is 1.55 TB, or 470 GB after Huffman compression. From this we estimate a total data volume of 238 TB for the full three year mission, or 70 TB after Huffman compression. We further estimate the running time for one Gibbs sample, from TOD to cosmological parameters, to be approximately 3000 CPU hours. The current simulations are based on an ideal instrument model, only including correlated 1/f noise. Future work will consider realistic systematics with full end-to-end error propagation. We conclude that these requirements are well within capabilities of future high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Supernova Feedback on Satellites in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11 elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{*} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below $10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy and their satellites in simulations.</description>

      <title>The Creation of Particles in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is the Ph.D. thesis of Leonard Parker, submitted to Harvard University in 1966. Over the decades, several generations of physicists have been introduced to the concept of particle creation by gravitational fields, a phenomenon that has become a cornerstone in exploring the interplay between gravitation and quantum theory. Yet, the foundational breakthrough that led to the prediction and understanding of this phenomenon remains unfamiliar to many. In the interest of historical accuracy and in recognition of a seminal contribution to physics, the thesis has been retyped and made it freely available as an open-access (arXiv) document. The reissued thesis is accompanied by a Foreword that places the work in its proper historical context.
  As the team responsible for this new edition, we (Antonio Ferreiro, Jos\'e Navarro-Salas, and Silvia Pla) hope that future generations will continue to draw inspiration from this pioneering text.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble Tension: Insights from Reversible and Irreversible Thermodynamic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of reversible and irreversible thermodynamic processes in a cosmological context, focusing on their impact on the early and late-time expansion history of the universe. In our framework, gravitationally induced adiabatic matter creation/annihilation are treated as irreversible processes, while energy exchange between the cosmic bulk and the horizon is modeled as reversible. We propose two thermodynamic interacting scenarios with matter creation/annihilation in which energy flows from matter and radiation components to an effective entropic dark energy sector. In both scenarios, effective entropic dark energy initially exhibits properties akin to those of radiation and matter prior to recombination. Subsequently, it transitions into a quintessence state, ultimately converging towards the cosmological constant in the current epoch. Our models predict Hubble constant values of $H_0 = 71.73 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 71.06 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, which exhibit agreement with the recent 2024 SH0ES measurement of $H_0 = 73.17 \pm 0.86 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at levels of $1.2\sigma$ and $1.8\sigma$. When compared to the 2022 SH0ES baseline measurement of $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, both models demonstrate concordance at $1\sigma$ and $1.5\sigma$. These results demonstrate that such thermodynamically motivated interactions can address the Hubble tension within a minimal extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Counting mass with Gaia: Mass Density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <title>A demonstration of the effect of fringe-rate filtering in the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array delay power spectrum pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio interferometers targeting the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations at high redshift are subject to systematic effects that operate over a range of different timescales. These can be isolated by designing appropriate Fourier filters that operate in fringe-rate (FR) space, the Fourier pair of local sidereal time (LST). Applications of FR filtering include separating effects that are correlated with the rotating sky vs. those relative to the ground, down-weighting emission in the primary beam sidelobes, and suppressing noise. FR filtering causes the noise contributions to the visibility data to become correlated in time however, making interpretation of subsequent averaging and error estimation steps more subtle. In this paper, we describe fringe rate filters that are implemented using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, and designed for two different purposes -- beam sidelobe/horizon suppression (the `mainlobe' filter), and ground-locked systematics removal (the `notch' filter). We apply these to simulated data, and study how their properties affect visibilities and power spectra generated from the simulations. Included is an introduction to fringe-rate filtering and a demonstration of fringe-rate filters applied to simple situations to aid understanding.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

      <title>Refining the nonlinear modelling of primordial oscillatory features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial oscillatory features in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are sensitive probes of the dynamics of the early Universe and can provide insights beyond the standard inflationary scenario. While these features have been the focus of extensive studies using cosmic microwave background anisotropy data, large-scale structure surveys now provide competitive constraints with the opportunity to probe their effects at smaller scales with higher precision. In this paper, we present a complete description of the nonlinear model for primordial oscillatory features in the context of time-sliced perturbation theory extending the results already presented in the literature. We derive analytical expressions including novel contributions such as the mixed term between primordial oscillations and baryon acoustic oscillations, and we also calculate the corrections arising from the specific envelope of the oscillatory pattern, corresponding to a scale-dependent amplitude. These results are compared with N-body simulations using the COLA method and show consistent behaviour across different scales. Although the corrections are found to be small, they represent an important step to fully characterising the nonlinear imprints of primordial features on the matter power spectrum. Our results offer new calculations to be tested with future cosmological surveys that seek to detect these subtle signatures in the matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Exploring HOD-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 Full-Shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the robustness of the DESI 2024 cosmological inference from the full shape of the galaxy power spectrum to uncertainties in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model of the galaxy-halo connection and the choice of priors on nuisance parameters. We assess variations in the recovered cosmological parameters across a range of mocks populated with different HOD models and find that shifts are often greater than 20\% of the expected statistical uncertainties from the DESI data. We encapsulate the effect of such shifts in terms of a systematic covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm HOD}$, and an additional diagonal contribution quantifying the impact of our choice of nuisance parameter priors on the ability of the effective field theory (EFT) model to correctly recover the cosmological parameters of the simulations. These two covariance contributions are designed to be added to the usual covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm stat}$, describing the statistical uncertainty in the power spectrum measurement, in order to fairly represent these sources of systematic uncertainty. This novel approach should be more general and robust to the choice of model or additional external datasets used in cosmological fits than the alternative approach of adding systematic uncertainties to the recovered marginalised parameter posteriors. We compare the approaches within the context of a fixed $\Lambda$CDM model and demonstrate that our method gives conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty that nevertheless have little impact on the final posteriors obtained from DESI data.</description>

      <title>Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ Universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature (e.g. rapid assembly; relative velocities between baryons and dark matter) seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the E-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generation of gravitational waves in the E-model inflation with the scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Considering a wall-crossing behavior in the moduli space, we parameterize the coupling coefficient $\xi$ as a step-like function, then if $V_{,\phi}\xi_{,\phi}&gt;0$, the Gauss-Bonnet term dominate the inflation dynamics, causing a short rapid-decline phase of the inflaton, and for appropriate parameter spaces, the mode equation of tensor perturbations develops a transient growing solution. This process generates a peak in the tensor perturbation power spectrum, corresponding to a peak in the gravitational wave energy spectrum around the nanohertz frequency band. Further more, we investigate the feasibility of generating double peaks in the gravitational wave spectrum using a double-step coupling, For certain parameter choices, one peak lies near nanohertz frequencies, while the other is around millihertz frequencies. Consequently, these gravitational waves can be observed by the pulsar timing array and the space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Probing stellar-mass primordial black holes with type Ia supernova microlensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars have served as a powerful tool for studying the composition of dark matter (DM) in lensing galaxies. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) by using the microlensing effect of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the parameters of the lensed quasar system PG 1115+80, such as convergence, shear, and stellar/dark matter fractions, we generate microlensing magnification maps. A uniform brightness disk model is applied to these maps to evaluate the microlensing amplitude at different stages of the supernova explosion. We extend this analysis by employing the strong lensing parameters derived from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to create extensive image datasets of lensed SNe Ia. Utilizing these datasets and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, we compare two models: (1) the fiducial model, where galaxies are composed of stars and smooth DM, and (2) the alternative model, where galaxies consist of stars and compact DM, specifically PBHs. Our preliminary analysis predicts that at least 60 image datasets are required to distinguish these two scenarios at a 95 percent confidence level. Additionally, by incorporating the Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs (SL-Hammocks), which provide more realistic and precise image data, we refine our prediction to assess the data requirements for distinguishing cases where PBHs constitute fractions x of the total dark matter mass. Our findings indicate that 50, 55, and 65 image datasets, corresponding to compact dark matter fractions of 100 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent (denoted by x), are necessary to distinguish between the specific models.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Imaging systematics induced by galaxy sub-sample fluctuation: new systematics at second order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging systematics refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of a galaxy sample caused by varying observing conditions and astrophysical foregrounds. Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations, caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics, cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss the estimation and mitigation of sub-sample systematics, with a combination of synthetic source injection (SSI), analytical benchmarking on SSI, and self-organizing map.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark matter freeze-in from non-equilibrium QFT: towards a consistent treatment of thermal effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermal corrections to a model of real scalar dark matter (DM) interacting feebly with a SM fermion and a gauge-charged vector-like fermion mediator. We employ the Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for our calculation and go beyond previous works by including the full dependence on the relevant mass scales as opposed to using (non)relativistic approximations. In particular, we calculate the DM production rate by employing 1PI-resummed propagators constructed from the leading order term in the loop expansion of the 2PI effective action, beyond the Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) approximation. We compare our findings to commonly used approximation schemes, including solving the Boltzmann equation using momentum-independent thermal masses in decay processes and as regulators for $t$-channel divergences. We also compare with the result when employing HTL propagators and their tree-level limit. We find that the DM relic abundance when using thermal masses in the Boltzmann approach deviates between $-10\%$ and $+30\%$ from our calculation, where the size and sign strongly depend on the mass splitting between the DM candidate and the gauge-charged mediator. The HTL-approximated result is more accurate at small gauge couplings, only deviating by a few percent at large mass splittings, whereas it overestimates the relic density up to $25\%$ for small mass splittings. Calculations using tree-level propagators in the CTP formalism or semiclassical Boltzmann equations without scatterings underestimate the dark matter abundance and can lead to deviations of up to $-100\%$ from the 1PI-resummed result.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs), second-order tensor modes sourced by first-order scalar fluctuations in General Relativity (GR), are expected to contribute to the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) potentially detectable by current and future gravitational wave interferometers. In the framework of GR, this SGWB represents an unavoidable contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum. In this paper, we go beyond GR and we investigate the behavior of SIGWs in f(R) gravity. We explore how the SIGW spectrum is influenced across a broad range of frequencies, from the nano-Hz regime, where the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) operates, through the milli-Hz band probed by the space-based LISA detector, up to the kilo-Hz frequency range, where the ground-based LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA network is currently operational. Our results indicate that the beyond-GR correction leaves an observational imprint, mainly in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, giving the possibility to use SIGW to constrain GR on scales on which we have limited information.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the Detectability of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies and Outer-Halo Star Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to faint, resolved Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters. We characterize the expected sensitivity using simulated LSST data from the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2 (DC2) accessed and analyzed with the Rubin Science Platform as part of the Rubin Early Science Program. We simulate resolved stellar populations of Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters over a wide range of sizes, luminosities, and heliocentric distances, which are broadly consistent with expectations for the Milky Way satellite system. We inject simulated stars into the DC2 catalog with realistic photometric uncertainties and star/galaxy separation derived from the DC2 data itself. We assess the probability that each simulated system would be detected by LSST using a conventional isochrone matched-filter technique. We find that assuming perfect star/galaxy separation enables the detection of resolved stellar systems with $M_V$ = 0 mag and $r_{1/2}$ = 10 pc with &gt;50% efficiency out to a heliocentric distance of ~250 kpc. Similar detection efficiency is possible with a simple star/galaxy separation criterion based on measured quantities, although the false positive rate is higher due to leakage of background galaxies into the stellar sample. When assuming perfect star/galaxy classification and a model for the galaxy-halo connection fit to current data, we predict that 89 +/- 20 Milky Way satellite galaxies will be detectable with a simple matched-filter algorithm applied to the LSST wide-fast-deep data set. Different assumptions about the performance of star/galaxy classification efficiency can decrease this estimate by ~7%-25%, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality star/galaxy separation for studies of the Milky Way satellite population with LSST.</description>

Abstract: We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities that are intermediate between those of typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z\sim5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>

      <title>Phase space and data analyses of a nonminimally coupled scalar field system with a decaying dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models nonminimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling {\xi}. We study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed descending dark energy model, namely, Q-SC-CDM. Initially, we choose distinct values of coupling parameter. For some values of {\xi}, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: decelerated expansion (early time), accelerated expansion (late-time) and slow-contraction (future era), and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. In other scenario, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, cosmic acceleration is obtained at current epoch, and the universe gets de-Sitter expansion at distant future. It is remarkable to see that the Big Crunch Singularity is redundant in the later case. Next, we investigate the phase space analysis for the model under consideration. Our investigation brings new asymptotic regimes and finds stable de-Sitter solution. Eventually, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. The results demonstrate that the present model yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic test, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM. The Statistical comparison reveals moderate support for the current model.</description>

      <title>GalaxyGenius: Mock galaxy image generator for various telescopes from hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. Its implementation will support and advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes, while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate the required mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, we created a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys, spanning ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) wavelength coverage, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research. They can also serve as training sets for relevant studies using deep learning in cases where real observational data are insufficient.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>
