      <title>Flexible Intelligent Layered Metasurfaces for Downlink Multi-user MISO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained attention as a paradigm for wave-domain signal processing with reduced reliance on costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, conventional SIMs rely on uniform inter-layer spacing and require deep stacking to ensure processing capability, resulting in severe power attenuation in practice. To address this issue, we propose a flexible intelligent layered metasurface (FILM) architecture consisting of two shape-controllable flexible metasurface layers. By replacing rigid metasurfaces with flexible ones in both layers, the transmission coefficient matrix can be dynamically adjusted, significantly decreasing the number of required layers while maintaining signal processing performance. Firstly, we develop a two-layer FILM-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system, wherein we formulate a channel fitting problem aimed at reducing the difference between the FILM-induced and target channels. Then, we solve this non-convex problem by employing an alternating optimization (AO) method, featuring closed-form phase shift updates and a gradient descent-based shape optimization. Furthermore, we analyze the upper bound on sum-rate and the complexity of computation to provide insights into design trade-offs. Finally, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed transmissive FILM architecture achieves over 200\% improvement in sum-rate and more than 7 dB bit-error rate (BER) gain compared to the conventional seven-layer SIMs.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) be an arbitrary, known matrix and \(\bm{e}\) a \(q\)-sparse adversarial vector. Given \(\bm{y} = \bm{A} x^* + \bm{e}\) and \(q\), we seek the smallest set containing \(x^*\)-hence the one conveying maximal information about \(x^*\)-that is uniformly recoverable from \(\bm{y}\) without knowing \(\bm{e}\). While exact recovery of \(x^*\) via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on \(\bm{A}\) or \(x^*\) (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary \(\bm{A}\) and \(x^*\) remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), where \(\bm{U}\) is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of \(\bm{A}\) obtained by deleting \(2q\) rows. Moreover, we prove that every \(x\) that minimizes the \(\ell\_0\)-norm of \(\bm{y} - \bm{A} x\) lies in \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>

      <title>Precoding-free Hierarchical Rate-Splitting Multiple Access via Stacked Intelligent Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference management is a central bottleneck in dense multi-antenna wireless networks. Therefore, in this study, we present a digital precoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture assisted by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral efficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity. In the proposed system, the base station performs only scalar power allocation, while a multi-layer SIM acts as a wave-domain processor that spatially separates users and mitigates interference via nonlinear wavefront reconfiguration. This design eliminates the need for digital or hybrid precoding, drastically reducing the baseband computations. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing SIM phase shifts, power allocation, and user grouping. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, combining simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for SIM configuration and power control with clustering-based grouping refinement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SIM-aided HRSMA achieves substantial gains in both spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and non-precoding baselines. Specifically, SIM-aided HRSMA attains comparable or superior minimum rates with significantly fewer active antennas by exploiting the additional wave-domain degrees of freedom provided by multi-layer SIMs. These findings highlight the potential of SIM-aided HRSMA as a low-cost, energy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming with Sensing-Assisted Discrete Phase Shifts for Dual-RIS ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeting the requirements of 6G, this paper investigates a semi-passive dual-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, tackling the max-min user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) problem via joint active and passive beamforming to enhance system performance and ensure user fairness. Addressing this challenge, we first utilize dual RISs for user angle estimation to simplify the solution process of the formulated problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is then developed. Specifically, semi-definite relaxation and the bisection method are employed to solve the transmit beamforming optimization subproblem. For the RIS discrete phase shifts, a sensing-assisted approach is adopted to constrain the optimization search space, with two distinct low-complexity search strategies introduced for different RIS sizes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves performance close to the ideal continuous phase shift benchmark, outperforms conventional discrete phase shift optimization algorithms, and exhibits a significant improvement over single-RIS systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mind World Models: A General Framework for Learning in Dynamic Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks, existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL) are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.</description>

      <title>A short survey on almost orthogonal vectors in a few specific large dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of \emph{almost orthogonal vectors}, i.e.\ vectors whose cosine similarity is close to $0$, relates to topics both in pure mathematics and in coding theory under the guises of spherical packing and spherical codes. In recent years the rise of advanced language models in AI has created new interest in this concept as the models seem to store certain concepts as almost orthogonal directions in high-dimensional spaces. In this survey we represent some ideas regarding almost orthogonal vectors through three approaches: (1) the mathematical theory of almost orthogonality, (2) some observations from the embedding spaces of language models, and (3) generation of large sets of almost orthogonal vectors by simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic RIS-Assisted THz Quantum Networks: Joint Optimization of Entanglement Generation and Fidelity under Channel Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) supported by terahertz (THz) wireless links present a transformative alternative to fiber-based infrastructures, particularly in mobile and infrastructure-scarce environments. However, signal attenuation, molecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose significant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that leverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive modes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS elements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust redirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a detailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz quantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment variations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine RIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while satisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality of service (QoS) demands. The model also includes an exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities arising from dynamic RIS switching patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture yields up to 87\% fidelity enhancement and 65\% fairness improvement compared to static RIS baselines, while maintaining robustness under realistic THz channel conditions. These results underscore the promise of dynamic RIS technology in enabling scalable and adaptive quantum communications over wireless THz links.</description>

      <title>JiuTian Chuanliu: A Large Spatiotemporal Model for General-purpose Dynamic Urban Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a window for urban sensing, human mobility contains rich spatiotemporal information that reflects both residents' behavior preferences and the functions of urban areas. The analysis of human mobility has attracted the attention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific tasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human mobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to push massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model, discover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban sensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility data is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework named General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban sensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea and contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as nodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as people-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time dynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states for both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task is specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node embeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further construct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate GDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts of data. Furthermore, our framework is used to deploy the JiuTian ChuanLiu Big Model, a system that has been presented at the 2023 China Mobile Worldwide Partner Conference.</description>

      <title>Optimal Arm Elimination Algorithms for Combinatorial Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed, active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</description>

      <title>Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop First-Order Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially, we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop, first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form $O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed SFLCB algorithm.

      <title>Rejection-Sampled Universal Quantization for Smaller Quantization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a randomized vector quantizer which has a smaller maximum error compared to all known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 5, 6, ..., 48, and also has a smaller mean squared error compared to known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 35, ..., 47, in the high resolution limit. Moreover, our randomized quantizer has a desirable property that the quantization error is always uniform over the ball and independent of the input. Our construction is based on applying rejection sampling on universal quantization, which allows us to shape the error distribution to be any continuous distribution, not only uniform distributions over basic cells of a lattice as in conventional dithered quantization. We also characterize the high SNR limit of one-shot channel simulation for any additive noise channel under a mild assumption (e.g., the AWGN channel), up to an additive constant of 1.45 bits.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Framework for Agile Resilience in Criticality-Aware Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As mission- and safety-critical wireless applications grow in complexity and diversity, next-generation wireless systems must meet increasingly stringent and multifaceted requirements. These systems demand resilience along with enhanced intelligence and adaptability to ensure reliable communication under diverse conditions. This paper proposes an event-based multi-stage resilience framework for systematically integrating complementary error mitigation techniques in wireless networks. The framework is applied to uplink transmission of mixedcriticality data under random link blockages. A key component is a novel mixed-criticality rate-splitting multiple access (MC-RSMA) scheme that combines multi- and single-connectivity to balance rate and blockage robustness. MC-RSMA is complemented by one-sided access point cooperation and central decoding, which are integrated into an event-driven algorithm. Here, increasingly effective but more complex mechanisms are activated sequentially to systematically counteract blockages while balancing resilience with cost. From a cross-layer perspective, two transmit power allocation problems are formulated: One for separate decoding and one for central decoding, to ensure fair queue utilization under heterogeneous quality-of-service requirements. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the delay performance under varying blockage durations and examine the cost tradeoffs among resilience mechanisms within the proposed framework. Results show that the proposed framework achieves resilience across disruption regimes: MC-RSMA balances efficiency and robustness as a criticality-aware core scheme, active robustness strategies handle frequent short-term fluctuations, and adaptive recovery ensures performance during rare, prolonged blockages.</description>

      <title>Coding for Strand Breaks in Composite DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their sequential nature, traditional DNA synthesis methods are expensive in terms of time and resources. They also fabricate multiple copies of the same strand, introducing redundancy. This redundancy can be leveraged to enhance the information capacity of each synthesis cycle and DNA storage systems in general by employing composite DNA symbols. Unlike conventional DNA storage, composite DNA encodes information in the distribution of bases across a pool of strands rather than in the individual strands themselves. Consequently, error models for DNA storage must be adapted to account for this unique characteristic. One significant error model for long-term DNA storage is strand breaks, often caused by the decay of individual bases. This work extends the strand-break channel model to the composite DNA setting. To address this challenge, we propose a coding scheme that uses marker codes to correct single strand breaks. As part of this approach, we generalise run-length-limited (RLL) codes for the composite setting and derive bounds on their redundancy.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings $(a, b, c)$, there exists a string $z$ such that each conditional Kolmogorov complexity $C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)$ is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We give a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple $(a, b, c)$ for which no such string $z$ exists. Moreover, we construct a fully explicit example of such a tuple. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on bounds for point-line incidences over prime fields. As an application, we show that this impossibility yields lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in information-theoretic behavior between fields with and without proper subfields.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality increase for error correction in the interaction between information space and the physical world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of human intelligence led to the huge amount of data in the information space. Accessing and processing this data helps in finding solutions to applied problems based on finite-dimensional models. We argue, that formally, such a mathematical model can be embedded into a higher-dimensional model inside of which a desired solution will exist. In our model, the physical world and the information space are submanifolds of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and the processes, including information transmission, are maps between the submanifolds of the physical world or of the information space. We discuss how our perspective fits in the context of existing literature. Our theorem states that a submanifold in the parameter space of the physical world can be deformed to a target submanifold outside that space, with an appropriate count of the deformation parameters. We interpret this assertion as an existence result for a class of problems and we discuss further steps.</description>

      <title>Auto-Calibration and Biconvex Compressive Sensing with Applications to Parallel MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an auto-calibration problem in which a transform-sparse signal is acquired via compressive sensing by multiple sensors in parallel, but with unknown calibration parameters of the sensors. This inverse problem has an important application in pMRI reconstruction, where the calibration parameters of the receiver coils are often difficult and costly to obtain explicitly, but nonetheless are a fundamental requirement for high-precision reconstructions. Most auto-calibration strategies for this problem involve solving a challenging biconvex optimization problem, which lacks reconstruction guarantees. In this work, we transform the auto-calibrated parallel compressive sensing problem to a convex optimization problem using the idea of `lifting'. By exploiting sparsity structures in the signal and the redundancy introduced by multiple sensors, we solve a mixed-norm minimization problem to recover the underlying signal and the sensing parameters simultaneously. Our method provides robust and stable recovery guarantees that take into account the presence of noise and sparsity deficiencies in the signals. As such, it offers a theoretically guaranteed approach to auto-calibrated parallel imaging in MRI under appropriate assumptions. Applications in compressive sensing pMRI are discussed, and numerical experiments using real and simulated MRI data are presented to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Linear regression with overparameterized linear neural networks: Tight upper and lower bounds for implicit $\ell^1$-regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained in a setting where the number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples. To understand the implicit bias of gradient descent in such overparameterized models, prior work has studied diagonal linear neural networks in the regression setting. These studies have shown that, when initialized with small weights, gradient descent tends to favor solutions with minimal $\ell^1$-norm - an effect known as implicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate implicit regularization in diagonal linear neural networks of depth $D\ge 2$ for overparameterized linear regression problems. We focus on analyzing the approximation error between the limit point of gradient flow trajectories and the solution to the $\ell^1$-minimization problem. By deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the approximation error, we precisely characterize how the approximation error depends on the scale of initialization $\alpha$. Our results reveal a qualitative difference between depths: for $D \ge 3$, the error decreases linearly with $\alpha$, whereas for $D=2$, it decreases at rate $\alpha^{1-\varrho}$, where the parameter $\varrho \in [0,1)$ can be explicitly characterized. Interestingly, this parameter is closely linked to so-called null space property constants studied in the sparse recovery literature. We demonstrate the asymptotic tightness of our bounds through explicit examples. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest that deeper networks, i.e., $D \ge 3$, may lead to better generalization, particularly for realistic initialization scales.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Data Memorization via Strong Data Processing Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning. In this work, we develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the number of samples available to a learning algorithm, and the amount of information about the training data that a learning algorithm needs to memorize to be accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information about the training data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples are available, which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific rate. Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors) by simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general mixture-of-clusters models. Our definitions and results build on the work of Brown et al. (2021) and address several limitations of the lower bounds in their work.</description>

      <title>GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Quantum capacity amplification via privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open.</description>
