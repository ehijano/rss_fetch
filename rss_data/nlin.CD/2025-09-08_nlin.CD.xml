      <title>Examining the evolution of phase-space elements for $\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\textit{Caenorhabditis Elegans}$ ($\textit{C.elegans}$) nematodes have long been a model organism for quantitative behavioral analysis, due to their tractable nervous system and well-characterized genetics. In particular, dynamic diffraction has been a successful method of studying said microorganisms due to its low level of noise and the ability to simultaneously study multiple degrees of freedom of their neuromuscular system through their locomotion. In this study, we estimate the Lyapunov spectrum of $\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion, which offers an insight into how volume elements evolve in the phase space of the underlying dynamical system. For that, we used the Sano-Sawada algorithm to estimate the spectra from the trajectories reconstructed using the Takens embedding procedure. In total, two positive and one negative exponents were calculated and verified to be non-spurious through investigations of their stability for different sets of parameters. Those exponents have values of $0.860 \pm 0.028$, $0.389 \pm 0.014$, and $-3.451 \pm 0.074$ respectively. The presence of two positive exponents indicates that $\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion is hyperchaotic, while the total sum being negative indicates that the system is dissipative and non-Hamiltonian. Those are key observations for the underlying system and will be significant for the potential creation of future mathematical or computational models.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Fractal Geometry in Ring Lattice Systems of Nonchaotic Rulkov Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that arise in a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. While networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons have been widely studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. Here, we find that rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular-spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. By systematically varying the electrical coupling strength between neurons, we also uncover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across the system's dynamical regimes. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find that these attractors can occupy as many as 45 of the 60 dimensions of state space. We further explore how variations in chaotic behavior - quantified by the full Lyapunov spectra - correspond to changes in the attractors' fractal dimensions. This analysis advances our understanding of how complex collective behavior can emerge from the interaction of multiple simple neuron models and highlights the deep interplay between dynamics and geometry in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>
