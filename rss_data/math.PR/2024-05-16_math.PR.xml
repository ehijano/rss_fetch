      <title>Infinite differentiability of the free energy for a Derrida-Retaux system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recursive system which was introduced by Derrida and Retaux (J. Stat. Phys. ${\bf 156}$ (2014) 268-290) as a toy model to study the depinning transition in presence of disorder. Derrida and Retaux predicted the free energy $F_\infty(p)$ of the system exhibit quite an unusual physical phenomenon which is an infinite order phase transition. Hu and Shi (J. Stat. Phys. ${\bf 172}$ (2018) 718-741) studied a special situation and obtained other behavior of the free energy, while insisted on $p=p_c$ being an essential singularity. Recently, Chen, Dagard, Derrida, Hu, Lifshits and Shi (Ann. Probab. ${\bf 49}$ (2021) 637-670) confirmed the Derrida-Retaux conjecture under suitable integrability condition. However, in the mathematical review, it is still unknown whether the free energy is infinitely differentiable at the critical point. So that, we continue to study the infinite differentiability of the free energy in this paper.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of some stochastic Fokker-Planck equations with additive common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider stochastic Fokker-Planck Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), obtained as the mean-field limit of weakly interacting particle systems subjected to both independent (or idiosyncratic) and common Brownian noises. We provide sufficient conditions under which the deterministic counterpart of the Fokker-Planck equation, which corresponds to particle systems that are just subjected to independent noises, has several invariant measures, but for which the stochastic version admits a unique invariant measure under the presence of the additive common noise. The very difficulty comes from the fact that the common noise is just of finite dimension while the state variable, which should be seen as the conditional marginal law of the system given the common noise, lives in a space of infinite dimension. In this context, our result holds true if, in addition to standard confining properties, the mean field interaction term forces the system to be attracted by its conditional mean given the common noise and the intensity of the idiosyncratic noise is small.</description>

      <title>Tempered Fractional Hawkes Process and Its Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawkes process (HP) is a point process with a conditionally dependent intensity function. This paper defines the tempered fractional Hawkes process (TFHP) by time-changing the HP with an inverse tempered stable subordinator. We obtained results that generalize the fractional Hawkes process defined in Hainaut (2020) to a tempered version which has \textit{semi-heavy tailed} decay. We derive the mean, the variance, covariance and the governing fractional difference-differential equations of the TFHP. Additionally, we introduce the generalized fractional Hawkes process (GFHP) by time-changing the HP with the inverse L\'evy subordinator. This definition encompasses all potential (inverse L\'evy) time changes as specific instances. We also explore the distributional characteristics and the governing difference-differential equation of the one-dimensional distribution for the GFHP.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior and optimal control of a stochastic SAIRS epidemic model with two saturated incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models are widely used to investigate the spread of epidemics in a complex environment. This paper extends a deterministic SAIRS epidemic model to a stochastic case with limited patient capacity and exposure. We first study the dynamical properties of the model under certain conditions, including persistence, extinction, and ergodic. Then, we introduce vaccination and isolation into the model as control variables. The optimal control strategies are obtained based on the Pontryagin minimum principle. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Convergence of kinetic Langevin samplers for non-convex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three kinetic Langevin samplers including the Euler discretization, the BU and the UBU splitting scheme. We provide contraction results in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for non-convex potentials. These results are based on a carefully tailored distance function and an appropriate coupling construction. Additionally, the error in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance between the true target measure and the invariant measure of the discretization scheme is bounded. To get an $\varepsilon$-accuracy in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, we show complexity guarantees of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ for the Euler scheme and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for the UBU scheme under appropriate regularity assumptions on the target measure. The results are applicable to interacting particle systems and provide bounds for sampling probability measures of mean-field type.</description>

      <title>Analysis of singularly perturbed stochastic chemical reaction networks motivated by applications to epigenetic cell memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epigenetic cell memory, the inheritance of gene expression patterns across subsequent cell divisions, is a critical property of multi-cellular organisms. In recent work [10], a subset of the authors observed in a simulation study how the stochastic dynamics and time-scale differences between establishment and erasure processes in chromatin modifications (such as histone modifications and DNA methylation) can have a critical effect on epigenetic cell memory. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework to rigorously validate and extend beyond these computational findings. Viewing our stochastic model of a chromatin modification circuit as a singularly perturbed, finite state, continuous time Markov chain, we extend beyond existing theory in order to characterize the leading coefficients in the series expansions of stationary distributions and mean first passage times. In particular, we characterize the limiting stationary distribution in terms of a reduced Markov chain, provide an algorithm to determine the orders of the poles of mean first passage times, and determine how changing erasure rates affects system behavior. The theoretical tools developed in this paper not only allow us to set a rigorous mathematical basis for the computational findings of our prior work, highlighting the effect of chromatin modification dynamics on epigenetic cell memory, but they can also be applied to other singularly perturbed Markov chains beyond the applications in this paper, especially those associated with chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>The Lamperti transformation in the infinite-dimensional setting and the genealogies of self-similar Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a change in focus from the prevalent paradigm based on the branching property as a tool to analyze the structure of population models, to one based on the self-similarity property, which we also introduce for the first time in the setting of measure-valued processes. By extending the well-known Lamperti transformation for self-similar Markov processes to the Banach-valued case we are able to generalize celebrated results in population genetics that describe the frequency-process of measure-valued stable branching processes in terms of the subfamily of Beta-Fleming-Viot processes. In our work we describe the frequency process of populations whose total size evolves as any positive self-similar Markov process in terms of general $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes. Our results demonstrate the potential power of the self-similar perspective for the study of population models in which the reproduction dynamics of the individuals depend on the total population size, allowing for more complex and realistic models.</description>

      <title>On Long Range Ising Models with Random Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polynomial long-range Ising models in one dimension, with ferromagnetic pair interactions decaying with power $2-\alpha$ (for $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$), and prepared with randomly chosen boundary conditions. We show that at low temperatures in the thermodynamic limit the finite-volume Gibbs measures do not converge, but have a distributional limit, the so-called metastate. We find that there is a distinction between the values of $\alpha$ less than or larger than $\frac{1}{2}$. For moderate, or intermediate, decay $\alpha &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, the metastate is very dispersed and supported on the set of all Gibbs measures, both extremal and non-extremal, whereas for slow decays $\alpha &gt; \frac{1}{2}$ the metastate is still dispersed, but has its support just on the set of the two extremal Gibbs measures, the plus measure and the minus measure.
  The former, moderate decays case, appears to be new and is due to the occurrence of almost sure boundedness of the random variable which is the sum of all interaction (free) energies between random and ordered half-lines, when the decay is fast enough, but still slow enough to get a phase transition ($\alpha&gt;0$); while the latter, slow decays case, is more reminiscent of and similar to the behaviour of higher-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising models with diverging boundary (free) energies.
  We leave the threshold case $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ for further studies.</description>

      <title>Random ReLU Neural Networks as Non-Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a large class of shallow neural networks with randomly initialized parameters and rectified linear unit activation functions. We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent $3/2$. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).</description>

      <title>A systematic path to non-Markovian dynamics II: Probabilistic response of nonlinear multidimensional systems to Gaussian colored noise excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the variational problem associated with the Freidlin--Wentzell Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE). For a general class of initial-terminal conditions, we show that a minimizer of this variational problem exists, and any minimizer solves a system of imaginary-time Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This system is integrable. Utilizing the integrability, we prove that the formulas from the physics work Krajenbrink and Le Doussal (2021) hold for every minimizer of the variational problem. As an application, we consider the Freidlin--Wentzell LDP for the SHE with the delta initial condition. Under a technical assumption on the poles of the reflection coefficients, we prove the explicit expression for the one-point rate function that was predicted in the physics works Le Doussal, Majumdar, Rosso, and Schehr (2016) and Krajenbrink and Le Doussal (2021). Under the same assumption, we give detailed pointwise estimates of the most probable shape in the upper-tail limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the L\'evy process time-changed by independent L\'evy subordinators, namely, the incomplete gamma subordinator, the $\epsilon$-jumps incomplete gamma subordinator and tempered incomplete gamma subordinator. We derive their important distributional properties such as mean, variance, correlation, tail probabilities and fractional moments. The long-range dependence property of these processes are discussed. An application in insurance domain is studied in detail. Finally, we present the simulated sample paths for the subordinators.</description>

      <title>Metastable hierarchy in abstract low-temperature lattice models: an application to Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macroscopic number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we study the hierarchical phenomenon of metastability in low-temperature lattice models in the most general setting. Given an abstract dynamical system governed by a Hamiltonian function, we prove that there exists a hierarchical decomposition of the collection of stable plateaux in the system into multiple $\mathfrak{m}$ levels, such that at each level there exist tunneling metastable transitions between the stable plateaux, which can be characterized by convergence to a simple Markov chain as the inverse temperature $\beta$ tends to infinity. In the second part, as an application, we characterize the $3$-level metastable hierarchy in Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macroscopic number of particles. We prove that the ground states in this model are those in which the particles line up and form a one-dimensional strip, and identify the full structure relevant to the tunneling transitions between these ground states. In particular, the results differ from the previous work [5] in that the particles in the ground states are likely to form a strip rather than a square droplet. The main tool is the resolvent approach to metastability, recently developed in [24]. Along with the analysis, we present a theorem on the sharp asymptotics of the exit distribution from cycles, which to the author's knowledge is not known in the community and therefore may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Particle method and quantization-based schemes for the simulation of the McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three numerical schemes for the McKean-Vlasov equation \[\begin{cases} \;dX_t=b(t, X_t, \mu_t) \, dt+\sigma(t, X_t, \mu_t) \, dB_t,\: \\ \;\forall\, t\in[0,T],\;\mu_t \text{ is the probability distribution of }X_t, \end{cases}\] where $X_0$ is a known random variable. Under the assumption on the Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients $b$ and $\sigma$, our first result proves the convergence rate of the particle method with respect to the Wasserstein distance, which extends a previous work [BT97] established in one-dimensional setting. In the second part, we present and analyse two quantization-based schemes, including the recursive quantization scheme (deterministic scheme) in the Vlasov setting, and the hybrid particle-quantization scheme (random scheme, inspired by the $K$-means clustering). Two examples are simulated at the end of this paper: Burger's equation and the network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons in dimension 3.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns a local volatility model in which volatility takes two possible values, and the specific value depends on whether the underlying price is above or below a given threshold value. The model is known, and a number of results have been obtained for it. In particular, option pricing formulas and a power law behaviour of the implied volatility skew have been established in the case when the threshold is taken at the money. In this paper we derive an alternative representation of option pricing formulas. In addition, we obtain an approximation of option prices by the corresponding Black-Scholes prices. Using this approximation streamlines obtaining the aforementioned behaviour of the skew. Our approach is based on the natural relationship of the model with Skew Brownian motion and consists of the systematic use of the joint distribution of this stochastic process and some of its functionals.</description>
