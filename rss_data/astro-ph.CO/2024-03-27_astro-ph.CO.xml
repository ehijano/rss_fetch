      <title>Diffuse radio emission from merger shocks in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally-bound structures in the Universe. As such, during merger events with similar systems, they release an enormous amount of energy that is dissipated through the formation of shock waves and turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), the hot ionised plasma permeating the cluster volume. These shock waves are believed to be ideal sites for electron acceleration that, in the presence of ubiquitous magnetic fields in the ICM, are capable of producing elongated non-thermal radio features typically observed in the outskirts of dynamically disturbed clusters, also known as radio relics. In this work, we analyse a hydrodynamical re-simulation of merging galaxy clusters, extracted from a large set of zoom-in cosmological simulations of The Three Hundred Project, to study the evolution and diversity of merger shocks and their associated diffuse radio emission within the framework of the diffusive shock acceleration scenario.</description>

      <title>Planck data revisited: low-noise synchrotron polarisation maps from the WMAP and Planck space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of cosmic microwave background polarisation, essential for probing a potential phase of inflation in the early universe, suffer from contamination by polarised emission from the Galactic interstellar medium. This work combines existing observations from the WMAP and Planck space missions to make a low-noise map of polarised synchrotron emission that can be used to clean forthcoming CMB observations. We combine WMAP K, Ka and Q maps with Planck LFI 30~GHz and 44~GHz maps using weights that near-optimally combine the observations as a function of sky direction, angular scale, and polarisation orientation. We publish well-characterised maps of synchrotron Q and U Stokes parameters at nu = 30GHz and 1 degree angular resolution. A statistical description of uncertainties is provided with Monte-Carlo simulations of additive and multiplicative errors. Our maps are the most sensitive full-sky maps of synchrotron polarisation to date, and are made available to the scientific community on a dedicated web site.</description>

      <title>Developing a Theoretical Model for the Resummation of Infrared Effects in the Pre- and Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Bispectra (https://youtu.be/bHdlIi3jQ4A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While substantial progress has been made in studying the pre-reconstruction galaxy bispectrum, investigations of the post-reconstruction bispectrum are still in nascent stages. In this paper, we present a bispectrum model that incorporates one-loop corrections in the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), while simultaneously addressing infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction density fluctuations in a non-perturbative approach. This model accurately captures the nonlinear behavior of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal within the post-reconstruction bispectrum framework. Furthermore, the incorporation of the one-loop correction extends its applicability to smaller scales. Given that the approach to addressing IR effects remains invariant before and after the reconstruction process, the resulting IR-resummed bispectrum model exhibits uniformity across both scenarios. Throughout this analysis, we achieve a comprehensive and unified description of the bispectrum that seamlessly spans the pre- and post-reconstruction phases.

      <title>The effect of Relativistic Aberration on Cosmological Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: we propose that the condition of relative motion between us and the objects that we observe in the Universe should generate relativistic aberration on the photons that such objects emit, varying the observed flux similarly to the cases of blazars and neutron stars, with instead a decrease of this radiative flux. Methods: we follow some important papers and textbook used in modern cosmology, adding the effects of relativistic aberration in the theoretical description of the Cosmos. Results: New definitions for the luminosity distance and the angular distance arise, with the consequence of changing the cosmological parameters measured in the last years. A qualitative description of all of this is also performed on the multipole analysis of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Can the splashback radius be an observable boundary of galaxy clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splashback radius was proposed as a physically motivated boundary of clusters as it sets the limit between the infalling and the orbitally dominated regions. However, galaxy clusters are complex objects connected to filaments of the cosmic web from which they accrete matter that disturbs them and modifies their morphology. In this context, estimating the splashback radius and the cluster boundary becomes challenging. In this work, we use a constrained hydrodynamical simulation of the Virgo cluster's replica embedded in its large-scale structure to investigate the impact of its local environment on the splashback radius estimate. We identify the splashback radius from 3D radial profiles of dark matter density, baryons density, and pressure in three regions representative of different dynamical states: accretion from spherical collapse, filaments, and matter outflow. We also identify the splashback radius from 2D-projected radial profiles of observation-like quantities: mass surface density, emission measure, and Compton-y. We show that the splashback radius mainly depends on the dynamics in each region and the physical processes traced by the different probes. We find multiple values for the splashback radius ranging from 3.3$\pm$0.2 to 5.5$\pm$0.3 Mpc. Particularly, in the regions of collapsing and outflowing material, the splashback radii estimated from baryon density and pressure radial profiles overestimate that of the dark matter density profiles, which is considered the reference value originally defined from dark matter simulations. Consequently, caution is required when using the splashback radius as a boundary of clusters, particularly in the case of highly disturbed clusters like Virgo. We also discuss the detection of the splashback radius from pressure radial profiles, which could be more related to an accretion shock, and its detection from stacked radial profiles.</description>

      <title>Late-forming black holes and the antiproton, gamma-ray, and anti-helium excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes long-lived enough to be the dark matter have temperatures below the MeV. Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here, we show that such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the Large Scale Structures of the Universe as a Phenomenology of a Fractal Turbulence: The Role of the Plasma Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the symmetries that govern the formation of large-scale structures across the Universe, particularly focusing on the transition from the seeds of galaxy clusters to the seeds of galaxies themselves. We address two main features of cosmological fluid dynamics pertaining to both the linear and non-linear regimes. The linear dynamics of cosmological perturbations within the Hubble horizon is characterized by the Jeans length, which separates stable configurations from unstable fluctuations due to the gravitational effect on sufficiently large (and therefore, massive enough) overdensities. On the other hand, the non-linear dynamics of the cosmological fluid is associated with a turbulent behavior once the Reynolds numbers reach a sufficiently high level. This turbulent regime leads to energy dissipation across smaller and smaller scales, resulting in a fractal distribution of eddies throughout physical space. The proposed scenario suggests that the spatial scale of eddy formation is associated with the Jeans length of various levels of fragmentation from an original large-scale structure. By focusing on the fragmentation of galaxy cluster seeds versus galaxy seeds, we arrived at a phenomenological law that links the ratio of the two structure densities to the number of galaxies in each cluster and to the Hausdorff number of the Universe matter distribution. Finally, we introduced a primordial magnetic field and studied its influence on the Jeans length dynamics. The resulting anisotropic behavior of the density contrast led us to infer that the main features of the turbulence could be reduced to a 2D Euler equation. Numerical simulations showed that the two lowest wavenumbers contained the major energy contribution of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity from the large scale structure two-point and three-point correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys of cosmological large-scale structure (LSS) are sensitive to the presence of local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), and may be used to constrain models of inflation. Local PNG, characterized by fNL, the amplitude of the quadratic correction to the potential of a Gaussian random field, is traditionally measured from LSS two-point and three-point clustering via the power spectrum and bi-spectrum. We propose a framework to measure fNL using the configuration space two-point correlation function (2pcf) monopole and three-point correlation function (3pcf) monopole of survey tracers. Our model estimates the effect of the scale-dependent bias induced by the presence of PNG on the 2pcf and 3pcf from the clustering of simulated dark matter halos. We describe how this effect may be scaled to an arbitrary tracer of the cosmological matter density. The 2pcf and 3pcf of this tracer are measured to constrain the value of fNL. Using simulations of luminous red galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we demonstrate the accuracy and constraining power of our model, and forecast the ability to constrainfNL to a precision of sigma(fNL) = 22 with one year of DESI survey data.</description>

      <title>The Relevance of Dynamical Friction for the MW/LMC/SMC Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of structure formation in the standard cold dark matter cosmological model quantify the dark matter halos of galaxies. Taking into account dynamical friction between the dark matter halos, we investigate the past orbital dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds in the presence of the Galaxy. Our calculations are based on a three-body model of rigid Navarro-Frenk-White profiles for the dark matter halos, but were verified in a previous publication by comparison to high-resolution N-body simulations of live self-consistent systems. Under the requirement that the LMC and SMC had an encounter within 20 kpc between 1 and 4 Gyr ago, in order to allow the development of the Magellanic Stream, and using the latest astrometric data, the dynamical evolution of the MW/LMC/SMC system is calculated backwards in time. With the employment of the genetic algorithm and a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method, the present state of this system is unlikely with a probability of &lt;10^{-9} (6 sigma complement), because solutions found do not fit into the error bars for the observed plane-of-sky velocity components of the Magellanic Clouds. This implies that orbital solutions that assume dark matter halos according to cosmological structure formation theory to exist around the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way are not possible with a confidence of more than 6 sigma</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type are shown to admit an explicit UV completion in a QCD-like theory with a Planckian confining scale. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly interacting massive particles, which may aggregate into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies, forming dense spikes. Employing Schwarzschild geometry, we assess the density and velocity distribution of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in the density profile of DM and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes. Our findings uncover phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing significant insights for the GW-based detection of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>The SZ effect with anisotropic distributions and high energy electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect promise ever improving measurements in terms of both sensitivity and angular resolution. As such, it is increasingly relevant to model `higher-order' contributions to the SZ effect. This work examines the effects of high-energy non-thermal electron distributions and those of anisotropic electron and photon distributions on the SZ signals. Analytic forms of the anisotropic scattering kernels for photons and electrons have been derived and investigated. We present a method for determining the anisotropic contributions through a spherical harmonic decomposition to arbitrary angular multipoles, and discuss the behaviour of these scattering kernels. We then carry out an exploration of various simplistic models of high energy non-thermal electron distributions, and examine their anisotropic behaviour. The kinematic SZ in the relativistic regime is studied using the kernel formulation allowing us to clarifying the role of kinematic corrections to the scattering optical depth. We finally present a release of an updated and refined version of SZpack including a new integrated Python interface and new modules for the calculation of various SZ signals, including those described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

Abstract: Analyses of upcoming galaxy surveys will require careful modelling of relevant observables such as the power spectrum of galaxy counts in harmonic space $C_\ell(z,z')$. We investigate the impact of disregarding relevant relativistic effects by considering a model of dark energy including constant sound speed $c_{\rm eff}^2$, constant equation of state $w$, and anisotropic stress sourced by matter perturbations $\pi$. Cosmological constraints were computed using cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae type Ia, and redshift space distortions. Our results are consistent with $w=-1$, $c_{\rm eff}^2=1$, and $\pi=0$. Then, a forecast for the performance of an Euclid-like galaxy survey was carried out also adding information from other probes. Here we show that, regardless of the galaxy survey configuration, neglecting the effect of lensing convergence will lead to substantial shifts in the galaxy bias $b_0$ and the neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. Shifts in the dark energy sound speed and anisotropic stress also appear, but they depend on the survey configuration and hence lack robustness. While neglecting lensing convergence also leads to a Hubble constant $H_0$ moving downwards, the significance of the shift is not big enough to play a relevant part in the current $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Affleck-Dine mechanism for primordial black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a primordial black hole (PBH) formation scenario based on the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism and investigate two PBH mass regions: $M \sim 30 M_\odot$ motivated by the LIGO-Virgo observations of the binary black hole mergers and $M \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ motivated by the observations of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. In the previous studies, it has been considered that the inhomogeneous AD baryogenesis generates regions with a large baryon asymmetry, some of which collapse into PBHs. In this paper, we show that this scenario is severely constrained due to the baryon asymmetry remaining outside PBHs, which would spoil the success of the big bang nucleosynthesis. Then, we propose an alternative scenario where the AD leptogenesis results in the inhomogeneous formation of Q-balls with lepton charges, which collapse into PBHs. As a result, we find that our scenario can explain the favorable PBH abundance without conflicting with the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the spectral excess in DAMIC at SNOLAB with skipper CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a 3.25 kg-day target exposure of two silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), each with 24 megapixels and skipper readout, deployed in the DAMIC setup at SNOLAB. With a reduction in pixel readout noise of a factor of 10 relative to the previous detector, we investigate the excess population of low-energy events in the CCD bulk previously observed above expected backgrounds. We address the dominant systematic uncertainty of the previous analysis through a depth fiducialization designed to reject surface backgrounds on the CCDs. The measured bulk ionization spectrum confirms the presence of an excess population of low-energy events in the CCD target with characteristic rate of ${\sim}7$ events per kg-day and electron-equivalent energies of ${\sim}80~$eV, whose origin remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Discreteness effects in $N$-body simulations of warm dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmological $N$-body simulations of warm dark matter, thermal velocities of dark-matter particles are sometimes taken into account by adding random initial velocities to the particles of simulation. However, a particle in the $N$-body system represents a huge collection of dark-matter particles, whose average thermal velocity is very close to zero. We consider justification of the procedure of adding thermal velocities in $N$-body simulations and build a simple model of their influence on the power spectrum. Our model captures the physical effect of suppression of the power spectrum at small wave numbers and also explains its artificial enhancement at large wave numbers, observed in numerical simulations with added thermal velocities. The cause of this enhancement is the disturbance of the growth rate of the density profile introduced when adding random initial thermal velocities. Specifically, the model predicts a turnover in the behavior of the simulated power spectrum at a certain wave number $k_*$, beyond which it grows as $P (k) \propto k^2$. Our treatment is generalized to a system consisting of several matter components with different thermal velocity dispersion. We also estimate the effects of discreteness related to the bulk velocity field and establish the conditions under which these effects dominate over those of thermal velocities.</description>

      <title>The morphology of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial fluctuations in the tomographic maps of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) crucially depend on the size and distribution of the regions with gas temperatures larger than the radio background temperature. In this article, we study the morphological characteristics of such emission regions and their absorption counterparts using the shape diagnostic tool SURFGEN2. Using simulated CD brightness temperature cubes of the 21-cm signal, we find that the emission regions percolate at stages with the filling factor of the emission regions $FF_{\rm emi}\gtrsim 0.15$. Percolation of the absorption regions occurs for $FF_{\rm abs}\gtrsim 0.05$. The largest emission and absorption regions are topologically complex and highly filamentary for most parts of the CD. The number density of these regions as a function of the volume shows the power-law nature with the power-law indexes $\approx -2$ and $-1.6$ for the emission and absorption regions, respectively. Overall, the planarity, filamentarity and genus increase with the increase of the volume of both emission and absorption regions.</description>

      <title>The DAMIC excess from WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two dark matter searches performed with charge-coupled devices (CCDs) in the DAMIC cryostat at SNOLAB reported with high statistical significance the presence of an unidentified source of low-energy events in bulk silicon. The observed spectrum is consistent with nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with masses between 2 and 4 GeV. In the standard scenario of spin-independent WIMP-nucleus scattering, the derived cross section is conclusively excluded by results in argon by the DarkSide-50 experiment. We identify isospin-violating and spin-dependent scenarios where interactions with $^{40}$Ar are strongly suppressed and the interpretation of the DAMIC excess as WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering remains viable.</description>

      <title>The origin of supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>candl: Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis with a Differentiable Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present candl, an automatically differentiable python likelihood for analysing cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum measurements. candl is powered by JAX, which makes it fast and easy to calculate derivatives of the likelihood. This facilitates, for example, robust Fisher matrices without finite-difference methods. We show the benefits of candl through a series of example calculations, covering forecasting, robustness tests, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. These also include optimising the band power bin width to minimise parameter errors of a realistic mock data set. Moreover, we calculate the correlation of parameter constraints from correlated and partially overlapping subsets of the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data release. In a traditional analysis framework, these tasks are slow and require careful fine-tuning to obtain stable results. As such, a fully differentiable pipeline allows for a higher level of scrutiny; we argue that this is the paradigm shift required to leverage incoming data from ground-based experiments, which will significantly improve the cosmological parameter constraints from the Planck mission. candl comes with the latest primary and lensing power spectrum data from the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaborations and will be used as part of the upcoming SPT-3G $TT/TE/EE$ and $\phi\phi$ data releases. Along with the core code, we release a series of auxiliary tools, which simplify common analysis tasks and interface the likelihood with other cosmological software. candl is pip-installable and publicly available at https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl .</description>

Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>

      <title>Betti Functionals as a Probe for Cosmic Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of the global topology of the Universe (cosmic topology) is still open. In the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model it is assumed that the space of the Universe possesses the trivial topology of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and thus that the Universe has an infinite volume. As an alternative, we study in this paper one of the simplest non-trivial topologies given by a cubic 3-torus describing a universe with a finite volume. To probe cosmic topology, we analyse certain structure properties in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using Betti Functionals and the Euler Characteristic evaluated on excursions sets, which possess a simple geometrical interpretation. Since the CMB temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ are observed on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ surrounding the observer, there are only three Betti functionals $\beta_k(\nu)$, $k=1,2,3$. Here $\nu=\delta T/\sigma_0$ denotes the temperature threshold normalized by the standard deviation $\sigma_0$ of $\delta T$. Analytic approximations of the Gaussian expectations for the Betti functionals and an exact formula for the Euler characteristic are given. It is shown that the amplitudes of $\beta_0(\nu)$ and $\beta_1(\nu)$ decrease with increasing volume $V=L^3$ of the cubic 3-torus universe. Since the computation of the $\beta_k$'s from observational sky maps is hindered due to the presence of masks, we suggest a method yielding lower and upper bounds for them and apply it to four Planck 2018 sky maps. It is found that the $\beta_k$'s of the Planck maps lie between those of the torus universes with side-lengths $L=2.0$ and $L=3.0$ in units of the Hubble length and above the infinite $\Lambda$CDM case. These results give a further hint that the Universe has a non-trivial topology.</description>

      <title>Bouncing and collapsing universes dual to late-time cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Jordan frame-Einstein frame correspondence to explore dual universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the mapping between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe describes the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by dark energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the $\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, i.e., a bounce or a collapse. The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field determines whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the Jordan frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to alternative descriptions of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universes in the Jordan frame. Therefore,the effect of dark energy can equivalently be seen as collapse of space in a conformally connected universe. We further study the stability of such conformal maps against linear perturbations. The effective bouncing and collapsing descriptions of the current accelerating universe may have interesting implications for the evolutions of perturbations and quantum fluctuations in the cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Probing high scale seesaw and PBH generated dark matter via gravitational waves with multiple tilts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario where a high scale seesaw origin of light neutrino mass and gravitational dark matter (DM) in MeV-TeV ballpark originating from primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation can be simultaneously probed by future observations of stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background with multiple tilts or spectral breaks. A high scale breaking of an Abelian gauge symmetry ensures the dynamical origin of the seesaw scale while also leading to the formation of cosmic strings responsible for generating stochastic GW background. The requirement of a correct DM relic in this ballpark necessitates the inclusion of a diluter as PBH typically leads to DM overproduction. This leads to a second early matter dominated epoch after PBH evaporation due to the long-lived diluter. These two early matter dominated epochs, crucially connected to the DM relic, lead to multiple spectral breaks in the otherwise scale-invariant GW spectrum formed by cosmic strings. We find interesting correlations between DM mass and turning point frequencies of GW spectrum which are within reach of several near future experiments like LISA, BBO, ET, CE, etc.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Interpreting the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set as Early Universe Gravitational Waves Produced by ALP Induced Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a possible early universe source for the recent observation of a stochastic gravitational wave background at the NANOGrav pulsar timing array. The source is a tachyonic instability in a dark gauge field induced by an axion-like particle (ALP), a known source for gravitational waves. We find that relative to the previous analysis with the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, the current 15-year data set favors parameter space with a relatively larger axion mass and decay constant. This favored parameter space is heavily constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and overproduction of ALP dark matter. While there are potential mechanisms for avoiding the second problem, evading the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint remains highly challenging. In particular, we find that the gravitational wave magnitude is significantly suppressed with respect to the gauge boson dark radiation, which implies that successfully explaining the NANOGrav observation requires a large additional dark radiation, violating the cosmological constraints. Satisfying the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint will limit the potential contribution from this mechanism to the observed signal to at most a percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the leptonic ALP portal as a simple scenario that connects observed discrepancies in anomalous magnetic moments to the Dark Matter relic abundance. In this framework an axion-like particle in the multi-MeV range couples to SM leptons and a DM fermion, with mass above the ALP mass but below a GeV. The ALP contributes to $(g-2)_\mu$ and $(g-2)_e$ dominantly through 2-loop Barr-Zee diagrams, while the DM abundance is generated by $p$-wave annihilation to ALP pairs. Constraints from beam-dump experiments, colliders and CMB probes are very stringent, and restrict the viable parameter space to a rather narrow region that will be tested in the near future.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Solar Chameleons in the Earth's Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chameleon dark energy models are a popular alternative to the standard cosmological constant model. These models consist of a new light degree of freedom, called chameleon, with a density dependent mass and a non-trivial coupling to both matter and photons. Owing to these couplings, chameleons can be produced inside the sun. However due to their density dependent mass, the chameleons produced in the solar core are screened and cannot escape whereas those produced outside the solar core, such as in the \textit{tachocline} region with energies of the order of few a keV, can escape from the sun and travel all the way towards Earth. Hence the Earth is expected to receive a flux of \textit{solar chameleons}. In this work we propose a \textit{light shining through wall} (LSW) type of experiment in which the Earth itself acts as a wall. Both photons and chameleons are incident on the light side of the Earth. While all the photons are stopped by the Earth, only a fraction of the chameleons are stopped by the earth due to screening. Those chameleons which are not screened by the earth pass directly through the Earth and exit the night side. Here these chameleons interact with the geomagnetic field and convert into X-ray photons. A space based X-ray telescope orbiting the Earth can detect these X-ray photons, while passing through the night side, thereby acting as a detector in this LSW type experiment. We show that such a kind of setup can be complementary to other terrestrial experiments looking for chameleons.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare the methods of our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.011 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.055$. However, as first noted in [1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>
