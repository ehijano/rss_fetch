      <title>Transversal Injection: Using the Surface Code to Prepare Non-Pauli Eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum computing systems for large scale algorithms requires targeted error rates un- achievable through hardware advancements alone. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) allows us to use systems with a large number of physical qubits to form a fault tolerant system with a lower number of logical qubits and a favourable logical error rate. While some gates can be easily implemented in a QEC code transversally, there is no code that has a universal set of transversal gates. Transversal Injection is a new method of preparing logical non-Pauli eigenstates that can be used as resource states for quantum computation. State preparation can be done directly in the surface code and has the potential to prepare higher fidelity injected states. Compared to other techniques, transversal injection can reduce the resource burden for state distillation protocols. In this paper, the authors present the theory behind this new technique as well as an algorithm for calculating the resulting logical states prepared in the surface code.</description>

      <title>Parallel Proportional Fusion of Spiking Quantum Neural Network for Optimizing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of the hybrid quantum-classical neural network (HQCNN) architecture has garnered considerable attention due to the potential advantages associated with integrating quantum principles to enhance various facets of machine learning algorithms and computations. However, the current investigated serial structure of HQCNN, wherein information sequentially passes from one network to another, often imposes limitations on the trainability and expressivity of the network. In this study, we introduce a novel architecture termed Parallel Proportional Fusion of Quantum and Spiking Neural Networks (PPF-QSNN). The dataset information is simultaneously fed into both the spiking neural network and the variational quantum circuits, with the outputs amalgamated in proportion to their individual contributions. We systematically assess the impact of diverse PPF-QSNN parameters on network performance for image classification, aiming to identify the optimal configuration. Numerical results on the MNIST dataset unequivocally illustrate that our proposed PPF-QSNN outperforms both the existing spiking neural network and the serial quantum neural network across metrics such as accuracy, loss, and robustness. This study introduces a novel and effective amalgamation approach for HQCNN, thereby laying the groundwork for the advancement and application of quantum advantage in artificial intelligent computations.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for probabilistic one-way secret-key distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic one-way distillable secret key is equal to the largest expected rate at which perfect secret key bits can be probabilistically distilled from a bipartite state by means of local operations and one-way classical communication. Here we define the set of super two-extendible states and prove that an arbitrary state in this set cannot be used for probabilistic one-way secret-key distillation. This broad class of states includes both erased states and all full-rank states. Comparing the probabilistic one-way distillable secret key with the more commonly studied approximate one-way distillable secret key, our results demonstrate an extreme gap between them for many states of interest, with the approximate one-way distillable secret key being much larger. Our findings naturally extend to probabilistic one-way entanglement distillation, with similar conclusions.</description>

      <title>A case study against QSVT: assessment of quantum phase estimation improved by signal processing techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum algorithms have been proposed which use quantum phase estimation (QPE) coherently as a subroutine without measurement. In order to do this effectively, the routine must be able to distinguish eigenstates with success probability close to unity. In this paper, we provide the first systematic comparison between two approaches towards maximizing this success probability, one using the quantum singular value transform and the other leveraging window functions, which have been previously studied as priors of the phase value distribution. We find that the quantum singular value transform is significantly outclassed by the window function approach, with the latter able to achieve between 3 and 5 orders of magnitude improvement in the success probability with approximately 1/4 the query cost. Our circuit simulation results indicate that QPE is not a domain which benefits from the integration of QSVT and we show that the use of the Kaiser window function is currently the most practical choice for realizing QPE with high success probability.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Approximate Optimization by Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \emph{Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping} (NDAR), a heuristic meta-algorithm for approximately solving binary optimization problems by leveraging certain types of noise. We consider access to a noisy quantum processor with dynamics that features a global attractor state. In a standard setting, such noise can be detrimental to the quantum optimization performance. In NDAR, the algorithm bootstraps the attractor by iteratively gauge-transforming the cost-function Hamiltonian. In each iteration step, the gauge transformation effectively changes the attractor state into a higher-quality solution of the cost Hamiltonian based on the results of variational optimization in the previous step. The end result is that noise aids variational optimization, as opposed to hindering it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm experiments with subsystems of the newest generation of Rigetti Computing's superconducting device Ankaa-2. We obtain approximation ratios (of best-found solutions) $0.9$-$0.96$ (spread across instances) for multiple instances of random, fully connected graphs (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) on $n=82$ qubits, using only depth $p=1$ (noisy) QAOA in conjunction with NDAR. This compares to $0.34$-$0.51$ for vanilla $p=1$ QAOA with the same number of function calls.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantum algorithm for generation of ab initio n-th order susceptibilities for non-linear spectroscpies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing $n$-th order response properties necessary for analysis of non-linear spectroscopies of molecular and condensed phase systems. We use a semi-classical description in which the electronic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically and the light is treated as a classical field. The algorithm we present can be viewed as an implementation of standard perturbation theory techniques, focused on {\it ab initio} calculation of $n$-th order response functions. We provide cost estimates in terms of the number of queries to the block encoding of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, as well as the block encodings of the perturbing dipole operators. Using the technique of eigenstate filtering, we provide an algorithm to extract excitation energies to resolution $\gamma$, and the corresponding linear response amplitude to accuracy $\epsilon$ using ${O}\left(N^{6}\eta^2{{\gamma^{-1}}\epsilon^{-1}}\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ queries to the block encoding of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$, in double factorized representation. Thus, our approach saturates the Heisenberg $O(\gamma^{-1})$ limit for energy estimation and allows for the approximation of relevant transition dipole moments. These quantities, combined with sum-over-states formulation of polarizabilities, can be used to compute the $n$-th order susceptibilities and response functions for non-linear spectroscopies under limited assumptions using $\widetilde{O}\left({N^{5n+1}\eta^{n+1}}/{\gamma^n\epsilon}\right)$ queries to the block encoding of $H_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a method of the quantum gate teleportation for converting circuit-based quantum computation primitives into fusion networks. By using the presented scheme for the CNOT gate we construct translation of the circuit for the foliated surface code into a fault tolerant fusion network. Finally, we construct two new fusion based quantum computation models and study their fault tolerance properties.</description>

      <title>Temporal quantum eraser: Fusion gates with distinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear-optics gates, the enabling tool of photonic quantum information processing, depend on indistinguishable photons, as they harness quantum interference to achieve nonlinear operations. Yet the required indistinguishability is related to the symmetry of the multiphoton wavefunction, and does not necessarily imply identical photons. Here we show for the case of two-photon gates that the ideal gate operation can be retrieved if one can guarantee the exchange symmetry of the input photonic state. Specifically, we employ a temporal quantum eraser to allow fusion gates with sources of modally-impure photons: parametric photon pair generation and single-photon extraction by a single quantum emitter. The ability to lift the requirement for identical photons bears considerable potential in linear-optics quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Role of the extended Hilbert space in the attainability of the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for multiparameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric logarithmic derivative Cram\'er-Rao bound (SLDCRB) provides a fundamental limit to the minimum variance with which a set of unknown parameters can be estimated in an unbiased manner. It is known that the SLDCRB can be saturated provided the optimal measurements for the individual parameters commute with one another. However, when this is not the case the SLDCRB cannot be attained in general. In the experimentally relevant setting, where quantum states are measured individually, necessary and sufficient conditions for when the SLDCRB can be saturated are not known. In this setting the SLDCRB is attainable provided the SLD operators can be chosen to commute on an extended Hilbert space. However, beyond this relatively little is known about when the SLD operators can be chosen in this manner. In this paper we present explicit examples which demonstrate novel aspects of this condition. Our examples demonstrate that the SLD operators commuting on any two of the following three spaces: support space, support-kernel space and kernel space, is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for commutativity on the extended space. We present a simple analytic example showing that the Nagaoka-Hayashi Cram\'er-Rao bound is not always attainable. Finally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB in the case when the kernel space is one-dimensional. These results provide new information on the necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB.</description>

      <title>Efficient, indistinguishable telecom C-band photons using a tapered nanobeam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telecom C-band single photons exhibit the lowest attenuation in optical fibers, enabling long-haul quantum-secured communication. However, efficient coupling with optical fibers is crucial for these single photons to be effective carriers in long-distance transmission. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient fiber-coupled single photon source at the telecom C-band using InAs/InP quantum dots coupled to a tapered nanobeam. The tapered nanobeam structure facilitates directional emission that is mode-matched to a lensed fiber, resulting in a collection efficiency of up to 65% from the nanobeam to a single-mode fiber. Using this approach, we demonstrate single photon count rates of 575 $\pm$ 5 Kcps and a single photon purity of $g^2$ (0) = 0.015 $\pm$ 0.003. Additionally, we demonstrate Hong-Ou Mandel interference from the emitted photons with a visibility of 0.84 $\pm$ 0.06. From these measurements, we determine a photon coherence time of 450 $\pm$ 20 ps, a factor of just 8.3 away from the lifetime limit. This work represents an important step towards the development of telecom C-band single-photon sources emitting bright, pure, and indistinguishable photons, which are necessary to realize fiber-based long-distance quantum networks</description>

      <title>Ab initio extended Hubbard model of short polyenes for efficient quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose introducing an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian derived via the ab initio downfolding method, which was originally formulated for periodic materials, towards efficient quantum computing of molecular electronic structure calculations. By utilizing this method, the first-principles Hamiltonian of chemical systems can be coarse-grained by eliminating the electronic degrees of freedom in higher energy space and reducing the number of terms of electron repulsion integral from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. Our approach is validated numerically on the vertical excitation energies and excitation characters of ethylene, butadiene, and hexatriene. The dynamical electron correlation is incorporated within the framework of the constrained random phase approximation in advance of quantum computations, and the constructed models capture the trend of experimental and high-level quantum chemical calculation results. As expected, the $L^1$-norm of the fermion-to-qubit mapped model Hamiltonians is significantly lower than that of conventional ab initio Hamiltonians, suggesting improved scalability of quantum computing. Those numerical outcomes and the results of the simulation of excited-state sampling demonstrate that the ab initio extended Hubbard Hamiltonian may hold significant potential for quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Search on Complete Bipartite Graphs by Continuous Time Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deterministic search algorithm on complete bipartite graphs. Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. We address the most general case of multiple marked states, so there is a problem of estimating the number of marked states. To this end, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model. We achieve simulation in constant time, that is, the complexity of the quantum circuit does not scale with the evolution time. Besides, deterministic search serves as a simple tool for perfect state transfer (PST). As an application, we explore the problem of PST on complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Coset Approach to Topological Quantum Computation with Fibonacci Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a promising conformal field theory realization scheme for topological quantum computation based on the Fibonacci anyons, which are believed to be realized as quasiparticle excitations in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion fractional quantum Hall state in the second Landau level with filling factor $\nu=12/5$. These anyons are non-Abelian and are known to be capable of universal topological quantum computation. The quantum information is encoded in the fusion channels of pairs of such non-Abelian anyons and is protected from noise and decoherence by the topological properties of these systems.The quantum gates are realized by braiding of these anyons. We propose here an implementation of the $n$-qubit topological quantum register in terms of $2n+2$ Fibonacci anyons. The matrices emerging from the anyon exchanges, i.e. the generators of the braid group for one qubit are derived from the coordinate wave functions of a large number of electron holes and 4 Fibonacci anyons which can furthermore be represented as correlation functions in $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic two-dimensional conformal field theory. The representations of the braid groups for more than 4 anyons are obtained by fusing pairs of anyons before braiding, thus reducing eventually the system to 4 anyons.</description>

      <title>A Kerr kernel quantum learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods are of current interest in quantum machine learning due to similarities with quantum computing in how they process information in high-dimensional feature (Hilbert) spaces. Kernels are believed to offer particular advantages when they cannot be computed classically, so a kernel matrix with indisputably nonclassical elements is desirable provided it can be generated efficiently in a particular physical machine. Kerr nonlinearities, known to be a route to universal continuous variable (CV) quantum computation, may be able to play this role for quantum machine learning. We propose a quantum hardware kernel implementation scheme based on superconducting quantum circuits. The scheme does not use qubits or quantum circuits but rather exploits the analogue features of Kerr coupled modes. Our approach is more akin to the growing number of analog machine learning schemes based on sampling quantum probabilities directly in an engineered device by stochastic quantum control.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for adiabatic elimination with fast unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called ``adiabatic elimination'' of fast decaying degrees of freedom in open quantum systems can be performed with a series expansion in the timescale separation. The associated computations are significantly more difficult when the remaining degrees of freedom (center manifold) follow fast unitary dynamics instead of just being slow. This paper highlights how a formulation with Sylvester's equation and with adjoint dynamics leads to systematic, explicit expressions at high orders for settings of physical interest.</description>

      <title>Consistent treatment of quantum systems with a time-dependent Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some basic problems associated with quantum mechanics of systems having a time-dependent Hilbert space. We provide a consistent treatment of these systems and address the possibility of describing them in terms of a time-independent Hilbert space. We show that in general the Hamiltonian operator does not represent an observable of the system even if it is a self-adjoint operator. This is related to a hidden geometric aspect of quantum mechanics arising from the presence of an operator-valued gauge potential. We also offer a careful treatment of quantum systems whose Hilbert space is obtained by endowing a time-independent vector space with a time-dependent inner product.</description>

      <title>Why is the universe not frozen by the quantum Zeno effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a discrete model that simulates the ubiquitous competition between the free internal evolution of a two-level system and the decoherence induced by the interaction with its surrounding environment. It is aimed at being as universal as possible, so that no specific Hamiltonian is assumed. This leads to an analytic criterion, depending on the level of short time decoherence, allowing to determine whether the system will freeze due to the Zeno effect. We check this criterion on several classes of functions which correspond to different physical situations. In the most generic case, the free evolution wins over decoherence, thereby explaining why the universe is indeed not frozen.</description>

      <title>Near-unity indistinguishability of single photons emitted from dissimilar and independent atomic quantum nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating indistinguishable photons from independent nodes is an important challenge for the development of quantum networks. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of highly indistinguishable single photons from two dissimilar atomic quantum nodes. One node is based on a fully blockaded cold Rydberg ensemble and generates on-demand single photons. The other node is a quantum repeater node based on a DLCZ quantum memory and emits heralded single photons after a controllable memory time that is used to synchronize the two sources. We demonstrate an indistinguishability of ${94.6 \pm 5.2 \%}$ for a temporal window including ${90\%}$ of the photons. This advancement opens new possibilities for interconnecting quantum repeater and processing nodes with high fidelity Bell-state measurement without sacrificing its efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum network shared entangled sources among distant nodes enables us to distribute entanglement along the network by suitable measurements. Network nonlocality means that it does not admit a network model involving local variables emitted from independent sources. In this work, we construct an $(n,m,p)$-type quantum network configuration and then derive the corresponding $n$-local correlation inequalities based on the assumption of independent sources. As a universal acyclic network configuration, it can cover most of the existing network models, such as the typical chain-network and star-network, and admit both centerless and asymmetric configurations. Then we demonstrate the non-$n$-locality of the present network by calculating the violation of the $n$-local inequality with bipartite entangled sources and Pauli measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimension, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Brownian Particles and Matter Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the remarkable progress in micro-rheology to monitor the random motion of Brownian particles with size as small as few nanometers, in association that de Broglie matter waves have been experimentally observed for large molecules of comparable nanometer size; we examine whether Brownian particles can manifest a particle-wave duality without employing a priori arguments from quantum decoherence. First, we examine the case where Brownian particles are immersed in a memoryless viscous fluid with a time-independent diffusion coefficient; and the requirement for the Brownian particles to manifest a particle-wave duality leads to the untenable result that the diffusion coefficient has to be proportional to the inverse time; therefore, diverging at early times. This finding agrees with past conclusions--that quantum mechanics is not equivalent to a Markovian diffusion process. Next, we examine the case where the Brownian particle is trapped in a harmonic potential well with and without dissipation. Both solutions of the Fokker-Plank equation for the case with dissipation, and of the Schrodinger equation for the case without dissipation lead to the same physically acceptable result-that for the Brownian particle to manifest a particle-wave duality, its mean kinetic energy needs to be half the ground-state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Our one-dimensional calculations show that for this to happen, the trapping needs to be very strong so that a Brownian nanoparticle needs to be embedded in an extremely stiff solid.</description>

      <title>QUSL: Quantum Unsupervised Image Similarity Learning with Enhanced Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum advantages to enhance machine learning capabilities has become a primary focus of research, particularly for complex tasks such as image similarity detection. To fully exploit the potential of quantum computing, it is essential to design quantum circuits tailored to the specific characteristics of the task at hand. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel quantum unsupervised similarity learning method, QUSL. Building upon the foundation of similarity detection triplets and generating positive samples through perturbations of anchor images, QUSL operates independently of classical oracles. By leveraging the performance of triplets and the characteristics of quantum circuits, QUSL systematically explores high-performance quantum circuit architectures customized for dataset features using metaheuristic algorithms, thereby achieving efficient quantum feature extraction with reduced circuit costs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate QUSL's remarkable performance compared to state-of-the-art quantum methods. QUSL achieves reductions exceeding 50% in critical quantum resource utilization while also realizing an enhancement of approximately 20% in similarity detection correlation across the DISC21, COCO, and landscape datasets. This enables efficient quantum similarity modeling for large-scale unlabeled image data with reduced quantum resource utilization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of symmetric measurements to collections of unequinumerous positive, operator-valued measures (POVMs). For informationally complete sets, we propose construction methods from orthonormal Hermitian operator bases. The correspondence between operator bases and measurements can be as high as four-to-four, with a one-to-one correspondence following only under additional assumptions. Importantly, it turns out that some of the symmetry properties, lost in the process of generalization, can be recovered without fixing the same number of elements for all POVMs. In particular, for a wide class of unequinumerous symmetric measurements that are conical 2-designs, we derive the index of coincidence, entropic uncertainty relations, and separability criteria for bipartite quantum states.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of an Optical Quantum Dot Using Phonons and Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine quantum-mechanical effects are readily observable in modern optomechanical systems comprising bosonic (``classical") optical resonators. Such systems have enabled laser-cooling of mesoscopic objects, generation of squeezed light, and the conversion of photons between microwave and optical modes. Here we demonstrate unique advantages of optical two-level systems, or qubits, for optomechanics. The qubit state can be coherently controlled using an immense variety of driving schemes including both phonons and resonant or detuned photons. We experimentally demonstrate this using charge-controlled InAs quantum dots (QDs) in surface-acoustic-wave resonators. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements reveal the control of QD population dynamics using engineered optical pulses and mechanical motion. As a first example, we show how this can improve signal-to-background scattering in microwave-to-optical transduction processes. Specifically, we tailor the scheme so that mechanically assisted photon scattering is enhanced over the direct detuned photon scattering from the optical system. These differences are greatly amplified by strategic temporal pulse shaping. Quantum-mechanical calculations show good agreement with our experimental results and provide guidance for adapting these schemes to small phonon occupancies relevant for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Quantum bistability at the interplay between collective and individual decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study driven collective radiation of an ensemble of atoms placed inside a cavity, accounting for individual-atom emission to free space modes. We find that the steady state exhibits a dissipative phase transition, formed by a mixture of two collective quantum states corresponding to a bistable mean-field solution. One of these states is entangled and closely resembles a coherently radiating spin state (CRSS) -- the solution obtained by neglecting individual decay (Dicke superradiance) -- allowing us to analytically find the optimally achievable spin squeezing. We predict quantum switching between the two states, verified by quantum trajectories simulations. The switching rate tends to vanish with the atom number, as the Liouvillan gap closes. Remarkably, this suggests that the system may reside in an entangled CRSS-like state associated with correlated Dicke physics, even in the presence of decorrelating individual decay. This opens a path for a systematic study of the interplay between collective and individual decay, in both experiments and theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of $SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full $\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of $\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$ ($q&gt;4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite $n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left( 4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered Weinberg-like equations in the article [1] in order to construct the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the spin-1 particles. This construction is based on the concept of the Weinberg field as a system of four field functions differing by parity and by dual transformations. We also analyzed the recent controversy in the definitions of the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the field operator containing the S=1/2 self/anti-self charge conjugate states in the papers by D. Ahluwalia et al and by W. Rodrigues Jr. et al. The solution to this mathematical controversy is obvious. I proposed the necessary doubling of the Fock Space (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding Clifford Algebra. Meanwhile, the N. Debergh et al article considered our old ideas of doubling the Dirac equation, and other forms of T- and PT-conjugation [5]. Both algebraic equation Det (\hat p - m) =0 and Det (\hat p + m) =0 for u- and v- 4-spinors have solutions with p_0= \pm E_p =\pm \sqrt{{\bf p}^2 +m^2}. The same is true for higher-spin equations (or they may even have more complicated dispersion relations). Meanwhile, every book considers the equality p_0=E_p for both u- and v- spinors of the (1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)) representation only, thus applying the Dirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg procedure for elimination of negative-energy solutions. It seems, that it is imposible to consider the relativistic quantum mechanics appropriately without negative energies, tachyons and appropriate forms of the discrete symmetries.</description>

      <title>Phase matching of high harmonic generation in the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how bright, fully coherent, hard x-ray beams can be generated through nonlinear upconversion of femtosecond laser light. By using longer-wavelength mid-infrared driving lasers of moderate peak intensity, full phase matching of the high harmonic generation process can extend, in theory, into the hard x-ray region of the spectrum. We identify the dominant phase matching mechanism for long wavelength driving lasers, and verify our predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase-matched up-conversion into the soft x-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV using an extended, high-pressure, gas medium that is weakly ionized by the laser. Scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making useful, fully coherent, multi-keV x-ray sources feasible. Finally, we show that the rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield at longer driving wavelengths is compensated macroscopically by an increasing optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated light at higher photon energies.</description>

Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>Accurate and precise quantum computation of valence two-neutron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing methods to solve nuclear many-body problems with quantum computers is an imperative pursuit within the nuclear physics community. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to accurately and precisely compute the ground state of valence two-neutron systems leveraging presently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. Our focus lies on the nuclei having a doubly-magic core plus two valence neutrons in the $ p $, $ sd $, and $ pf $ shells, i.e. ${}^6$He, ${}^{18}$O, and ${}^{42}$Ca, respectively. Our ansatz, quantum circuit, is constructed in the pair-wise form, taking into account the symmetries of the system in an explicit manner, and enables us to reduce the number of qubits and the number of CNOT gates required. The results on a real quantum hardware by IBM Quantum Platform show that the proposed method gives very accurate results of the ground-state energies, which are typically within $ 0.1 \, \% $ error in the energy for ${}^6$He and ${}^{18}$O and at most $ 1 \, \% $ error for ${}^{42}$Ca. Furthermore, our experiments using real quantum devices also show the pivotal role of the circuit layout design, attuned to the connectivity of the qubits, in mitigating errors.</description>

      <title>Quantum charges of harmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss ``antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>

      <title>QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging energies and sensor dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanosciences largely rely on plasmons which are quasiparticles constituted by collective oscillations of quantum electron gas composed of conduction band electrons that occupy discrete quantum states. Our work has introduced non-perturbative plasmons with oscillation amplitudes that approach the extreme limit set by breakdown in characteristic coherence. In contrast, conventional plasmons are small-amplitude oscillations. Controlled excitation of extreme plasmons modeled in our work unleashes unprecedented Petavolts per meter fields. In this work, an analytical model of this new class of plasmons is developed based on quantum kinetic framework. A controllable extreme plasmon, the surface "crunch-in" plasmon, is modeled here using a modified independent electron approximation which takes into account the quantum oscillation frequency. Key characteristics of such realizable extreme plasmons that unlock unparalleled possibilities, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the Lyapunov exponents and phase transitions of charged AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e. an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law singularity that can correspond to one of two processes. In the first process, the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions for each of the two cases and derive the asymptotic form of the distribution in the vicinity of the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atomic magnetometry using a metasurface polarizing beamsplitter fabricated on a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) platform. The metasurface splits a beam that is near-resonant with the rubidium atoms (795 nm) into orthogonal linear polarizations, enabling measurement of magnetically sensitive circular birefringence in a rubidium vapor through balanced polarimetry. We incorporated the metasurface into an atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation and measured sub-nanotesla sensitivity, which is limited by low-frequency technical noise and transmission loss through the metasurface. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of SOS nanophotonics for atom-based sensing and paves the way for highly integrated, miniaturized atomic sensors with enhanced sensitivity and portability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement individual addressing and readout of ions in a rigidly rotating planar crystal in a compact, permanent magnet Penning trap. The crystal of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ is trapped and stabilized without defects via a rotating triangular potential. The trapped ion fluorescence is detected in the rotating frame for parallel readout. The qubit is encoded in the metastable D$_{5/2}$ manifold enabling the use of high-power near-infrared laser systems for qubit operations. Addressed $\sigma_z$ operations are realized with a focused AC Stark shifting laser beam. We demonstrate addressing of ions near the center of the crystal and at large radii. Simulations show that the current addressing operation fidelity is limited to $\sim 97\%$ by the ion's thermal extent for the in-plane modes near the Doppler limit, but this could be improved to infidelities $&lt;10^{-3}$ with sub-Doppler cooling. The techniques demonstrated in this paper complete the set of operations for quantum simulation with the platform.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. For the first time, we see that the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear transport regimes are achieved using quantum point contacts in the same setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum illumination with noisy probes: Conditional advantages of non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled states, like the two-mode squeezed vacuum state, are known to give quantum advantage in the illumination protocol, a method to detect a weakly reflecting target submerged in a thermal background. We use non-Gaussian photon-added and -subtracted states, affected by local Gaussian noise on top of the omnipresent thermal noise, as probes in the illumination protocol. Based on the difference between the Chernoff bounds obtained with the coherent state and the non-Gaussian state having equal signal strengths, whose positive values denote quantum advantage in illumination, we highlight the hierarchy among non-Gaussian states, which is compatible with correlations per unit signal strength, although the Gaussian states offer the best performance. Interestingly, such hierarchy is different when comparisons are made using the Chernoff bounds. The entire analysis is performed in the presence of different imperfect apparatus like faulty twin-beam generator, imperfect photon addition (subtraction) as well as with noisy non-Gaussian probe states.</description>

      <title>Classical analogue of quantum superdense coding and communication advantage of a single quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze utility of communication channels in absence of any short of quantum or classical correlation shared between the sender and the receiver. To this aim, we propose a class of two-party communication games, and show that the games cannot be won given a noiseless $1$-bit classical channel from the sender to the receiver. Interestingly, the goal can be perfectly achieved if the channel is assisted with classical shared randomness. This resembles an advantage similar to the quantum superdense coding phenomenon where pre-shared entanglement can enhance the communication utility of a perfect quantum communication line. Quite surprisingly, we show that a qubit communication without any assistance of classical shared randomness can achieve the goal, and hence establishes a novel quantum advantage in the simplest communication scenario. In pursuit of a deeper origin of this advantage, we show that an advantageous quantum strategy must invoke quantum interference both at the encoding step by the sender and at the decoding step by the receiver. We also study communication utility of a class of non-classical toy systems described by symmetric polygonal state spaces. We come up with communication tasks that can be achieved neither with $1$-bit of classical communication nor by communicating a polygon system, whereas $1$-qubit communication yields a perfect strategy, establishing quantum advantage over them. To this end, we show that the quantum advantages are robust against imperfect encodings-decodings, making the protocols implementable with presently available quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations of the Hamiltonian dynamics of a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer - a digital twin - could play a major role in developing efficient and scalable strategies for tuning quantum algorithms for specific hardware. Via a two-dimensional tensor network digital twin of a Rydberg atom quantum computer, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a program. In particular, we quantify the effects of gate crosstalks induced by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms: according to an 8$\times$8 digital twin simulation based on the current state-of-the-art experimental setups, the initial state of a five-qubit repetition code can be prepared with a high fidelity, a first indicator for a compatibility with fault-tolerant quantum computing. The preparation of a 64-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with about 700~gates yields a $99.9\%$ fidelity in a closed system while achieving a speedup of $35\%$ via parallelization.</description>

Abstract: Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIKQD) aims at generating secret keys between distant parties without the parties trusting their devices. We investigate a proposal for performing fully photonic DIQKD, based on single-photon sources and heralding measurements at a central station placed between the two parties. We derive conditions to attain non-zero secret-key rates in terms of the the photon efficiency, indistinguishability and the second order autocorrelation function of the single-photon sources. Exploiting new results on the security bound of such protocols allows us to reduce the requirements on the physical parameters of the setup. Our analysis shows that in the considered schemes, key rates of several hundreds of secret bits per second are within reach at distances of several tens of kilometers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the form required for the time-dependent Rabi frequencies involved in a procedure capable to protect the action of quantum gates on an atomic qutrit by means of external fields continuously decoupling the system from the environmental noise. Several simulations are considered to protect the action of quantum-gate models, including randomly chosen ones. We argue that the requirements for the Rabi frequencies could be nowadays experimentally met. We also investigate the transition from one gate operation to another, including protecting a qutrit memory state. We finally apply our methodology to protect from noise the application of an algorithm capable of distinguishing the parity of permutations of three elements.</description>

      <title>Estimating truncation effects of quantum bosonic systems using sampling algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simulate bosons on a qubit- or qudit-based quantum computer, one has to regularize the theory by truncating infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions. In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper, we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue for a rather generic class of bosonic systems with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar field theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods. This method can be used to estimate the resources needed for realistic quantum simulations of bosonic theories, and also, to check the validity of the results of the corresponding quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I cut the cost of Y basis measurement and initialization in the surface code by nearly an order of magnitude. Fusing twist defects diagonally across the surface code patch reaches the Y basis in $\lfloor d/2 \rfloor + 2$ rounds, without leaving the bounding box of the patch and without reducing the code distance. I use Monte Carlo sampling to benchmark the performance of the construction under circuit noise, and to analyze the distribution of logical errors. Cheap inplace Y basis measurement reduces the cost of S gates and magic state factories, and unlocks Pauli measurement tomography of surface code qubits on space-limited hardware.</description>

Abstract: We present a powerful formalism, disordered collective dynamics using truncated equations (d-CUT-E), to simulate the ultrafast quantum dynamics of molecular polaritons in the collective strong coupling regime, where a disordered ensemble of $N\gg10^{6}$ molecules couples to a cavity mode. Notably, we can capture this dynamics with a cavity hosting a single \textit{effective} molecule with $\sim N_{bins}$ electronic states, where $N_{bins}\ll N$ is the number of bins discretizing the disorder distribution. Using d-CUT-E we conclude that strong coupling, as evaluated from linear optical spectra, can be a poor proxy for polariton chemistry. For highly disordered ensembles, total reaction yield upon broadband excitation is identical to that outside of the cavity, while narrowband excitation produces distinct reaction yields solely due to differences in the initial states prepared prior to the reaction.</description>

Abstract: We show how quantum-inspired 2d tensor networks can be used to efficiently and accurately simulate the largest quantum processors from IBM, namely Eagle (127 qubits), Osprey (433 qubits) and Condor (1121 qubits). We simulate the dynamics of a complex quantum many-body system -specifically, the kicked Ising experiment considered recently by IBM in Nature 618, p. 500-505 (2023)- using graph-based Projected Entangled Pair States (gPEPS), which was proposed by some of us in PRB 99, 195105 (2019). Our results show that simple tensor updates are already sufficient to achieve very large unprecedented accuracy with remarkably low computational resources for this model. Apart from simulating the original experiment for 127 qubits, we also extend our results to 433 and 1121 qubits, and for evolution times around 8 times longer, thus setting a benchmark for the newest IBM quantum machines. We also report accurate simulations for infinitely-many qubits. Our results show that gPEPS are a natural tool to efficiently simulate quantum computers with an underlying lattice-based qubit connectivity, such as all quantum processors based on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum properties from short-range correlations using multi-task networks</title>

Abstract: Characterizing multipartite quantum systems is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics. The problem, however, becomes challenging when the system size is large and the properties of interest involve correlations among a large number of particles. Here we introduce a neural network model that can predict various quantum properties of many-body quantum states with constant correlation length, using only measurement data from a small number of neighboring sites. The model is based on the technique of multi-task learning, which we show to offer several advantages over traditional single-task approaches. Through numerical experiments, we show that multi-task learning can be applied to sufficiently regular states to predict global properties, like string order parameters, from the observation of short-range correlations, and to distinguish between quantum phases that cannot be distinguished by single-task networks. Remarkably, our model appears to be able to transfer information learnt from lower dimensional quantum systems to higher dimensional ones, and to make accurate predictions for Hamiltonians that were not seen in the training.</description>

Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a quantum system interacting with white non-Gaussian baths: Poisson noise master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems are unavoidably open to their surrounding degrees of freedom. The theory of open quantum systems is thus crucial to understanding the fluctuations, dissipation, and decoherence of a quantum system of interest. Typically, the bath is modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, which yields Gaussian statistics of the bath influence on the quantum systems. However, there are also phenomena in which the bath consists of two-state systems, spins, or anharmonic oscillators; therefore, the non-Gaussian properties of the bath become important. Nevertheless, a theoretical framework to describe quantum systems under the influence of such non-Gaussian baths is not well established. Here, we develop a theory to describe quantum dissipative systems affected by Poisson noise properties of the bath, because the L\'evi-It\^o decomposition theorem asserts that Poisson noise is fundamental in describing arbitrary white noise beyond Gaussian properties. We introduce a quantum bath model that allows for the consistent description of dissipative quantum systems. The obtained master equation reveals non-Gaussian bath effects in the white noise regime, and provides an essential step toward describing open quantum dynamics under the influence of generic baths.</description>

Abstract: Energy filter methods in combination with quantum simulation can efficiently access the properties of quantum many-body systems at finite energy densities [Lu et al. PRX Quantum 2, 020321 (2021)]. Classically simulating this algorithm with tensor networks can be used to investigate the microcanonical properties of large spin chains, as recently shown in [Yang et al. Phys. Rev. B 106, 024307 (2022)]. Here we extend this strategy to explore the properties of off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the energy eigenbasis, fundamentally connected to the thermalization behavior and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We test the method on integrable and non-integrable spin chains of up to 60 sites, much larger than accessible with exact diagonalization. Our results allow us to explore the scaling of the off-diagonal functions with the size and energy difference, and to establish quantitative differences between integrable and non-integrable cases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a method of ensuring security using the laws of physics, avoiding the risks inherent in cryptosystems protected by computational complexity. Here we investigate the feasibility of satellite-based quantum key exchange using low-cost compact nano-satellites. This paper demonstrates the first prototype of system level quantum key distribution aimed at the Cube satellite scenario. It consists of a transmitter payload, a ground receiver and simulated free space channel to verify the timing and synchronisation (T&amp;S) scheme designed for QKD and the required high loss tolerance of both QKD and T&amp;S channels. The transmitter is designed to be deployed on various up-coming nano-satellite missions in the UK and internationally. The effects of channel loss, background noise, gate width and mean photon number on the secure key rate (SKR) and quantum bit error rate (QBER) are discussed. We also analyse the source of QBER and establish the relationship between effective signal noise ratio (ESNR) and noise level, signal strength, gating window and other parameters as a reference for SKR optimization. The experiment shows that it can tolerate the 40 dB loss expected in space to ground QKD and with small adjustment decoy states can be achieved. The discussion offers valuable insight not only for the design and optimization of miniature low-cost satellite-based QKD systems but also any other short or long range free space QKD on the ground or in the air.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Lindbladian Dynamics via Repeated Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation generalizes the Schr\"{o}dinger equation to quantum systems that undergo dissipative dynamics. The quantum simulation of Lindbladian dynamics is therefore non-unitary, preventing a naive application of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on Repeated Interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation. Specifically, we show that the number of interactions needed to simulate the Liouvillian $e^{t\mathcal{L}}$ within error $\epsilon$ scales in a weak coupling limit as $\nu\in O(t^2\|\mathcal{L}\|_{1\rightarrow 1}^2/\epsilon)$. This is significant because the error in the Lindbladian approximation to the dynamics is not explicitly bounded in existing quantum algorithms for open system simulations. We then provide quantum algorithms to simulate RI maps using an iterative Qubitization approach and Trotter-Suzuki formulas and specifically show that for iterative Qubitization the number of operations needed to simulate the dynamics (for a fixed value of $\nu$) scales in a weak coupling limit as $O(\alpha_0 t + \nu \log(1/\epsilon)/\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ where $\alpha_0$ is the coefficient $1$-norm for the system and bath Hamiltonians. This scaling would appear to be optimal if the complexity of $\nu$ is not considered, which underscores the importance of considering the error in the Liouvillian that we reveal in this work.</description>

      <title>Passive and Deterministic Controlled-phase Gate for Single-photon Wavepackets Based on Time-reversal Symmetric Photon Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the construction of a passive, deterministic and near unity-fidelity controlled-$\pi$-phase gate for single-photon wavepackets with a node comprising a two-level emitter and a small number of cavities. The proposed gate is rooted in the principle of time-reversal symmetric photon transport, which makes the entire photon transport process through the node into a perfect absorption and re-emission process. Consequently, it can circumvent the longstanding issue of wavepacket distortion inherent in photonic phase gates employing nonlinear media. Through such a time-reversal symmetric wavepacket transport process, the two-level emitter induces a nonlinear $\pi$ phase shift for the case of two-photon transport. Notably, for both single-photon and two-photon operations, the gate fidelity can exceed 99\% for a node with only four cavities. Moreover, our proposed gate architecture is compatible with the platforms of integrated photonics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum target detection (QTD) utilizes nonclassical resources to enable radar-like detection for identifying reflecting objects in challenging environments, surpassing classical methods. To fully leverage the quantum advantage in QTD, determining the optimal probe states (OPSs) across various detection parameters and gaining a deeper understanding of their characteristics are crucial. In this study, we identified the single-mode continuous-variable OPSs for arbitrary object reflectivity using optimization algorithms. Our findings suggest that OPSs are non-Gaussian states in most reflectivity scenarios, with exceptions under specific conditions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive physical interpretation of the observed phenomena. This study offers a tool for identifying OPSs along with a clear physical interpretation. It also contributes to further advancements towards optimal multi-mode QTD, which has the potential for broad applications in quantum sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Beyond unital noise in variational quantum algorithms: noise-induced barren plateaus and fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau (BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown to exist for unital noise maps. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to more general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the existence of NIBPs in the unital case and a class of non-unital maps we call Hilbert-Schmidt (HS)-contractive. The latter includes amplitude damping. We tighten to logarithmic earlier bounds on the circuit depth at which an NIBP appears. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced fixed points (NIFP) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and HS-contractive non-unital noise maps. Along the way, we extend the parameter shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the relevant parameters that give rise to NIBPs and NIFPs, along with numerical simulations of the depolarizing and amplitude-damping maps that illustrate our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: The measurement of the tunneling time-delay in attosecond experiments, termed attoclock, despite its controversies, offers a fruitful opportunity to understand the tunneling time and the tunnel-ionization process. In previous work, we showed a model that well describes the time-delay measured by the attoclock experiment in the adiabatic and nonadiabatic field calibrations. In the present work we show that the tunneling time reveals a universal behavior, with disentangled contribution, where the barrier time-delay can be convincingly defined and determined from the difference between the time-delay of adiabatic and nonadiabatic tunnel-ionization, with good agreement with the experimental result. Furthermore, we show that in the weak measurement limit, the barrier time-delay corresponds to the Larmor-clock time and the interaction time within the barrier.</description>

Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermalization in contemporary quantum devices, in particular quantum computers, has recently attracted significant theoretical interest. Unusual thermalization processes, such as the Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME), have been explored theoretically. However, there is a shortage of experimental results due to the difficulty in preparing thermal states. In this paper, we propose a method to address this challenge. Moreover, we experimentally validate our approach using IBM quantum devices, providing results for unusal relaxation in equidistant quenches as predicted for the IBM qubit. We also assess the formalism introduced for the QME, obtaining results consistent with the theoretical predictions. This demonstration underscores that our method can streamline the investigation of thermal states and thermalization in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Noisy atomic magnetometry with Kalman filtering and measurement-based feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking a magnetic field in real-time with an atomic magnetometer presents significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters. These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed, the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate for large ensembles that the EKF not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.</description>

Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSM) play a significant role in quantum information and quantum computing, in particular, in fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC). The FBQC model is a framework for universal quantum computing provided that we are able to perform entangling measurements, called fusions, on qubits within small entangled resource states. Here we analyse the usage of different linear-optical BSM circuits as fusions in the FBQC schemes and numerically evaluate hardware requirements for fault-tolerance in this framework. We examine and compare the performance of several BSM circuits with varying additional resources and estimate the requirements on losses for every component of the linear-optical realization of fusions under which errors in fusion networks caused by these losses can be corrected. Our results show that fault-tolerant quantum computing in the FBQC model is possible with currently achievable levels of optical losses in an integrated photonic implementation, provided that we can create and detect single photons of the resource states with a total marginal efficiency higher than 0.973.</description>

Abstract: Dirac-Coulomb type differential equation and its solution relativistic exponential-type spinor orbitals are introduced. They provide a revised form for operator invariants, namely Dirac invariants, simplifying the treatment of the angular components in calculation of many-electron systems. The relativistic Coulomb energy is determined by employing a spectral solution to Poisson's equation for the one-electron potential, which is expressed in terms of radial functions involving incomplete gamma functions. The computation for incomplete gamma functions posses challenges due to slow convergence rate associated with their series representation. Such difficulties are eliminated through use of the bi-directional method along with hyper-radial functions. A new formulation for relativistic auxiliary functions that improve the efficiency in Coulomb energy calculations is presented. These formulations also contribute to inquiring into orthogonal expansions for solutions to Poisson's equation using complete orthonormal sets of exponential orbitals with non-integer principal quantum numbers. They may provide a meaningful alternative series representations.</description>

Abstract: Communication and sensing technology play a significant role in various aspects of modern society. A seamless combination of the communication and the sensing systems is desired and have attracted great interests in recent years. Here, we propose and demonstrate a network architecture that integrating the downstream quantum access network (DQAN) and vibration sensing in optical fibers. By encoding the key information of eight users simultaneously on the sidemode quantum states of a single laser source and successively separating them by a filter network, we achieve a secure and efficient DQAN with an average key rate of 1.88*10^4 bits per second over an 80 km single-mode fiber. Meanwhile, the vibration location with spatial resolution of 120 m, 24 m, and 8 m at vibration frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz, respectively, is implemented with the existing infrastructure of the DQAN system. Our integrated architecture provides a viable and cost-effective solution for building a secure quantum communication sensor network, and open the way for expanding the functionality of quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Syndrome Decoder for Heavy Hexagonal QECC via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error syndromes for heavy hexagonal code and other topological codes such as surface code have typically been decoded by using Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) based methods. Recent advances have shown that topological codes can be efficiently decoded by deploying machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular with neural networks. In this work, we first propose an ML based decoder for heavy hexagonal code and establish its efficiency in terms of the values of threshold and pseudo-threshold, for various noise models. We show that the proposed ML based decoding method achieves $\sim5 \times$ higher values of threshold than that for MWPM.
  Next, exploiting the property of subsystem codes, we define gauge equivalence for heavy hexagonal code, by which two distinct errors can belong to the same error class. A linear search based method is proposed for determining the equivalent error classes. This provides a quadratic reduction in the number of error classes to be considered for both bit flip and phase flip errors, and thus a further improvement of $\sim 14\%$ in the threshold over the basic ML decoder. Lastly, a novel technique based on rank to determine the equivalent error classes is presented, which is empirically faster than the one based on linear search.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands from Hilbert Space Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a mechanism to generate entanglement islands in quantum systems from a purely quantum information perspective. More explicitly we show that, if we impose certain constraints on a quantum system by projecting out certain states in the Hilbert space, it is possible that for all the states remaining in the reduced Hilbert space, there exits subsets $I_a$ whose states are encoded in the states of another subset $\mathcal{R}_a$. Then the subsets $\{I_a\}$ are just the entanglement islands of the corresponding subsets $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}$. We call such a system self-encoded, and find that the entanglement entropy in such systems should be calculated by a new island formula. We give a comparison between our new island formula and island formula in gravitational theories. Inspired by our mechanism, we propose a simulation of the AdS/BCFT correspondence and the island phases in this context via a holographic CFT$_2$ with a special Weyl transformation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a finite-size reservoir</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nano-scale systems coupled to finite-size reservoirs, the reservoir temperature may fluctuate due to heat exchange between the system and the reservoirs. To date, a stochastic thermodynamic analysis of heat, work and entropy production in such systems is however missing. Here we fill this gap by analyzing a single-level quantum dot tunnel coupled to a finite-size electronic reservoir. The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation, depending on the fluctuating temperature of the reservoir. Based on a fluctuation theorem, we identify the appropriate entropy production that results in a thermodynamically consistent statistical description. We illustrate our results by analyzing the work production for a finite-size reservoir Szilard engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stress tensor of a real scalar quantum field on Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter spacetime exhibits correlations over macroscopic distances near the Cauchy horizon. These diverge as the Cauchy horizon is approached and are universal, i.e., state-independent. This signals a breakdown of the semi-classical approximation near the Cauchy horizon. We also investigate the effect of turning on a charge of the scalar field and consider the correlation of the stress tensor between the two poles of the Cauchy horizon of Kerr-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Full Counting Statistics of Charge in Quenched Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unless constrained by symmetry, measurement of an observable on an ensemble of identical quantum systems returns a distribution of values which are encoded in the full counting statistics. While the mean value of this distribution is important for determining certain properties of a system, the full distribution can also exhibit universal behavior. In this paper we study the full counting statistics of particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which have been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time evolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a Bose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting statistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled cumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply related and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters. Using the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the cumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time dynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the scaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting charge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit distinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity for measurement-induced non-unitary dynamics and Zeno effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spread complexity and spread entropy, we study non-unitary quantum dynamics. For non-hermitian Hamiltonians, we extend the bi-Lanczos construction for the Krylov basis to the Schr\"odinger picture. Moreover, we implement an algorithm adapted to complex symmetric Hamiltonians. This reduces the computational memory requirements by half compared to the bi-Lanczos construction. We apply this construction to the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian subject to repeated measurements at fixed small time intervals, resulting in effective non-unitary dynamics. We find that the spread complexity initially grows with time, followed by an extended decay period and saturation. The choice of initial state determines the saturation value of complexity and entropy. In analogy to measurement-induced phase transitions, we consider a quench between hermitian and non-hermitian Hamiltonian evolution induced by turning on regular measurements at different frequencies. We find that as a function of the measurement frequency, the time at which the spread complexity starts growing increases. This time asymptotes to infinity when the time gap between measurements is taken to zero, indicating the onset of the quantum Zeno effect, according to which measurements impede time evolution.</description>

      <title>Accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo simulation for heavy quark thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is one of the most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction. The energy loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. Recent advances in quantum computing, in particular quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), promise to provide a quadratic speed-up in simulating stochastic processes. We introduce and formalize an accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo (aQCMC) framework to simulate heavy quark thermalization. With simplified drag and diffusion coefficients connected by Einstein's relation, we simulate the thermalization of a heavy quark in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum simulator and compare that to thermal expectations. With Grover-like QAE, we calculate physical observables with quadratically fewer resources, which is a boost over the classical MC simulation that usually requires a large sampling number at the same estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-time Impurity Solver Using Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function $G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than in the unitary time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for dipole exchange-induced grating (DEIG) based on a hybrid system consisting of ultra-cold Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atomic ensemble and movable Rydberg spin atoms. The optical response of the grating appears as a superposition of three- and four-level configurations, similar to the cooperative optical nonlinear effect caused by the dipole blockade effect. However, such Rydberg atomic grating uniquely responds to the spatial positions of spin atoms, offering a novel approach to dynamically control electromagnetically induced gratings (EIG) except for input probe intensity.</description>
