      <title>Volatility Forecasting in Global Financial Markets Using TimeMixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting volatility in financial markets, including stocks, index ETFs, foreign exchange, and cryptocurrencies, remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and non-linear dynamics of these time series. In this study, I apply TimeMixer, a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model, to predict the volatility of global financial assets. TimeMixer utilizes a multiscale-mixing approach that effectively captures both short-term and long-term temporal patterns by analyzing data across different scales. My empirical results reveal that while TimeMixer performs exceptionally well in short-term volatility forecasting, its accuracy diminishes for longer-term predictions, particularly in highly volatile markets. These findings highlight TimeMixer's strength in capturing short-term volatility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in financial risk management, where precise short-term forecasts are critical. However, the model's limitations in long-term forecasting point to potential areas for further refinement.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Next Targets of Activist Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops a predictive model to identify potential targets of activist investment funds, which strategically acquire significant corporate stakes to drive operational and strategic improvements and enhance shareholder value. Predicting these targets is crucial for companies to mitigate intervention risks, for activists to select optimal targets, and for investors to capitalize on associated stock price gains. Our analysis utilizes data from the Russell 3000 index from 2016 to 2022. We tested 123 variations of models using different data imputation, oversampling, and machine learning methods, achieving a top AUC-ROC of 0.782. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in identifying likely targets of activist funds. We applied the Shapley value method to determine the most influential factors in a company's susceptibility to activist investment. This interpretative approach provides clear insights into the driving forces behind activist targeting. Our model offers stakeholders a strategic tool for proactive corporate governance and investment strategy, enhancing understanding of the dynamics of activist investing.</description>
