      <title>MR-zero meets FLASH -- Controlling the transient signal decay in gradient- and rf-spoiled gradient echo sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract Purpose The complex signal decay during the transient FLASH MRI readout can lead to artifacts in magnitude and phase images. We show that target-driven optimization of individual rf flip angles and phases can realize near-ideal signal behavior and mitigate artifacts. Methods The differentiable end-to-end optimization framework MR-zero is used to optimize rf trains of the FLASH sequence. We focus herein on minimizing deviations from the ideally spoiled signal by using a mono-exponential Look-Locker target. We first obtain the transient FLASH signal decay substructure, and then minimize the deviation to the Look-Locker decay by optimizing the individual (i) flip angles, (ii) rf phases and (iii) flip angles and rf phases. Comparison between measurement and simulation are performed using Pulseq in 1D and 2D. Results We could reproduce the complex substructure of the transient FLASH signal decay. All three optimization objectives can bring the real FLASH signal closer to the ideal case, with best results when both flip angles and rf phases are adjusted jointly. This solution outperformed all tested conventional quadratic rf cyclings in terms of (i) matching the Look-Locker target signal, (ii) phase stability, (iii) PSF ideality, (iv) robustness against parameter changes, and (v) magnitude and phase image quality. Other target functions for the signal could as well be realized, yet, their response is not as general as for the Look-Locker target and need to be optimized for a specific context. Conclusion Individual flip angle and rf phase optimization improves the transient signal decay of FLASH MRI sequences.</description>

      <title>HAITCH: A Framework for Distortion and Motion Correction in Fetal Multi-Shell Diffusion-Weighted MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is pivotal for probing the microstructure of the rapidly-developing fetal brain. However, fetal motion during scans and its interaction with magnetic field inhomogeneities result in artifacts and data scattering across spatial and angular domains. The effects of those artifacts are more pronounced in high-angular resolution fetal dMRI, where signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Those effects lead to biased estimates and compromise the consistency and reliability of dMRI analysis. This work presents HAITCH, the first and the only publicly available tool to correct and reconstruct multi-shell high-angular resolution fetal dMRI data. HAITCH offers several technical advances that include a blip-reversed dual-echo acquisition for dynamic distortion correction, advanced motion correction for model-free and robust reconstruction, optimized multi-shell design for enhanced information capture and increased tolerance to motion, and outlier detection for improved reconstruction fidelity. The framework is open-source, flexible, and can be used to process any type of fetal dMRI data including single-echo or single-shell acquisitions, but is most effective when used with multi-shell multi-echo fetal dMRI data that cannot be processed with any of the existing tools. Validation experiments on real fetal dMRI scans demonstrate significant improvements and accurate correction across diverse fetal ages and motion levels. HAITCH successfully removes artifacts and reconstructs high-fidelity fetal dMRI data suitable for advanced diffusion modeling, including fiber orientation distribution function estimation. These advancements pave the way for more reliable analysis of the fetal brain microstructure and tractography under challenging imaging conditions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Signature of Thermo-Electric Cardiac Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing new methods for predicting electromagnetic instabilities in cardiac activity is of primary importance. However, we still need a comprehensive view of the heart's magnetic activity at the tissue scale. To fill this gap, we present a model of soft active matter, including thermo-electric coupling, suitably modified to reproduce cardiac magnetic field. Our theoretical framework shows that periodic stimulations of cardiac cells create an external magnetic field evidencing restitution features of nonlinear cardiac dynamics and magnetic restitution curves better discriminate instabilities and bifurcations in cardiac activity. This new framework lays the foundation for innovative, non-invasive diagnostic tools for cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Robustness Testing of Black-Box Models Against CT Degradation Through Test-Time Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation and object detection are becoming increasingly available as clinical products. However, as details are rarely provided about the training data, models may unexpectedly fail when cases differ from those in the training distribution. An approach allowing potential users to independently test the robustness of a model, treating it as a black box and using only a few cases from their own site, is key for adoption. To address this, a method to test the robustness of these models against CT image quality variation is presented. In this work we present this framework by demonstrating that given the same training data, the model architecture and data pre processing greatly affect the robustness of several frequently used segmentation and object detection methods to simulated CT imaging artifacts and degradation. Our framework also addresses the concern about the sustainability of deep learning models in clinical use, by considering future shifts in image quality due to scanner deterioration or imaging protocol changes which are not reflected in a limited local test dataset.</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Weak Surface Diaphragmatic Electromyogram Using Modified Progressive FastICA Peel-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) contains crucial information about human respiration therefore can be used to monitor respiratory condition. Although it is practical to record EMGdi noninvasively and conveniently by placing surface electrodes over chest skin, extraction of such weak surface EMGdi (sEMGdi) from great noisy environment is a challenging task, limiting its clinical use compared with esophageal EMGdi. In this paper, a novel method is presented for extracting weak sEMGdi signal from high-noise environment based on fast independent component analysis (FastICA), constrained FastICA and a peel-off strategy. It is truly a modified version of of progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) framework, where the constrained FastICA helps to extract and refine respiration-related sEMGdi signals, while the peel-off strategy ensures the complete extraction of weaker sEMGdi components. The method was validated using both synthetic and clinical signals. It was demonstrated that our method was able to extract clean sEMGdi signals efficiently with little distortion. It outperformed state-of-the-art comparison methods in terms of sufficiently high SIR and CORR at all noise levels when tested on synthetic data, while also achieved an accuracy of 95.06% and a F2-score of 96.73% for breath identification on clinical data. The study presents a valuable solution for noninvasive extraction of sEMGdi signals, providing a convenient and valuable way of ventilator synchrony with a significant potential in aiding respiratory rehabilitation and health.</description>

      <title>A universal bioluminescence tomography system for pre-clinical image-guided radiotherapy research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CBCT-guided small animal irradiators encounter challenges in localizing soft-tissue targets due to low imaging contrast. Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) offers a promising solution, but they have largely remained in laboratorial development, limiting accessibility for researchers. In this work, we develop a universal, commercial-graded BLT-guided system (MuriGlo) designed to seamlessly integrate with commercial irradiators and empower researchers for translational studies. We demonstrate its capabilities in supporting in vitro and in vivo studies. The MuriGlo comprises detachable mouse bed, thermostatic control, mirrors, filters, and CCD, enabling multi-projection and multi-spectral imaging. We evaluate that the thermostatic control effectively sustains animal temperature at 37{\deg}C throughout imaging, and quantify that the system can detect as few as 61 GL261-AkaLuc cells in vitro. To illustrate how the MuriGlo can be utilized for in vivo image-guided research, we present 3 strategies, BLT-guided 5-arc, 2-field box, and BLI-guided single-beam, ranging from complicated high-conformal to simplest high-throughput plans. The high conformal BLT-guided 5-arc plan fully covers the gross tumor volume (GTV) at prescribed dose with minimal normal tissue exposure (3.9%), while the simplified, high-throughput BLT-guided 2-field box achieves 100% GTV coverage but results in higher normal tissue exposure (13.1%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization accuracy of MuriGlo for both widely-used SARRP and SmART irradiators is within1 mm, and the tumor coverage reaches over 97% with 0.75mm margin. The universal BLT-guided system offers seamless integration with commercial irradiators, achieving comparable localization accuracy, expected to supporting high-precision radiation research.</description>
