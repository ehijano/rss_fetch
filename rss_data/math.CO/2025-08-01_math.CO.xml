      <title>Domination, matching and transversal numbers for Berge-$G$ hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a graph and $H=(V(H),E(H))$ be a hypergraph. The hypergraph $H$ is a {\it Berge-G} if there is a bijection $f : E(G) \mapsto E(H)$ such that for each $e \in E(G)$ we have $e \subseteq f(e)$. We define {\it dilations of $G$} as a particular subfamily of not necessarily uniform Berge-$G$ hypergraphs. We examine domination, matching and transversal numbers and some relation between these parameters in that family of hypergraphs.
  Our work generalizes previous results concerning generalized power hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Character theoretic techniques for nonabelian partial difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-partial difference set (PDS) is a subset $D$ of size $k$ of a group $G$ of order $v$ such that every nonidentity element $g$ of $G$ can be expressed in either $\lambda$ or $\mu$ different ways as a product $xy^{-1}$, $x, y \in D$, depending on whether or not $g$ is in $D$. If $D$ is inverse closed and $1 \notin D$, then the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(G,D)$ is a $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-strongly regular graph (SRG). PDSs have been studied extensively over the years, especially in abelian groups, where techniques from character theory have proven to be particularly effective. Recently, there has been considerable interest in studying PDSs in nonabelian groups, and the purpose of this paper is develop character theoretic techniques that apply in the nonabelian setting. We prove that analogues of character theoretic results of Ott about generalized quadrangles of order $s$ also hold in the general PDS setting, and we are able to use these techniques to compute the intersection of a putative PDS with the conjugacy classes of the parent group in many instances. With these techniques, we are able to prove the nonexistence of PDSs in numerous instances and provide severe restrictions in cases when such PDSs may still exist. Furthermore, we are able to use these techniques constructively, computing several examples of PDSs in nonabelian groups not previously recognized in the literature, including an infinite family of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner triple systems originally studied by Clapham and related infinite families of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner $2$-designs first studied by Wilson.</description>

      <title>Binary matroids and degree-boundedness for pivot-minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every bipartite graph $H$ and positive integer $s$, the class of $K_{s,s}$-subgraph-free graphs excluding $H$ as a pivot-minor has bounded average degree. Our proof relies on the announced binary matroid structure theorem of Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle.
  Along the way, we also prove that every $K_{s,t}$-free bipartite circle graph with $s\le t$ has a vertex of degree at most $\max\{2s-2, t-1\}$ and provide examples showing that this is tight.</description>

      <title>Weighted $K$-$k$-Schur functions and their application to the $K$-$k$-Schur alternating conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new concept of weighted $K$-$k$-Schur functions -- a novel family within the broader class of Katalan functions -- that unifies and extends both $K$-$k$-Schur functions and closed $k$-Schur Katalan functions. This new notion exhibits a fundamental alternating property under certain conditions on the indexed $k$-bounded partitions. As a central application, we resolve the $K$-$k$-Schur alternating conjecture -- posed by Blasiak, Morse, and Seelinger in 2022 -- for a wide class of $k$-bounded partitions, including all strictly decreasing $k$-bounded partitions. Our results shed new light on the combinatorial structure of $K$-theoretic symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Perfecting the Line Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two canonical constructions that transform arbitrary finite graphs into perfect graphs: the symmetric lift $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$, which is purely structural and label-invariant, and the ordered lift $\mathrm{HL}_2(G)$, which depends explicitly on vertex labeling and encodes directional information. Both lifts arise as line graphs of bipartite double covers and are box-perfect.
  The symmetric lift $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ forms a canonical 2-cover of the line graph $L(G)$. This involution decomposes $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ into symmetric and antisymmetric components: the symmetric part recovers $L(G)$, while the antisymmetric part yields a signed graph $L^-(G)$, the antisymmetric line graph, with +1/-1 edges encoding consistent vs. crossed overlaps. Thus, all adjacency and Laplacian eigenvalues of $L(G)$, with multiplicities, appear within those of $\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$, despite $L(G)$ typically not being a subgraph.
  For regular graphs such as Paley graphs, this yields infinite families of sparse, highly structured regular and box-perfect expanders that also retain large cliques. The lift retains much of the spectral expansion of the base while improving the combinatorial expansion. Much the same behavior is observed with random regular base graphs, allowing for the possibility of the study of box-perfect random regular graphs.
  Finally, we generalize these constructions to parameterized lifts $\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}(G)$ and $\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}'(G)$ defined on ordered $r$-tuples connected by Hamming distance constraints, which structurally encode the base graph and remain box-perfect.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in arrow relations and traces of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arrow relation, a central concept in extremal set theory, captures quantitative relationships between families of sets and their traces. Formally, the arrow relation $(n, m) \rightarrow (a, b)$ signifies that for any family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with $|\mathcal{F}| \geqslant m$, there exists an $a$-element subset $T \subseteq [n]$ such that the trace $\mathcal{F}_{|T} = \{ F \cap T : F \in \mathcal{F} \}$ contains at least $b$ distinct sets. This survey highlights recent progress on a variety of problems and results connected to arrow relations. We explore diverse topics, broadly categorized by different extremal perspectives on these relations, offering a cohesive overview of the field.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$ is the projection of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subgeometry $\Sigma$ of $\mathrm{PG}(4,q^5)$ from a plane $\Gamma$ external to the secant variety to $\Sigma$. The pair $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ will be called a projecting configuration for the linear set. The projecting configurations for the only known maximum scattered linear sets in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, namely those of pseudoregulus and LP type, have been characterized in the literature by B. Csajb\'{o}k, C. Zanella in 2016 and by C. Zanella, F. Zullo in 2020. Let $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ be a projecting configuration for a maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\mathbb{G}=\mathrm{P}\Gamma \mathrm{L}(5,q^5)_\Sigma$, and $A=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^4}$, $B=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^3}$. If $A$ and $B$ are not both points, then the projected linear set is of pseudoregulus type. Then, suppose that they are points. The rank of a point $X$ is the vectorial dimension of the span of the orbit of $X$ under the action of $\mathbb{G}$. In this paper, by investigating the geometric properties of projecting configurations, it is proved that if at least one of the points $A$ and $B$ has rank 5, the associated maximum scattered linear set must be of LP type. Then, if a maximum scattered linear set of a new type exists, it must be such that $\mathrm{rk} A=\mathrm{rk} B=4$. In this paper we derive two possible polynomial forms that such a linear set must have. An exhaustive analysis by computer shows that for $q\leq 25$, no new maximum scattered linear set exists.</description>

      <title>Fuss--Catalan algebras on generalized Dyck paths via non-crossing partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fuss--Catalan algebras, which are generalizations of the Temperley--Lieb algebra and act on generalized Dyck paths, through non-crossing partitions. First, the Temperley--Lieb algebra is defined on non-crossing partitions, and a bijection between a Dyck path and a non-crossing partition is shown to be compatible with the Temperley--Lieb algebra on Dyck paths, or equivalently chord diagrams. We show that the Kreweras endomorphism on non-crossing partitions is equivalent to the rotation of chord diagrams under the bijection. Secondly, by considering an increasing $r$-chain in the graded lattice of non-crossing partitions, we define the Fuss--Catalan algebras on increasing $r$-chains. Through a bijection between an increasing $r$-chain and a generalized Dyck path, one naturally obtains the Fuss--Catalan algebra on generalized Dyck paths. As generalizations of the Fuss--Catalan algebra, we introduce the one- and two-boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras. Increasing $r$-chains of symmetric non-crossing partitions give symmetric generalized Dyck paths by the bijection, and the boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras naturally act on them. We show that these representations are compatible with the diagrammatic representations of the algebras by use of generalized chord diagrams. Thirdly, we discuss the integrability of the Fuss--Catalan algebras. For the Fuss--Catalan algebras with boundaries, we obtain a new solution of the reflection equation in the case of $r=2$.</description>

      <title>Oriented diameter of graphs with diameter $4$ and given maximum edge girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bridgeless graph. We introduce the maximum edge girth of $G$, denoted by $g^*(G)=\max\{l_G(e)\mid e\in E(G)\}$, where $l_G(e)$ is the edge girth of $e$, defined as the length of the shortest cycle containing $e$. Let $F(d,A)$ be the smallest value for which every bridgeless graph $G$ with diameter $d$ and $g^*(G)\in A$ admits a strong orientation $\overrightarrow{G}$ such that the diameter of $\overrightarrow{G}$ is at most $F(d,A)$. Let $f(d)=F(d,A)$, where $A=\{a\in \mathbb{N}\mid 2\leq a\leq 2d+1\}$. Chv\'atal and Thomassen (JCT-B, 1978) obtained general bounds for $f(d)$ and showed that $f(2)=6$. Kwok et al. (JCT-B, 2010) proved that $9\leq f(3)\leq 11$. Wang and Chen (JCT-B, 2022) determined $f(3)=9$. In this paper, we give that $12\leq F(4,A^*)\leq 13$, where $A^*=\{2,3,6,7,8,9\}$.</description>

      <title>Tree-indexed sums of Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of infinite sums of products of Catalan numbers, indexed by trees. We show that these sums are polynomials in $1/\pi$ with rational coefficients; the proof is effective and provides an algorithm to explicitly compute these sums. Along the way we introduce parametric liftings of our sums, and show that they are polynomials in the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. Moreover, the degrees of these polynomials are at most half of the number of vertices of the tree. The computation of these tree-indexed sums is motivated by the study of large meandric systems, which are non-crossing configurations of loops in the plane.</description>

Abstract: We construct a 3-uniform 1-degenerate hypergraph on $n$ vertices whose 2-colour Ramsey number is $\Omega\big(n^{3/2}/\log n\big)$. This shows that all remaining open cases of the hypergraph Burr-Erd\H{o}s conjecture are false. Our graph is a variant of the celebrated hedgehog graph. We additionally show near-sharp upper bounds, proving that all 3-uniform generalised hedgehogs have 2-colour Ramsey number $O\big(n^{3/2}\big)$.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s meets Nash-Williams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1847, Kirkman proved that there exists a Steiner triple system on $n$ vertices (equivalently a triangle decomposition of the edges of $K_n$) whenever $n$ satisfies the necessary divisibility conditions (namely $n\equiv 1,3 \mod 6$). In 1970, Nash-Williams conjectured that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $3n/4$ (for $n$ large enough and satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions) has a triangle decomposition. In 1973, Erd\H{o}s conjectured that for each integer $g$, there exists a Steiner triple system on $n$ vertices with girth at least $g$ (provided that $n\equiv 1,3 \mod 6$ is large enough compared to the fixed $g$). In 2021, Glock, K\"uhn, and Osthus conjectured the common generalization of these two conjectures, dubbing it the ``Erd\H{o}s meets Nash-Williams' Conjecture''.
  In this paper, we reduce the combined conjecture to the fractional relaxation of the Nash-Williams' Conjecture. Combined with the best known fractional bound of Delcourt and Postle, this proves the combined conjecture above when $G$ has minimum degree at least $0.82733n$. We note that our result generalizes the seminal work of Barber, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus on Nash-Williams' Conjecture and the resolution of Erd\H{o}s' Conjecture by Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin. Both previous proofs of those results used the method of iterative absorption. Our proof instead proceeds via the newly developed method of refined absorption (and hence provides new independent proofs of both results).</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the postage stamp problem for large numbers of stamps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h&gt;2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $\epsilon&gt;0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have \[ \left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)h!\sqrt{2\pi e} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\epsilon\right)h\right)^h n. \]</description>

      <title>Which maximal subgroups are perfect codes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma=(V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a subgroup perfect code of $G$ if it is a perfect code in some Cayley graph of $G$. In this paper, we undertake a systematic study of which maximal subgroups of a group can be perfect codes. Our approach highlights a characterization of subgroup perfect codes in terms of their ``local'' complements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing works of D'Angeli and Donno, we describe, starting from an infinite sequence over $r$ letters with $r \neq 4i$ and $i \in \mathbb{N}$, a sequence of pointed finite graphs. We study the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit graphs giving a description of isomorphim classes in terms of dihedral groups and providing insights on the horofunction boundaries in terms of Busemann and non-Busemann points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi--homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus--one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi--homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus--one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The displayed tree phylogenetic network model is shown to sit as a natural submodel of the graphical model associated to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This representation allows to derive a number of results about the displayed tree model. In particular, the concept of a local modification to a DAG model is developed and applied to the displayed tree model. As an application, some nonidentifiability issues related to the displayed tree models are highlighted as they relate to reticulation edges and stacked reticulations in the networks. We also derive rank conditions on flattenings of probability tensors for the displayed tree model, generalizing classic results for phylogenetic tree models.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider critical multitype Bienaym\'e trees that are either irreducible or possess a critical irreducible component with attached subcritical components. These trees are studied under two distinct conditioning frameworks: first, conditioning on the value of a linear combination of the numbers of vertices of given types; and second, conditioning on the precise number of vertices belonging to a selected subset of types. We prove that, under a finite exponential moment condition, the scaling limit as the tree size tends to infinity is given by the Brownian Continuum Random Tree. Additionally, we establish strong non-asymptotic tail bounds for the height of such trees. Our main tools include a flattening operation applied to multitype trees and sharp estimates regarding the structure of monotype trees with a given sequence of degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hessenberg varieties are a family of subvarieties of full flag varieties. This family contains well-known varieties such as Springer fibers, Peterson varieties, and permutohedral varieties. It was introduced by De Mari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In particular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg varieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study their cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in the full flag varieties.</description>

Abstract: Linear resolutions and the stronger notion of linear quotients are important properties of monomial ideals. In this paper, we fully characterize linear resolutions and linear quotients in terms of the lcm-lattice of monomial ideals. These results complement characterizations of these two properties in terms of the Alexander dual of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex. In addition, we discuss applications to the case of edge ideals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture claims a broad generalization of Tverberg's classical theorem. One of its consequences, the central transversal theorem, extends both the centerpoint theorem and the ham sandwich theorem. In this manuscript, we establish complex analogues of these results, where the corresponding transversals are complex affine spaces. The proofs of the complex Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture and its optimal colorful version rely on the non-vanishing of an equivariant Euler class. Furthermore, we obtain new Borsuk--Ulam-type theorems on complex Stiefel manifolds. These theorems yield complex analogues of recent extensions of the ham sandwich theorem for mass assignments by Axelrod-Freed and Sober\'on, and provide a direct proof of the complex central transversal theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the well-studied concept of graphical regular representations to bipartite graphs, a Haar graphical representation (HGR) of a group $G$ is a bipartite graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to $G$ and acts semiregularly with the orbits giving the bipartition. The question of which groups admit an HGR was inspired by a closely related question of Est\'elyi and Pisanski in 2016, as well as Babai's work in 1980 on poset representations, and has been recently solved by Morris and Spiga. In this paper, we introduce the $m$-Haar graphical representation ($m$-HGR) as a natural generalization of HGR to $m$-partite graphs for $m\geq2$, and explore the existence of $m$-HGRs for any fixed group. This inquiry represents a more robust version of the existence problem of G$m$SRs as addressed by Du, Feng and Spiga in 2020. Our main result is a complete classification of finite groups $G$ without $m$-HGRs.</description>

Abstract: Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>A note on the structure of locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an early work from 1896, Maschke established the complete list of all finite planar Cayley graphs. This result initiated a long line of research over the next century, aiming at characterizing in a similar way all planar infinite Cayley graphs. Droms (2006) proved a structure theorem for finitely generated planar groups, i.e., finitely generated groups admitting a planar Cayley graph, in terms of Bass-Serre decompositions. As a byproduct of his structure theorem, Droms proved that such groups are finitely presented. More recently, Hamann (2018) gave a graph theoretical proof that every planar quasi-transitive graph $G$ admits a generating $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$-invariant set of closed walks with only finitely many orbits, and showed that a consequence is an alternative proof of Droms' result. Based on the work of Hamann, we show in this note that we can also obtain a general structure theorem for $3$-connected locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs, namely that every such graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition whose edge-separations correspond to cycle-separations in the (unique) embedding of $G$, and in which every part admits a vertex-accumulation free embedding. This result can be seen as a version of Droms' structure theorem for quasi-transitive planar graphs. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof of a result of Hamann, Lehner, Miraftab and R\"uhmann (2022) that every locally finite quasi-transitive planar graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition, whose parts are either $1$-ended or finite planar graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of strong geometry, a structure composed by both the chirotope of a set of points X in the d-dimensional space and the wedge chirotope which is the specific adjoint chirotope induced by the hyperplanes spanned by X. We present various properties relating these two chirotopes, for instance, by introducing the witness chirotope, we are able to give a formula expressing the wedge chirotope in terms of the usual chirotope. With this on hand, we answer positively a strong geometry version of a question due to M. Las Vergnas about reconstructing polygonal knots via chirotopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky proved that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Furthermore, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</description>

      <title>Totally Disjoint 3-Digit Decimal Check Digit Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three versions of such a code that he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. This paper presents 3 pairwise disjoint 3-digit codes. The codes developed herein, have the property that the knowledge of the multiset of digits included in a word is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. Thus the codes are permutation-free, and this fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19219</link>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Verification of the Buratti--Horak--Rosa Conjecture for Small Integers and Inductive Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational approach to verify and inductively construct Hamiltonian paths for the Buratti--Horak--Rosa (BHR) Conjecture. The conjecture posits that for any multiset $L$ of $p-1$ positive integers not exceeding $\lfloor p/2 \rfloor$, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the complete graph $K_p$ with vertex-set $\{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}$ whose edge lengths (under the cyclic metric) match $L$, if and only if for every divisor $d$ of $p$, the number of multiples of $d$ appearing in $L$ is at most $p - d$.
  Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka, which verified the conjecture for all primes up to $p=23$, our Python program extends this verification significantly. We approach the problem by systematically generating frequency partitions (FPs) of edge lengths and employing a recursive backtracking algorithm. We report successful computational verification for all frequency partitions for integers $p &lt; 32$, specifically presenting results for $p=31$ and a composite $p=26$. For the composite number $p=30$, the Python code took approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. For $p=16$, $167,898$ valid multisets were processed, taking around 20 hours on Google Colab Pro+.
  Furthermore, we introduce and implement two constructive, inductive strategies for building Hamiltonian paths: (1) increasing the multiplicity of an existing edge length, and (2) adding a new edge length. These methods, supported by a reuse-insertion heuristic and backtracking search, demonstrate successful constructions for evolving FPs up to $p=40$. Through these empirical tests and performance metrics, we provide strong computational evidence for the validity of the BHR conjecture within the scope tested, and outline the scalability of our approach for higher integer values.</description>
