      <title>Transmission across a ribbon containing a square PT impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum and transmission coefficient of plane waves propagating along square ribbons of varying widths, containing a square-shaped, PT-symmetric impurity region. We start with a zero-width ribbon (1D chain) and place a PT symmetric dimer. The spectrum is computed numerically and the instability gain is computed as a function of the gain/loss dimer strength. The transmission coefficient is obtained in closed form and examined as a function of wavevector and the gain/loss parameter. Next, we study a ribbon in a narrow ladder configuration containing a square PT impurity. As before, we compute the instability gain numerically and the transmission coefficient in closed form for the two possible input modes. Finally, we repeat the calculations for a wider ladder ribbon containing a Lieb-like impurity in a PT configuration. For all cases and transmission channels, we obtain transmission divergences in wavevector-gain/loss parameter space, whose number increases with the width of the ribbon</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-AdS$_2$ dynamics arise ubiquitously near the horizon of near-extremal black holes. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- a $p$-local model of fermions -- is the first microscopic model that realizes the dual near-CFT$_1$ dynamics. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Recently, it was pointed out that such near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. We will use this insight to construct a collection of bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved charge. One class of models we wish to highlight are based on canonical bosons with conserved occupation numbers. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. Furthermore, canonical bosons allow the number densities to be arbitrarily large, which is impossible in quibt- or fermion-based constructions. This creates a larger variety of scaling regimes for the thermodynamics. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings (with respect to conserved charges) of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from, even though both are solved by chord diagrams. We also show the level statistics for both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energy.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only dynamical phase transition of topological and boundary orders in toric code and gauge-Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through a projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of symmetry-protected-topological states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos on Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles, which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of ``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems, invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense). While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely, Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the construction of holographic principles we discuss.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic generalization error of a single-layer graph convolutional network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While graph convolutional networks show great practical promises, the theoretical understanding of their generalization properties as a function of the number of samples is still in its infancy compared to the more broadly studied case of supervised fully connected neural networks. In this article, we predict the performances of a single-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) trained on data produced by attributed stochastic block models (SBMs) in the high-dimensional limit. Previously, only ridge regression on contextual-SBM (CSBM) has been considered in Shi et al. 2022; we generalize the analysis to arbitrary convex loss and regularization for the CSBM and add the analysis for another data model, the neural-prior SBM. We also study the high signal-to-noise ratio limit, detail the convergence rates of the GCN and show that, while consistent, it does not reach the Bayes-optimal rate for any of the considered cases.</description>
