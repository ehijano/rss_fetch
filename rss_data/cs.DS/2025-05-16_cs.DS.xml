      <title>A lossless a priori splitting rule for split-delivery routing problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource allocation problems in which demand is splittable are usually solved using different solution methods from their unsplittable equivalents. Although splittable problem instances can be the easier of the two (for example, they might simply correspond to a linear relaxation of a discrete problem), there exist many problems, including routing problems, for which the converse is true. That is, the technology for solving unsplittable problems is mature, but the splittable counterpart is not. For such problems, one strategy that has recently shown potential is the use of an a priori splitting rule in which each customer's demand is split into smaller pieces in advance, which enables one to simply solve the splittable problem as an instance of the unsplittable version. An important factor to consider is the number of pieces that result after this splitting. A large numbers of pieces will allow more splitting patterns to be realizable, but will result in a larger problem instance. In this paper, we introduce a splitting rule that minimizes the number of pieces, subject to the constraint that all demand splitting patterns remain feasible. Computational experiments on benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem and a time-windows extension show that the solution quality of our proposed splitting rule can match the performance of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>On Unbiased Low-Rank Approximation with Minimum Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best approximates a fixed target matrix $P\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ in the following sense: $Q$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q] = P$; $\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient unbiased sparsification problem for vectors, except applied to the singular components of the matrix $P$. Optimality is proven by showing that our algorithm matches the error from an existing lower bound.</description>

      <title>Improved Rank Aggregation under Fairness Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregating multiple input rankings into a consensus ranking is essential in various fields such as social choice theory, hiring, college admissions, web search, and databases. A major challenge is that the optimal consensus ranking might be biased against individual candidates or groups, especially those from marginalized communities. This concern has led to recent studies focusing on fairness in rank aggregation. The goal is to ensure that candidates from different groups are fairly represented in the top-$k$ positions of the aggregated ranking.
  We study this fair rank aggregation problem by considering the Kendall tau as the underlying metric. While we know of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the classical rank aggregation problem, the corresponding fair variant only possesses a quite straightforward 3-approximation algorithm due to Wei et al., SIGMOD'22, and Chakraborty et al., NeurIPS'22, which finds closest fair ranking for each input ranking and then simply outputs the best one.
  In this paper, we first provide a novel algorithm that achieves $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation (for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$), significantly improving over the 3-approximation bound. Next, we provide a $2.881$-approximation fair rank aggregation algorithm that works irrespective of the fairness notion, given one can find a closest fair ranking, beating the 3-approximation bound. We complement our theoretical guarantee by performing extensive experiments on various real-world datasets to establish the effectiveness of our algorithm further by comparing it with the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ Space Construction of Superpermutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of $n$ distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For instance, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly. This improves memory usage, enabling the construction of larger sequences previously considered impractical.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Fermionic Gibbs States are Mixtures of Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of a quantum system generally relies on structural properties of the quantum state. Motivated by the recent results by Bakshi et al. on the sudden death of entanglement in high-temperature Gibbs states of quantum spin systems, we study the high-temperature Gibbs states of bounded-degree local fermionic Hamiltonians, which include the special case of geometrically local fermionic systems. We prove that at a sufficiently high temperature that is independent of the system size, the Gibbs state is a probabilistic mixture of fermionic Gaussian states. This forms the basis of an efficient classical algorithm to prepare the Gibbs state by sampling from a distribution of fermionic Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Price of Anarchy for Congestion and Scheduling Games via Vector Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.
  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of the technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \sum w_j C_j$. In addition, this approach recovers the known tight approximation ratio of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618$ for a natural local search algorithm for $R || \sum w_j C_j$, as well as the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \sqrt{5})/4 + \varepsilon \approx 1.809 + \varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.
  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Learning-Augmented Search Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study learning-augmented binary search trees (BSTs) via Treaps with carefully designed priorities. The result is a simple search tree in which the depth of each item $x$ is determined by its predicted weight $w_x$. Specifically, each item $x$ is assigned a composite priority of $-\lfloor\log\log(1/w_x)\rfloor + U(0, 1)$ where $U(0, 1)$ is the uniform random variable. By choosing $w_x$ as the relative frequency of $x$, the resulting search trees achieve static optimality. This approach generalizes the recent learning-augmented BSTs [Lin-Luo-Woodruff ICML '22], which only work for Zipfian distributions, by extending them to arbitrary input distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be generalized to a B-Tree data structure using the B-Treap approach [Golovin ICALP '09]. Our search trees are also capable of leveraging localities in the access sequence through online self-reorganization, thereby achieving the working-set property. Additionally, they are robust to prediction errors and support dynamic operations, such as insertions, deletions, and prediction updates. We complement our analysis with an empirical study, demonstrating that our method outperforms prior work and classic data structures.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Internal Dictionary Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the internal dictionary matching (IDM) problem where a dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ containing $d$ substrings of a text $T$ is given, and each query concerns the occurrences of patterns in $\mathcal{D}$ in another substring of $T$. We propose a novel $O(n)$-sized data structure named Basic Substring Structure (BASS) where $n$ is the length of the text $T.$ With BASS, we are able to handle all types of queries in the IDM problem in nearly optimal query and preprocessing time. Specifically, our results include:
  $\bullet$ The first algorithm that answers the CountDistinct query in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n+d)$ preprocessing, where we need to compute the number of distinct patterns that exist in $T[l,r]$. Previously, the best result was $\tilde{O}(m)$ time per query after $\tilde{O}(n^2/m+d)$ or $\tilde{O}(nd/m+d)$ preprocessing, where $m$ is a chosen parameter.
  $\bullet$ Faster algorithms for two other types of internal queries. We improve the runtime for (1) Occurrence counting (Count) queries to $O(\log n/\log\log n)$ time per query with $O(n+d\sqrt{\log n})$ preprocessing from $O(\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ time per query with $O(n\log n/\log \log n+d\log^{3/2} n)$ preprocessing. (2) Distinct pattern reporting (ReportDistinct) queries to $O(1+|\text{output}|)$ time per query from $O(\log n+|\text{output}|)$ per query.
  In addition, we match the optimal runtime in the remaining two types of queries, pattern existence (Exists), and occurrence reporting (Report). We also show that BASS is more generally applicable to other internal query problems.</description>

      <title>Online Metric Matching: Beyond the Worst Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the online metric matching problem. There are $m$ servers and $n$ requests located in a metric space, where all servers are available upfront and requests arrive one at a time. Upon the arrival of a new request, it needs to be immediately and irrevocably matched to a free server, resulting in a cost of their distance. The objective is to minimize the total matching cost.
  When servers are adversarial and requests are independently drawn from a known distribution, we reduce the problem to a more accessible setting where all servers and requests are independently drawn from the same distribution. Applying our reduction, for the Euclidean space $[0, 1]^d$ with various choices of distributions, we achieve improved competitive ratios and nearly optimal regrets in both balanced and unbalanced markets. In particular, we give $O(1)$-competitive algorithms for $d \geq 3$ in both balanced and unbalanced markets with smooth distributions. Our algorithms improve on the $O((\log \log \log n)^2)$ competitive ratio of Gupta et al. (ICALP'19) for balanced markets in various regimes, and provide the first positive results for unbalanced markets.
  Moreover, when the servers and requests are adversarial and a prediction of request locations is provided, for balanced markets, we present a general framework for transforming an arbitrary algorithm that does not use predictions into an algorithm that leverages predictions. The competitive ratio of the resulting algorithm is a constant with a perfect prediction and degrades smoothly as the prediction accuracy deteriorates, while preserving the worst-case guarantee.</description>

      <title>Fully Dynamic Graph Algorithms with Edge Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study differentially private algorithms for analyzing graphs in the challenging setting of continual release with fully dynamic updates, where edges are inserted and deleted over time, and the algorithm is required to update the solution at every time step. Previous work has presented differentially private algorithms for many graph problems that can handle insertions only or deletions only (called partially dynamic algorithms) and obtained some hardness results for the fully dynamic setting. The only algorithms in the latter setting were for the edge count, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Ost (ESA 21), and for releasing the values of all graph cuts, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Upadhyay (ICML 23). We provide the first differentially private and fully dynamic graph algorithms for several other fundamental graph statistics (including the triangle count, the number of connected components, the size of the maximum matching, and the degree histogram), analyze their error and show strong lower bounds on the error for all algorithms in this setting. We study two variants of edge differential privacy for fully dynamic graph algorithms: event-level and item-level. We give upper and lower bounds on the error of both event-level and item-level fully dynamic algorithms for several fundamental graph problems. No fully dynamic algorithms that are private at the item-level (the more stringent of the two notions) were known before. In the case of item-level privacy, for several problems, our algorithms match our lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Fixed Order Scheduling with Deadlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a scheduling problem in a parallel machine setting, where each machine must adhere to a predetermined fixed order for processing the jobs. Given $n$ jobs, each with processing times and deadlines, we aim to minimize the number of machines while ensuring deadlines are met and the fixed order is maintained. We show that the first-fit algorithm solves the problem optimally with unit processing times and is a 2-approximation in the following four cases: (1) the order aligns with non-increasing slacks, (2) the order aligns with non-decreasing slacks, (3) the order aligns with non-increasing deadlines, and (4) the optimal solution uses at most 3 machines. For the general problem we provide an $O(\log n)$-approximation.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Optimal Approximation Algorithm for Multiobjective Submodular Maximization at Scale</title>

Abstract: Maximizing a single submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint is a well-studied and central topic in combinatorial optimization. However, finding a set that maximizes multiple functions at the same time is much less understood, even though it is a formulation which naturally occurs in robust maximization or problems with fairness considerations such as fair influence maximization or fair allocation.
  In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum over many submodular functions, which is known as multiobjective submodular maximization. All known polynomial-time approximation algorithms either obtain a weak approximation guarantee or rely on the evaluation of the multilinear extension. The latter is expensive to evaluate and renders such algorithms impractical. We bridge this gap and introduce the first scalable and practical algorithm that obtains the best-known approximation guarantee. We furthermore introduce a novel application fair centrality maximization and show how it can be addressed via multiobjective submodular maximization. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm outperforms known algorithms in terms of objective value and running time.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Parameter Tuning of Level-1 QAOA for Ising Models</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\gamma, \beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\gamma, \beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\gamma$, with $\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\gamma^* \in \mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.</description>

      <title>Connected Partitions via Connected Dominating Sets</title>

Abstract: The classical theorem due to Gy\H{o}ri and Lov\'{a}sz states that any $k$-connected graph $G$ admits a partition into $k$ connected subgraphs, where each subgraph has a prescribed size and contains a prescribed vertex, as long as the total size of target subgraphs is equal to the size of $G$. However, this result is notoriously evasive in terms of efficient constructions, and it is still unknown whether such a partition can be computed in polynomial time, even for $k = 5$.
  We make progress towards an efficient constructive version of the Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem by considering a natural strengthening of the $k$-connectivity requirement. Specifically, we show that the desired connected partition can be found in polynomial time, if $G$ contains $k$ disjoint connected dominating sets. As a consequence of this result, we give several efficient approximate and exact constructive versions of the original Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem:
  1. On general graphs, a Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz partition with $k$ parts can be computed in polynomial time when the input graph has connectivity $\Omega(k \cdot \log^2 n)$;
  2. On convex bipartite graphs, connectivity of $4k$ is sufficient;
  3. On biconvex graphs and interval graphs, connectivity of $k$ is sufficient, meaning that our algorithm gives a ``true'' constructive version of the theorem on these graph classes.</description>

      <title>Flexible Graph Similarity Computation With A Proactive Optimization Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) offers a principled and flexible measure of graph similarity, as it quantifies the minimum cost needed to transform one graph into another with customizable edit operation costs. Despite recent learning-based efforts to approximate GED via vector space representations, existing methods struggle with adapting to varying operation costs. Furthermore, they suffer from inefficient, reactive mapping refinements due to reliance on isolated node-level distance as guidance. To address these issues, we propose GEN, a novel learning-based approach for flexible GED approximation. GEN addresses the varying costs adaptation by integrating operation costs prior to match establishment, enabling mappings to dynamically adapt to cost variations. Furthermore, GEN introduces a proactive guidance optimization strategy that captures graph-level dependencies between matches, allowing informed matching decisions in a single step without costly iterative refinements. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GEN achieves up to 37.8% reduction in GED approximation error and 72.7% reduction in inference time compared with state-of-the-art methods, while consistently maintaining robustness under diverse cost settings and graph sizes.</description>
