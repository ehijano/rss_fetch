      <title>Sparse Signal Recovery From Quadratic Systems with Full-Rank Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In signal processing and data recovery, reconstructing a signal from quadratic measurements poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-dimensional settings where measurements $m$ is far less than the signal dimension $n$ (i.e., $m \ll n$). This paper addresses this problem by exploiting signal sparsity. Using tools from algebraic geometry, we derive theoretical recovery guarantees for sparse quadratic systems, showing that $m\ge 2s$ (real case) and $m\ge 4s-2$ (complex case) generic measurements suffice to uniquely recover all $s$-sparse signals. Under a Gaussian measurement model, we propose a novel two-stage Sparse Gauss-Newton (SGN) algorithm. The first stage employs a support-restricted spectral initialization, yielding an accurate initial estimate with $m=O(s^2\log{n})$ measurements. The second stage refines this estimate via an iterative hard-thresholding Gauss-Newton method, achieving quadratic convergence to the true signal within finitely many iterations when $m\ge O(s\log{n})$. Compared to existing second-order methods, our algorithm achieves near-optimal sampling complexity for the refinement stage without requiring resampling. Numerical experiments indicate that SGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, (1) when sparsity level $s$ is high, compared with existing algorithms, SGN can achieve the same success rate with fewer measurements. (2) SGN converges with only about $1/10$ iterations of the best existing algorithm and reach lower relative error.</description>

      <title>Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding: Optimality, Reliability, and Global Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies privacy-sensitive federated learning (FL) with unreliable communication, focusing on secure aggregation and straggler mitigation. While secure aggregation cryptographically reconstructs the global model without exposing client updates, random link failures disrupt its key coordination, degrading model accuracy. Moreover, unreliable communication can lead to objective inconsistency, causing the global model to converge to arbitrary, sub-optimal points far from the intended optimum. This paper proposes Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding (SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves secure aggregation with arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and robust straggler mitigation under unreliable communication. SecCoGC operates natively in the real field, making it directly applicable to practical deployments. To ensure equitable privacy protection across clients, we further introduce Fair-SecCoGC, an extension that enforces fairness in the level of privacy offered to all users. To conclude, this paper formally formulates the problem of secure aggregation in the real field and presents both general and computationally efficient key construction methods. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive privacy analysis under Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers. Robustness and convergence properties are also rigorously analyzed. Finally, extensive simulations are performed across diverse network conditions and benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that SecCoGC achieves strong robustness to unreliable communication under arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees. It outperforms existing privacy-preserving methods with performance gains of up to 20\%-70\%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reading channels where $b$-tuples of adjacent symbols are read at every step have e.g.\ applications in storage. Corresponding bounds and constructions of codes for the $b$-symbol metric, especially the pair-symbol metric where $b=2$, were intensively studied in the last fifteen years. Here we determine the optimal code parameters of linear codes in the $b$-symbol metric assuming that the minimum distance is sufficiently large. We also determine the optimal parameters of linear binary codes in the pair-symbol metric for small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized bilateral multilevel construction for constant dimension codes from parallel mixed dimension construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant dimension codes (CDCs), as special subspace codes, have received extensive attention due to their applications in random network coding. The basic problem of CDCs is to determine the maximal possible size $A_q(n,d,\{k\})$ for given parameters $q, n, d$, and $k$. This paper introduces criteria for choosing appropriate bilateral identifying vectors compatible with the parallel mixed dimension construction (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 93(1):227--241, 2025). We then utilize the generalized bilateral multilevel construction (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 93(1):197--225, 2025) to improve the parallel mixed dimension construction efficiently. Many new CDCs that are better than the previously best-known codes are constructed.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in RIS-Aided Networks: Active or Nearly-Passive RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization in RIS-aided wireless networks. The use of active and nearly-passive RISs are compared and their trade-off in terms of SEE is analyzed. Considering both perfect and statistical channel state information, two SEE maximization algorithms are developed to optimize the transmit powers of the mobile users, the RIS reflection coefficients, and the base station receive filters. Numerical results quantify the trade-off between active and nearly-passive RISs in terms of SEE, with active RISs yielding worse SEE values as the static power consumed by each reflecting element increases.</description>

      <title>Discrete Beamforming Optimization for RISs with a Limited Phase Range and Amplitude Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains, regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Optical OFDM Systems with Clipping Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping. This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe clipping distortion conditions.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Large-Sample Majorization of Pairs of Flat States in Terms of $\alpha$-$z$ Relative Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we offer the first operational interpretation of the $\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies, which were introduced by Jak\v{s}i\'{c} {\it et al.} \cite{Jaksic2012} and Audenaert and Datta \cite{Audenaert_Datta_2015}, where the $\alpha$ and $z$ parameters are truly independent from each other. Namely, we show that these relative entropies appear in the conditions for large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and certain generalizations of them. Additionally, the optimal rate of converting one such pair into another may be formulated in terms of the $\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator. The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a novel trace inequality involving two operators. As applications, we sharpen the one-shot achievability bound on the relative entropy error in a wealth of quantum covering-type problems, such as soft covering, privacy amplification, convex splitting, quantum information decoupling, and quantum channel simulation by removing some dimension-dependent factors. Moreover, the established one-shot bounds extend to infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces as well. The proof techniques are based on the recently developed operator layer cake theorem and an operator change-of-variable argument, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs among Action Taking Policies Matter in Active Sequential Multi-Hypothesis Testing: the Optimal Error Exponent Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability of sequential hypothesis testing can be greatly improved when the decision maker is given the freedom to adaptively take an action that determines the distribution of the current collected sample. Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff's seminal paper in 1959 [1]. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the ``action'' at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the $M$ hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents in active sequential hypothesis testing, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff [1].</description>

      <title>Estimation Error: Distribution and Pointwise Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the distribution and convergence properties of the estimation error $W = X - \hat{X}(Y)$, where $\hat{X}(Y)$ is the Bayesian estimator of a random variable $X$ from a noisy observation $Y = X +\sigma Z$ where $\sigma$ is the parameter indicating the strength of noise $Z$. Using the conditional expectation framework (that is, $\hat{X}(Y)$ is the conditional mean), we define the normalized error $\mathcal{E}_\sigma = \frac{W}{\sigma}$ and explore its properties.
  Specifically, in the first part of the paper, we characterize the probability density function of $W$ and $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$. Along the way, we also find conditions for the existence of the inverse functions for the conditional expectations. In the second part, we study pointwise (i.e., almost sure) convergence of $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$ as $\sigma \to 0$ under various assumptions about the noise and the underlying distributions. Our results extend some of the previous limits of $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$ as $\sigma \to 0$ studied under the $L^2$ convergence, known as the \emph{mmse dimension}, to the pointwise case.</description>

Abstract: Token communications is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and transformer-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as ToDMA, where a large number of devices share a tokenizer and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, the source signal is tokenized into sequences, with each token modulated into a codeword. Codewords from multiple devices are transmitted simultaneously, resulting in overlap at the receiver. The receiver detects the transmitted tokens, assigns them to their respective sources, and mitigates token collisions by leveraging context and semantic orthogonality across the devices' messages. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed ToDMA framework outperforms context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods in image transmission tasks, achieving lower latency and better image quality.</description>

      <title>Sensing Rate Optimization for Multi-Band Cooperative ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies for future wireless networks, which potentially need to operate in multiple frequency bands to satisfy ever-increasing demands for both communication and sensing services. Motivated by this, we consider the sum sensing rate (SR) optimization for a cooperative ISAC system with linear precoding, where each base station (BS) works in a different frequency band. With this aim, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite rank relaxation that introduces covariance matrices as optimization variables, and we apply the inner approximation (IA) method to deal with the nonconvexity of the resulting problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the SR by approximately 25 % and 40 % compared to the case of equal power distribution in a cooperative ISAC system with two and three BSs, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm converges in only a few iterations, while its most beneficial implementation scenario is in the low power regime</description>

      <title>Radiation Footprint Control in Cell-Free Cooperative ISAC: Optimal Joint BS Activation and Beamforming Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated beamforming across distributed base stations (BSs) in cell-free wireless infrastructure can efficiently support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users by enhancing resource sharing and suppressing interference in the spatial domain. However, intensive coordination among distributed BSs within the ISAC-enabled network poses risks of generating substantial interference to other coexisting networks sharing the same spectrum, while also incurring elevated costs from energy consumption and signaling exchange. To address these challenges, this paper develops an interference-suppressed and cost-efficient cell-free ISAC network, which opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrates distributed radio resources to accommodate the competing demands of sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) services. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging channel knowledge signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&amp;C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Shapley-Based Data Valuation with Mutual Information: A Key to Modified K-Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is widely used for classification and regression; however, it suffers from limitations, including the equal treatment of all samples. We propose Information-Modified KNN (IM-KNN), a novel approach that leverages Mutual Information ($I$) and Shapley values to assign weighted values to neighbors, thereby bridging the gap in treating all samples with the same value and weight. On average, IM-KNN improves the accuracy, precision, and recall of traditional KNN by 16.80%, 17.08%, and 16.98%, respectively, across 12 benchmark datasets. Experiments on four large-scale datasets further highlight IM-KNN's robustness to noise, imbalanced data, and skewed distributions.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of discrete entropy for log-concave random vectors on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the following type of discrete entropy monotonicity for sums of isotropic, log-concave, independent and identically distributed random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$: $$ H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n+1}) \geq H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n}) + \frac{d}{2}\log{\Bigl(\frac{n+1}{n}\Bigr)} +o(1), $$ where $o(1)$ vanishes as $H(X_1) \to \infty$. Moreover, for the $o(1)$-term, we obtain a rate of convergence $ O\Bigl({H(X_1)}{e^{-\frac{1}{d}H(X_1)}}\Bigr)$, where the implied constants depend on $d$ and $n$. This generalizes to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ the one-dimensional result of the second named author (2023). As in dimension one, our strategy is to establish that the discrete entropy $H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n})$ is close to the differential (continuous) entropy $h(X_1+U_1+\cdots+X_{n}+U_{n})$, where $U_1,\dots, U_n$ are independent and identically distributed uniform random vectors on $[0,1]^d$ and to apply the theorem of Artstein, Ball, Barthe and Naor (2004) on the monotonicity of differential entropy. In fact, we show this result under more general assumptions than log-concavity, which are preserved up to constants under convolution. In order to show that log-concave distributions satisfy our assumptions in dimension $d\ge2$, more involved tools from convex geometry are needed because a suitable position is required. We show that, for a log-concave function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in isotropic position, its integral, barycenter and covariance matrix are close to their discrete counterparts. Moreover, in the log-concave case, we weaken the isotropicity assumption to what we call almost isotropicity. One of our technical tools is a discrete analogue to the upper bound on the isotropic constant of a log-concave function, which extends to dimensions $d\ge1$ a result of Bobkov, Marsiglietti and Melbourne (2022).</description>

      <title>Information-driven design of imaging systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern imaging systems that computationally process raw measurements before or instead of human viewing, information content matters more than visual appearance. However, developing information estimators that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating mutual information between unknown objects and their noisy measurements. Our technique fits probabilistic models to measurements and their noise processes, quantifying information content without requiring ground truth data or making assumptions about object structure. We validate our approach across diverse applications-color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy-demonstrating that information estimates reliably predict system performance. Finally, we introduce Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL), which optimizes imaging systems to maximize information capture. Our work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Personalised Mean Estimation for the Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning with heterogeneous data and personalization has received significant recent attention. Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the context of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore combining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a constant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm whose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted samples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Layer Cake Representations for Quantum Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining suitable quantum extensions of classical divergences often poses a challenge due to the non-commutative nature of quantum information. In this work, we propose a new approach via what we call the layer cake representation. The resulting quantum R\'enyi and $f$-divergences are then proven to be equivalent to those recently defined via integral representations. Nevertheless, the approach can provide several insights. We give an alternative proof of the integral representation of the relative entropy by Frenkel and prove a conjecture regarding a trace expression for the R\'enyi divergence. Additionally, we give applications to error exponents in hypothesis testing, a new Riemann-Stieltjes type integral representation and a variational representation.</description>
