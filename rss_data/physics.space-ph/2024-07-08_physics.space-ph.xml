      <title>Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment in MHD Turbulence: Insights into Intermittency, Compressibility, and Imbalance Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment (SDDA) in Els\"asser field fluctuations is theorized to suppress nonlinearities and modulate the energy spectrum. Limited empirical evidence exists for SDDA within the solar wind turbulence's inertial range. We analyzed data from the WIND mission to assess the effects of compressibility, intermittency, and imbalance on SDDA. SDDA consistently appears at energy-containing scales, with a trend toward misalignment at inertial scales. Compressible fluctuations show no increased alignment; however, their impact on SDDA's overall behavior is minimal. The alignment angles inversely correlate with field gradient intensity, likely due to "anomalous" or "counterpropagating" wave packet interactions. This suggests that SDDA originates from mutual shearing of Els\"asser fields during imbalanced ($\delta \boldsymbol{z}^{\pm} \gg \delta \boldsymbol{z}^{\mp}$) interactions. Rigorous thresholding on field gradient intensity reveals SDDA signatures across much of the inertial range. The scaling of Els\"asser increments' alignment angle, $\Theta^{z}$, steepens with increasing global Alfv\'enic imbalance, while the angle between magnetic and velocity field increments, $\Theta^{ub}$, becomes shallower. $\Theta^{ub}$ only correlates with global Els\"asser imbalance, steepening as the imbalance increases. Furthermore, increasing alignment in $\Theta^{ub}$ persists deep into the inertial range of balanced intervals but collapses at large scales for imbalanced ones. Simplified theoretical analysis and modeling of high-frequency, low-amplitude noise in the velocity field indicate significant impacts on alignment angle measurements even at very low frequencies, with effects growing as global imbalance increases.</description>

      <title>The evaluation of the CUSP scientific performance by a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It is approved for a Phase B study. In this work, we report on the accurate simulation of the detector's response to evaluate the scientific performance. A GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. Using this approach, we implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model. In this work, we report on the evaluation of the detector's effective area as a function of the beam energy.</description>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project aims to develop a constellation of two CubeSats orbiting the Earth to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter on board of each satellite. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures. CUSP is a project approved for a Phase B study by the Italian Space Agency in the framework of the Alcor program aimed to develop CubeSat technologies and missions. In this paper we describe the a method for a multi-physical simulation analysis while analyzing some possible design optimization of the payload design solutions adopted. In particular, we report the mechanical design for each structural component, the results of static and dynamic finite element analysis, the preliminary thermo-mechanical analysis for two specific thermal cases (hot and cold orbit) and a topological optimization of the interface between the platform and the payload.</description>

      <title>Kappa-tail technique: Modeling and application to Solar Energetic Particles observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy-flux spectra and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation, (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case-study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for a SEP event observed on April 17, 2021, by the PSP/ISOIS instrument suite onboard PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of $\sim 1$ MeV and $ \sim 5 \cdot 10^{-7} $ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>When the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods do not coincide: the impact of post-Keplerian perturbing accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a purely Keplerian picture, the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods of a test particle orbiting a massive body coincide with each other. Such a degeneracy is removed when a post-Keplerian perturbing acceleration enters the equations of motion yielding generally different corrections to the Keplerian period for the three aforementioned characteristic orbital timescales. They are analytically worked out in the case of the accelerations induced by the general relativistic post-Newtonian gravitoelectromagnetic fields and, to the Newtonian level, by the oblateness of the central body as well. The resulting expressions hold for completely general orbital configurations and spatial orientations of the spin axis of the primary. Astronomical systems characterized by extremely accurate measurements of the orbital periods like, e.g., transiting exoplanets and binary pulsars, may offer potentially viable scenarios for measuring such post--Keplerian features of motion, at least in principle. As an example, the sidereal period of the brown dwarf WD1032 + 011 b is currently known with an uncertainty as small as $\simeq 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{s}$, while its predicted post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction amounts to $0.07\,\mathrm{s}$; however, the accuracy with which the Keplerian period can be calculated is just 572 s. For the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the largest relativistic correction to the anomalistic period amounts to a few tenths of a second, given a measurement error of such a characteristic orbital timescale as small as $\simeq 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{s}$. On the other hand, the Keplerian term can be currently calculated just to a $\simeq 9$ s accuracy. In principle, measuring at least two of the three characteristic orbital periods for the same system independently would allow to cancel out their common Keplerian component provided that their difference is taken.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>
