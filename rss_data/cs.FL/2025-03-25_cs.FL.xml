      <title>On the Completeness and Ordering of Path-Complete Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with path-complete barrier functions which offer a graph-based methodology for verifying safety properties in switched systems. The path-complete framework leverages algebraic (barrier functions) as well as combinatorial (graph) components to characterize a set of safety conditions for switched systems, thus offering high flexibility (two degrees of freedom) in searching for suitable safety certificates. In this paper, we do not propose any new safety criteria. Instead, we further investigate the role that the combinatorial component plays in the safety verification problem. First, we prove that path-completeness, which is a property on a graph that describes the switching sequences, is necessary to obtain a set of valid safety conditions. As a result, the path-complete framework is able to provide a complete characterization of safety conditions for switched systems. Furthermore, we provide a systematic methodology for comparing two path-complete graphs and the conservatism associated with the resulting safety conditions. Specifically, we prove that under some conditions, such as when there exists a simulation relation between two path-complete graphs, it is possible to conclude that one graph is always able to provide less conservative safety conditions than another, independent of the algebraic properties of the switched system and the template of the barrier function under consideration. Such a result paves the way for a systematic use of the path-complete frame- work with barrier functions, as one can then consistently choose the appropriate graph that provides less conservative safety conditions.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth International Workshop on Graph Computation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19632</link>

Abstract: This volume contains the post-proceedings of the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth International Workshops on Graph Computation Models (GCM 2023 and 2024). The workshops took place in Leicester, UK on 18th July 2023 and Enschede, the Netherlands on 9th July 2024, in each case as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). 
  Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas. </description>

      <title>LTL-Constrained Policy Optimization with Cycle Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offers a precise means for constraining the behavior of reinforcement learning agents. However, in many settings where both satisfaction and optimality conditions are present, LTL is insufficient to capture both. Instead, LTL-constrained policy optimization, where the goal is to optimize a scalar reward under LTL constraints, is needed. This constrained optimization problem proves difficult in deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) settings, where learned policies often ignore the LTL constraint due to the sparse nature of LTL satisfaction. To alleviate the sparsity issue, we introduce Cycle Experience Replay (CyclER), a novel reward shaping technique that exploits the underlying structure of the LTL constraint to guide a policy towards satisfaction by encouraging partial behaviors compliant with the constraint. We provide a theoretical guarantee that optimizing CyclER will achieve policies that satisfy the LTL constraint with near-optimal probability. We evaluate CyclER in three continuous control domains. Our experimental results show that optimizing CyclER in tandem with the existing scalar reward outperforms existing reward-shaping methods at finding performant LTL-satisfying policies.</description>
