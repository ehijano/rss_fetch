      <title>Fundamental Notions of Projective and Scale-Translation-Invariant Metrics in Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective metrics on vector spaces over finite fields, introduced by Gabidulin and Simonis in 1997, generalize classical metrics in coding theory like the Hamming metric, rank metric, and combinatorial metrics. While these specific metrics have been thoroughly investigated, the overarching theory of projective metrics has remained underdeveloped since their introduction. In this paper, we present and develop the foundational theory of projective metrics, establishing several elementary key results on their characterizing properties, equivalence classes, isometries, constructions, connections with the Hamming metric, associated matroids, sphere sizes and Singleton-like bounds. Furthermore, some general aspects of scale-translation-invariant metrics are examined, with particular focus on their embeddings into larger projective metric spaces.</description>

      <title>On lattice coverings by several classes of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, O. Ordentlich, O. Regev and B. Weiss made a breakthrough that the lattice covering density of any $n$-dimensional convex body is bounded by $cn^{2}$, improving on the best previous bound established by C.A. Rogers. However, for the Euclidean ball, C.A. Rogers obtained a better upper bound $n(log_{e}n)^{c}$, and this result was extended to certain symmetric convex bodies by P. Gritzmann. In this paper, we show that such bound can be achieved for more general classes of convex bodies without symmetry. We proved that for any $n$-dimensional quarter-convex body $F_{n}$ and any $n$-dimensional polytope $P$ with $n+2$ vertices, the lattice covering densities satisfy $$\theta_{L}(F_{n}),\theta_{L}(P)\leq cn(\log_{e}n)^{1+\log_{2}e}.$$ The constant $c$ above is independent on $n$.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Merging Metric Spaces using Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X_1,d_1),\dots, (X_N,d_N)$ be metric spaces with respective distance functions $d_i: X_i \times X_i \rightarrow [0,1]$, $i=1,\dots,N$. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set theoretic product $X_1\times \cdots \times X_N$ and let $\mathbf{g} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$ denote two elements in this product space. Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertices $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$ and with a positive weight $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}, p_{ij}\in (0, 1], i,j = 1,..,N$ associated with each edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{G}$. We define the function \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right). \end{align*} In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$ and we investigate the properties of this distance under graph operations, which includes disjoint unions and cartesian products. We show two limiting cases: (a) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defined over a finite field leads to a broad generalization of graph-based distances that is widely studied in the theory of error-correcting codes; and (b) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is extended to measuring distances over graphons.</description>

      <title>Generalised Erd\H{o}s distance theory on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Erd\H{o}s distinct distances problem asks the following: how many distinct distances must exist between a set of $n$ points in the plane? There are many generalisations of this question that ask one to consider different spaces and metrics, or larger structures of points. We bring these problems into a common framework using the concept of $g$-rigidity. Specifically, if $G=(V,E)$ is a (hyper)graph, $g$ is a map assigning polynomial measurements to the edges of $G$ and $f_{g,G}(P^V)$ gives the set of $g$-distinct realisations of the $g$-rigid graph $G$, where vertices must lie in a point set $P$, our main results describe sharp lower bounds for the size of $\big|f_{g,G}(P^V)\big|$. This allows us to obtain results for pseudo-Euclidean metrics, $\ell_p$ metrics, dot-product problems, matrix completion problems, and symmetric tensor completion problems.
  In addition, we use the recent work of Alon, Buci\'c and Sauermann along with a simple colouring argument to prove that the number of $\| \cdot\|$-distinct realisations of a graph $G=(V,E)$ within a $d$-dimensional point set $P$ is at least $\Omega\left(\frac{|P|^{|V|-1}}{(\log |P|)^2} \right)$ for almost all $d$-norms. Our methods here also provide a short proof that the unit distance conjecture implies the pinned distance conjecture.</description>

      <title>Equicovering masses in the Euclidean plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic mass partition results are about dividing the plane into regions that are equal with respect to one or more measures (masses). We introduce a new concept in which the notion of partition is replaced by that of a cover. In this case we require (almost) every point in the plane to be covered the same number of times. If all elements of this cover are equal with respect to the given masses, we refer to them as equicoverings.
  To construct equicoverings, we study a natural generalization of $k$-fan partitions, which we call spiral equicoverings. Like $k$-fans, these consist of wedges centered at a common point, but arranged in a way that allows overlapping. Our main result nearly characterizes all reduced positive rational numbers $p/q$ for which there exists a covering by $q$ convex wedges such that every point is covered exactly $p$ times. The proofs use results about centerpoints and combine tools from classical mass partition results, and elementary number theory.</description>

      <title>All Polyhedral Manifolds are Connected by a 2-Step Refolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any two polyhedral manifolds $\mathcal P, \mathcal Q$, there is a polyhedral manifold $\mathcal I$ such that $\mathcal P, \mathcal I$ share a common unfolding and $\mathcal I,\mathcal Q$ share a common unfolding. In other words, we can unfold $\mathcal P$, refold (glue) that unfolding into $\mathcal I$, unfold $\mathcal I$, and then refold into $\mathcal Q$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal P, \mathcal Q$ have no boundary and can be embedded in 3D (without self-intersection), then so does $\mathcal I$. These results generalize to $n$ given manifolds $\mathcal P_1, \mathcal P_2, \dots, \mathcal P_n$; they all have a common unfolding with the same intermediate manifold $\mathcal I$. Allowing more than two unfold/refold steps, we obtain stronger results for two special cases: for doubly covered convex planar polygons, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are planar; and for tree-shaped polycubes, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are tree-shaped polycubes.</description>

      <title>Metrics for quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic system originating in knot theory, which can be regarded as a generalization of the conjugation of groups. This structure naturally defines two subgroups of its automorphism group, which are called the inner automorphism group and the displacement group, and they act on the quandle from the right. For a quandle with such groups being finitely generated, we investigate the graph structures induced from the actions, and induced metric spaces. The graph structures are defined by the notion of the Schreier graph, which is a natural generalization of the Cayley graph for a group. In particular, the metric associated with the displacement group for an important class of quandles, namely, generalized Alexander quandles, is studied in detail. We show that such a metric space is quasi-isometric to the displacement group with a word metric. Finally, we provide some examples quasi-isometric to typical metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Steinitz theorem and polarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Steinitz theorem asserts that if the origin lies within the interior of the convex hull of a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, then there are at most $2d$ points in $S$ whose convex hull contains the origin within its interior. B\'ar\'any, Katchalski, and Pach established a quantitative version of Steinitz's theorem, showing that for a convex polytope $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ containing the standard Euclidean unit ball $\mathbf{B}^d$, there exist at most $2d$ vertices of $Q$ whose convex hull $Q'$ satisfies $r\mathbf{B}^d \subset Q' $ with $r \geq d^{-2d}$. Recently, M\'arton Nasz\'odi and the author derived a polynomial bound on $r$.
  This paper aims to establish a bound on $r$ based on the number of vertices of $Q.$
  In other words, we demonstrate an effective method to remove several points from the original set $Q$ without significantly altering the bound on $r$. Specifically, if the number of vertices of $Q$ scales linearly with the dimension, i.e., $\alpha d$, then one can select $2d$ vertices such that $r \geq \frac{1}{5 \alpha d}$. The proof relies on a polarity trick, which may be of independent interest: we demonstrate the existence of a point $c$ in the interior of a convex polytope $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that the vertices of the polar polytope $(P-c)^\circ$ sum up to zero.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a) the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b) Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case is generalized to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric spaces bring a natural quasi-uniformity (resp. quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.</description>

      <title>On boundaries of bicombable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate systematic study of EZ-structures (and associated boundaries) of groups acting on spaces that admit consistent and conical (equivalently, consistent and convex) geodesic bicombings. Such spaces recently drew a lot of attention due to the fact that many classical groups act `nicely' on them. We rigorously construct EZ-structures, discuss their uniqueness (up to homeomorphism), provide examples, and prove some boundary-related features analogous to the ones exhibited by CAT(0) spaces and groups, which form a subclass of the discussed class of spaces and groups.</description>
