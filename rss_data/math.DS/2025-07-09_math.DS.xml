      <title>Application of operator inference to reduced-order modeling of constrained mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained mechanical systems occur in many applications, such as modeling of robots and other multibody systems. In this case, the motion is governed by a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), often with large and sparse system matrices. The problem dimension strongly influences the effectiveness of simulations for system analysis, optimization, and control, given limited computational resources. Therefore, we aim to obtain a simplified surrogate model with a few degrees of freedom that is able to accurately represent the motion and other important properties of the original high-dimensional DAE model. Classical model reduction methods intrusively exploit the system matrices to construct the projection of the high-fidelity model onto a low-dimensional subspace. In practice, the dynamical equations are frequently an inaccessible part of proprietary software products. In this work, we show an application of the non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) method to DAE systems of index 2 and 3. Considering the fact that for proper DAEs there exists an ODE realization on the so-called hidden manifold, the OpInf optimization problem directly provides the underlying ODE representation of the given DAE system in the reduced subspace. A significant advantage is that only the DAE solution snapshots in a compressed form are required for identification of the reduced system matrices. Stability and interpretability of the reduced-order model is guaranteed by enforcing the symmetric positive definite structure of the system operators using semidefinite programming. The numerical results demonstrate the implementation of the proposed methodology for different examples of constrained mechanical systems, tested for various loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Dense and comeager conjugacy classes in zero-dimensional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group. We consider the Polish space of all actions of $G$ on the Cantor space by homeomorphisms and study the existence of a comeager conjugacy class in this space and some natural subspaces. We also develop a general model-theoretic framework to study this and related questions.
  We prove that for a finitely generated free group, there is a comeager conjugacy class in the space of minimal actions, as well as in the space of minimal, probability measure-preserving actions. We also identify the two classes: the first one is the Fra\"iss\'e limit of all sofic minimal subshifts and the second, the universal profinite action. In the opposite direction, if $G$ is an amenable group which is not finitely generated, we show that there is no comeager conjugacy class in the space of all actions and if $G$ is locally finite, also in the space of minimal actions.
  Finally, we study the question of existence of a dense conjugacy class in the space of topologically transitive actions. We show that if $G$ is free or virtually polycyclic, then such a dense conjugacy class exists iff $G$ is virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Archetype Analysis: Autonomous Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of neural computation aims to understand the function of a neural system as an information processing machine. Neural systems are undoubtedly complex, necessitating principled and automated tools to abstract away details to organize and incrementally build intuition. We argue that systems with the same effective behavior should be abstracted by their ideal representative, i.e., archetype, defined by its asymptotic dynamical structure. We propose a library of archetypical computations and a new measure of dissimilarity that allows us to group systems based on their effective behavior by explicitly considering both deformations that break topological conjugacy as well as diffeomorphisms that preserve it. The proposed dissimilarity can be estimated from observed trajectories. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method's ability to overcome previously reported fragility of existing (dis)similarity measures for approximate continuous attractors and high-dimensional recurrent neural networks. Although our experiments focus on working memory systems, our theoretical approach naturally extends to general mechanistic interpretation of recurrent dynamics in both biological and artificial neural systems. We argue that abstract dynamical archetypes, rather than detailed dynamical systems, offer a more useful vocabulary for describing neural computation.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation in dynamic problems with seasonal succession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bifurcation structure of equilibria in a class of non-autonomous ordinary differential equations governed by a season length parameter, $\tau$, which determines the alternation between growth and decline dynamics. This structure models biological systems exhibiting seasonal variation, such as insect population dynamics or infectious disease transmission.
  Using the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, we establish the existence of a critical threshold $\tau^*$ at which a bifurcation from the extinction equilibrium occurs. We also explore the emergence of secondary bifurcations from, in general, explicitly unknown non-trivial equilibria which can only be treated numerically.
  Our results are illustrated with a two-species competitive Lotka-Volterra model for the growth season and a Malthusian model for the decline season for which primary and secondary bifurcations may be computed analytically, allowing the validation of numerical approximations.
  Our analysis shows how seasonality drives transitions between extinction of both populations, of only one, and coexistence of both populations.</description>

      <title>The problem of infinite Spin for parabolic and collision solutions in the planar $n$-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the planar $n$-body problem, the problem of infinite spin occurs for both parabolic and collision solutions. Recently Moeckel and Montgomery \cite{MM25} showed that there is no infinite spin for total collision solutions. Following their approach, we show it can not happen for both complete and partially parabolic solutions. Our approach also allows us to generalize Moeckel and Montgomery's result to partial collision solutions.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of self-similar measures and sets with common fixed point structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hausdorff dimension of self-similar measures and sets on the real line, where the generating iterated function system consists of some maps that share the same fixed point. In particular, we will show that out of a Hausdorff co-dimension one exceptional set of natural parameters, such systems satisfy a weak exponential separation. This significantly strengthens the previous result of the first author and Szv\'ak. As an application, we give the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine measures supported on the generalised 4-corner set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under natural assumptions on the observable, we prove a Central Limit Theorem, a Berry-Esseen Theorem, and a quantitative Local Limit Theorem for a broad class of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus. Our results apply, but are not limited to, skew-products and their perturbations, and they remain valid even when the system admits multiple, though finitely many, absolutely continuous ergodic invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous computation of whiskered tori and their whiskers in Hamiltonian systems using flow maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider autonomous Hamiltonian systems and present an algorithm to compute at the same time partially hyperbolic invariant tori (whiskered tori), as well as high-order expansions of their stable and unstable manifolds. Such whiskered tori have been shown to be important for transport phenomena in phase space. For instance, by following their invariant manifolds one could obtain zero-cost trajectories in space mission design. We present in detail the case when the (un)stable directions are one-dimensional. The strategy to compute tori and their invariant manifolds is based on the parameterization method. We formulate a functional equation for a parameterization of both the torus and its whiskers expressing that they are invariant. This equation is naturally discretized in Fourier-Taylor series or, equivalently, in a grid of Taylor series. Using a return map, we are reduced to study functions of n - 1 variables where n is the number of degrees of freedom (the phase space is 2n dimensional). Then, we implement a Newton-like method that converges quadratically. They key advantage of our approach is that, using geometric identities coming from the Hamiltonian nature of the problem, the algorithm has small storage requirements and a low operation count per step which is highly efficient. The simultaneous computation of the torus and the whiskers improves the efficiency and the stability of the algorithm. We present implementations and extensive numerical experiments in the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem.</description>

Abstract: We compute the first and second moment formulas for Siegel transforms related to problems counting primitive lattice points in the real plane with congruence conditions. As applications, we derive an analog of Schmidt's random counting theorem and the quantitative Khintchine theorem for irrational numbers, approximated by rational numbers $p/q$, where we place a congruence-conditional constraint on the vector $(p,q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on work of Doyle and Hyde on polynomial maps in one variable, we produce for each odd integer $d \geq 2$ a H\'enon map of degree $d$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with at least $(d-4)^2$ integral periodic points. This provides a quadratic lower bound on any conjectural uniform bound for periodic rational points of H\'enon maps. In contrast with the work of Doyle and Hyde, our examples also admit integer cycles of large period.</description>

      <title>New Lie systems from Goursat distributions: reductions and reconstructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>

      <title>Adapted Measures for Markov Interval Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapted invariant measures, such as the natural area measure (Liouville), have a central place in the development of ergodic theory for billiards. These measures ensure local Pesin charts can be constructed almost everywhere even in the nonuniformly hyperbolic setting. Recently, for Sinai billiards satisfying certain conditions, the unique measure of maximal entropy has been shown to be adapted. However, not all positive entropy measures are. To investigate the connection between entropy and adaptedness, we examine Markov interval maps with exactly one singularity. We prove that a condition relating the entropy of the map and the "strength" of the singularity determines if the measure of maximal entropy is adapted with respect to this singularity. We also show that under a H\"{o}lder condition, recurrence of the singularity is necessary to have nonadapted invariant measures.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Weighted approximation for limsup sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theorems of Khintchine, Groshev, Jarn\'ik, and Besicovitch in Diophantine approximation are fundamental results on the metric properties of $\Psi$-well approximable sets. These foundational results have since been generalised to the framework of weighted Diophantine approximation for systems of real linear forms (matrices). In this article, we prove analogues of these weighted results in a range of settings including the $p$-adics (Theorems 7 and 8), complex numbers (Theorems 9 and 10), quaternions (Theorems 11 and 12), and formal power series (Theorems 13 and 14). The key tools in proving the main parts of these results are the weighted ubiquitous systems and weighted mass transference principle introduced recently by Kleinbock--Wang [Adv. Math. (2023)] and Wang--Wu [Math. Ann. (2021)].</description>

      <title>Analysis and experiments of the dissipative Twistcar: direction reversal and asymptotic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underactuated wheeled vehicles are commonly studied as nonholonomic systems with periodic actuation. Twistcar is a classical example inspired by a riding toy, which has been analyzed using a planar model of a dynamical system with nonholonomic constraints. Most of the previous analyses did not account for energy dissipation due to frictional resistance. In this work, we study a theoretical two-link model of the Twistcar while incorporating dissipation due to rolling resistance. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the system's small-amplitude steady-state periodic dynamics, which reveals the possibility of reversing the direction of motion upon varying the geometric and mass properties of the vehicle. Next, we design and construct a robotic prototype of the Twistcar whose center-of-mass position can be shifted by adding and removing a massive block, enabling experimental demonstration of the Twistcar's direction reversal phenomenon. We also conduct parameter fitting for the frictional resistance in order to improve agreement with experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices'', an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>
