      <title>Quantifying multifractal anisotropy in two dimensional objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient method of exploring the effects of anisotropy in the fractal properties of 2D surfaces and images is proposed. It can be viewed as a direction-sensitive generalization of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) into 2D. It is tested on synthetic structures to ensure its effectiveness, with results indicating consistency. The interdisciplinary potential of this method in describing real surfaces and images is demonstrated, revealing previously unknown directional multifractality in data sets from the Martian surface and the Crab Nebula. The multifractal characteristics of Jackson Pollock's paintings are also analyzed. The results point to their evolution over the time of creation of these works.</description>

      <title>An open problem: Why are motif-avoidant attractors so rare in asynchronous Boolean networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous Boolean networks are a type of discrete dynamical system in which each variable can take one of two states, and a single variable state is updated in each time step according to pre-selected rules. Boolean networks are popular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological phenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model phenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces (inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological applications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one correspondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant attractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.
  MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several novel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and linear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an ensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological systems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings quantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological models), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into the dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in sparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs. Motivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of delays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>
