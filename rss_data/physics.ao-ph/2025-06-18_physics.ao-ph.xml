      <title>Functional data decomposition reveals unexpectedly strong soil moisture-precipitation coupling over the Great Plains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil moisture-precipitation coupling (SMPC) plays a critical role in Earth's water and energy cycles but remains difficult to quantify due to synoptic-scale variability and the complex interplay of land-atmosphere processes. Here, we apply high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) to functionally decompose the structural, correlative, and cooperative contributions of key land-atmosphere variables to precipitation. Benchmark tests confirm that HDMR overcomes limitations of commonly used correlation and regression approaches in isolating direct versus indirect effects. For example, analysis of gross primary productivity using a light-use-efficiency model shows that linear regression underestimates the temperature effect, while HDMR captures it accurately. Applying HDMR to CONUS404 reanalysis data reveals that morning soil moisture explains up to 40 percent of the variance in summertime afternoon precipitation over the Great Plains, more than double prior estimates. On days with afternoon rainfall (12-hour totals of 4.7-8.2 mm), first-order SM effects can boost precipitation by up to 8 mm under wet conditions, with an additional 3 mm from second-order interactions involving temperature and moisture. By capturing real-world co-variability and higher-order effects, HDMR provides a physically grounded, data-driven framework for diagnosing land-atmosphere coupling. These results underscore the need for more nuanced, interaction-aware data analysis methods in climate modeling and prediction.</description>

      <title>Projecting U.S. coastal storm surge risks and impacts with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storm surge is one of the deadliest hazards posed by tropical cyclones (TCs), yet assessing its current and future risk is difficult due to the phenomenon's rarity and physical complexity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence applications to natural hazard modeling suggest a new avenue for addressing this problem. We utilize a deep learning storm surge model to efficiently estimate coastal surge risk in the United States from 900,000 synthetic TC events, accounting for projected changes in TC behavior and sea levels. The derived historical 100-year surge (the event with a 1% yearly exceedance probability) agrees well with historical observations and other modeling techniques. When coupled with an inundation model, we find that heightened TC intensities and sea levels by the end of the century result in a 50% increase in population at risk. Key findings include markedly heightened risk in Florida, and critical thresholds identified in Georgia and South Carolina.</description>

      <title>AI-Informed Model Analogs for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting is crucial for public health, disaster preparedness, and agriculture, and yet it remains a particularly challenging timescale to predict. We explore the use of an interpretable AI-informed model analog forecasting approach, previously employed on longer timescales, to improve S2S predictions. Using an artificial neural network, we learn a mask of weights to optimize analog selection and showcase its versatility across three varied prediction tasks: 1) classification of Week 3-4 Southern California summer temperatures; 2) regional regression of Month 1 midwestern U.S. summer temperatures; and 3) classification of Month 1-2 North Atlantic wintertime upper atmospheric winds. The AI-informed analogs outperform traditional analog forecasting approaches, as well as climatology and persistence baselines, for deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on both climate model and reanalysis data. We find the analog ensembles built using the AI-informed approach also produce better predictions of temperature extremes and improve representation of forecast uncertainty. Finally, by using an interpretable-AI framework, we analyze the learned masks of weights to better understand S2S sources of predictability.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Koopman approaches to physics-informed machine learning for long-term sea-surface temperature forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00399v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting sea-surface temperature weeks to months into the future is an important step toward long term weather forecasting. Standard atmosphere-ocean coupled numerical models provide accurate sea-surface forecasts on the scale of a few days to a few weeks, but many important weather systems require greater foresight. In this paper we propose machine-learning approaches sea-surface temperature forecasting that are accurate on the scale of dozens of weeks. Our approach is based in Koopman operator theory, a useful tool for dynamical systems modelling. With this approach, we predict sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico up to 180 days into the future based on a present image of thermal conditions and three years of historical training data. We evaluate the combination of a basic Koopman method with a convolutional autoencoder, and a newly proposed "consistent Koopman" method, in various permutations. We show that the Koopman approach consistently outperforms baselines, and we discuss the utility of our additional assumptions and methods in this sea-surface temperature domain.</description>

      <title>Detection, attribution, and modeling of climate change: key open issues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CMIP global climate models (GCMs) assess that nearly 100% of global surface warming observed between 1850-1900 and 2011-2020 is attributable to anthropogenic drivers like greenhouse gas emissions. These models also generate future climate projections based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), aiding in risk assessment and the development of costly Net-Zero climate mitigation strategies. Yet, the CMIP GCMs face significant scientific challenges in attributing and modeling climate change, particularly in capturing natural climate variability over multiple timescales throughout the Holocene. Other key concerns include the reliability of global surface temperature records, the accuracy of solar irradiance models, and the robustness of climate sensitivity estimates. Global warming estimates may be overstated due to uncorrected non-climatic biases, and the GCMs may significantly underestimate solar and astronomical influences on climate variations. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing could be lower than commonly assumed; empirical findings suggest ECS values lower than 3 K and possibly even closer to 1.1 +/- 0.4 K. Empirical models incorporating natural variability suggest that the 21st-century global warming may remain moderate, even under SSP scenarios that do not necessitate Net-Zero emission policies. These findings raise important questions regarding the necessity and urgency of implementing aggressive climate mitigation strategies. While GCMs remain essential tools for climate research and policymaking, their scientific limitations underscore the need for more refined modeling approaches to ensure accurate future climate assessments. Addressing uncertainties related to climate change detection, natural variability, solar influences, and climate sensitivity to radiative forcing will enhance predictions and better inform sustainable climate strategies.</description>

      <title>A general framework for the asymptotic analysis of moist atmospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with asymptotic analysis for the derivation of partial differential equation models for geophysical flows in the earth's atmosphere with moist process closures, and we study their mathematical properties. Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations for dry air, we put the seminal papers of Klein, Majda et al. in a unified context and then discuss the appropriate extension to moist air. In particular, we deal with the scale-independent distinguished limit for the universal parameters of atmospheric motion for moist air, with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that links saturation vapor pressure and air temperature, and with the mathematical formulation of phase changes associated with cloud formation and rain production. We conclude with a discussion of the precipitating quasigeostrophic (PQG) models introduced by Smith &amp; Stechmann. Our intent is, on the one hand, to convey the problems arising at the modeling stage to mathematicians; on the other hand, we want to present the relevant mathematical methods and results to meteorologists.</description>

      <title>Regional climate risk assessment from climate models using probabilistic machine learning</title>

Abstract: Accurate, actionable climate information at km scales is crucial for robust natural hazard risk assessment and infrastructure planning. Simulating climate at these resolutions remains intractable, forcing reliance on downscaling: either physics-based or statistical methods that transform climate simulations from coarse to impact-relevant resolutions. One major challenge for downscaling is to comprehensively capture the interdependency among climate processes of interest, a prerequisite for representing climate hazards. However, current approaches either lack the desired scalability or are bespoke to specific types of hazards. We introduce GenFocal, a computationally efficient, general-purpose, end-to-end generative framework that gives rise to full probabilistic characterizations of complex climate processes interacting at fine spatiotemporal scales. GenFocal more accurately assesses extreme risk in the current climate than leading approaches, including one used in the US 5th National Climate Assessment. It produces plausible tracks of tropical cyclones, providing accurate statistics of their genesis and evolution, even when they are absent from the corresponding climate simulations. GenFocal also shows compelling results that are consistent with the literature on projecting climate impact on decadal timescales. GenFocal revolutionizes how climate simulations can be efficiently augmented with observations and harnessed to enable future climate impact assessments at the spatiotemporal scales relevant to local and regional communities. We believe this work establishes genAI as an effective paradigm for modeling complex, high-dimensional multivariate statistical correlations that have deterred precise quantification of climate risks associated with hazards such as wildfires, extreme heat, tropical cyclones, and flooding; thereby enabling the evaluation of adaptation strategies.</description>
