      <title>Impact of Subsurface Oxygen on CO2 Charging Energy Changes in Cu Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface oxygen in oxide-derived copper catalysts significantly influences CO$_2$ activation. However, its effect on the molecular charging process, the key to forming the CO$_2^{\delta-}$ intermediate, remains poorly understood. We employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate the impact of the structural factors induced by the subsurface oxygen on charged activation of CO$_2$. By computing the molecular single-particle state energy of the electron-accepting orbital ($\sigma*$) on Cu (111) surface, we examined how this molecular quasi-particle (QP) energy changes with varied vicinity of adsorption and multiple subsurface oxygen configuration. We demonstrate that subsurface oxygen impairs CO$_2$ charging, with its presence and density being influential factors. The non-local potential proves substantial for accurate excitation energy predictions yet is not sensitive to minor atomic structural changes. More importantly, state delocalization and hybridization are critical for determining QP energy. These insights are enlightening for designing atomic architectures to optimize catalytic performance on modified surfaces.</description>

      <title>Toward Phonon-Limited Transport in Two-Dimensional Electronics by Oxygen-Free Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future electronics require aggressive scaling of channel material thickness while maintaining device performance. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates, but despite over two decades of research, experimental performance still lags theoretical expectations. Here, we develop an oxygen-free approach to push the electrical transport of 2D field-effect transistors toward the theoretical phonon-limited intrinsic mobility. We achieve record carrier mobilities of 91 (132) cm2V-1s-1 for mono- (bi-) layer MoS2 transistors on SiO2 substrate. Statistics from over 60 devices confirm that oxygen-free fabrication enhances key figures of merit by more than an order of magnitude. While previous studies suggest that 2D transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2 and WS2 are stable in air, we show that short-term ambient exposure can degrade their device performance through irreversible oxygen chemisorption. This study emphasizes the criticality of avoiding oxygen exposure, offering guidance for device manufacturing for fundamental research and practical applications of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Dependent Polaron Crossover in Tellurene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles arising from electron-phonon coupling, are crucial in understanding material properties such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. However, scarce studies have been performed to investigate the formation of polarons in low-dimensional materials with phonon polarity and electronic structure transitions. In this work, we studied polarons of tellurene that are composed of chiral chains of tellurium atoms. The frequency and linewidth of the A1 phonon, which becomes increasingly polar for thinner tellurene, exhibit an abrupt change when the thickness of tellurene is below 10 nm. Meanwhile, the field effect mobility of tellurene drops rapidly as the thickness is smaller than 10 nm. These phonon and transport signatures, combined with the calculated phonon polarity and band structure, suggest a crossover from large polarons for bulk tellurium to small polarons for few-layer tellurene. Effective field theory considers the phonon renormalization in the strong coupling (small polaron) regime, and semi-quantitatively reproduces the observed phonon hardening and broadening effects in few-layer tellurene. This polaron crossover stems from the quasi-1D nature of tellurene where modulation of the interchain distance reduces the dielectric screening and promotes electron-phonon coupling. Our work provides valuable insights into the influence of polarons on phononic, electronic, and structural properties in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Realizing tunable Fermi level in SnTe by defect control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tuning of the Fermi level in tin telluride, a topological crystalline insulator, is essential for accessing its unique surface states and optimizing its electronic properties for applications such as spintronics and quantum computing. In this study, we demonstrate that the Fermi level in tin telluride can be effectively modulated by controlling the tin concentration during chemical vapor deposition synthesis. By introducing tin-rich conditions, we observed a blue shift in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level peaks of both tin and tellurium, indicating an upward shift in the Fermi level. This shift is corroborated by a decrease in work function values measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming the suppression of Sn vacancies. Our findings provide a low-cost, scalable method to achieve tunable Fermi levels in tin telluride, offering a significant advancement in the development of materials with tailored electronic properties for next-generation technological applications.</description>

      <title>Role of material-dependent properties in THz field-derivative-torque-induced nonlinear magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has often delineated the linear and nonlinear magnetization dynamics, even at ultrashort timescales e.g., femtoseconds. In contrast, several other non-relativistic and relativistic spin torques have been reported as an extension of the LLG spin dynamics. Here, we explore the contribution of the relativistic field-derivative torque (FDT) in the nonlinear THz magnetization dynamics response applied to ferrimagnets with high Gilbert damping and exchange magnon frequency. Our findings suggest that the FDT plays a significant role in magnetization dynamics in both linear and nonlinear regimes, bridging the gap between the traditional LLG spin dynamics and experimental observations. We find that the coherent THz magnon excitation amplitude is enhanced with the field-derivative torque. Furthermore, a phase shift in the magnon oscillation is induced by the FDT term. This phase shift is almost 90 for the antiferromagnet, while it is almost zero for the ferrimagnet under our investigation. Analyzing the dual THz excitation and their FDT, we find that the nonlinear signals can not be distinctly observed without the FDT terms. However, the inclusion of the FDT terms produces distinct nonlinear signals which matches extremely well with the previously reported experimental results.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing different stackings in WSe2 bilayers grown Using Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stacking order of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is attracting tremendous interest as an essential component of van der Waals heterostructures. A common and fast approach to distinguish between the AAprime (2H) and AB (3R) configurations uses the relative edge orientation of each triangular layer (theta) from optical images. Here, we highlight that this method alone is not sufficient to fully identify the stacking order. Instead we propose a model and methodology to accurately determine the bilayer configuration of WSe2 using second harmonic generation (SHG) and Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the SHG response of the AB phase (theta = 0) deg layers is more intense than the signal from the single layer structure. However, the SHG totally vanishes in the AAprime and ABprime phases (theta = 60 deg) and 0 deg respectively) of homo-bilayer WSe2. Also, several optical features of homo-bilayer WSe2 are found to depend on the details of the stacking order, with the difference being the clearest in the low frequency (LF) Raman frequencies, as confirmed by DFT simulation. This allows unambiguous, high-throughput, nondestructive identification of stacking order in TMDs, which is not robustly addressed in this emerging research area.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Investigation of PbSe Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the speed of sound in gaseous cis-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene, (R1234ze(Z)), are presented. The measurements were performed using a quasi-spherical acoustic resonator at temperatures between 307 K and 420 K and pressures up to 1.8 MPa. Ideal-gas heat capacities and acoustic virial coefficients over the same temperature range were directly calculated from the results. The relative accuracy of our determinations of the speed of sound $w$($p$,$T$) of R1234ze(Z) was approximately $\pm$ 0.02%. The accuracy of the determination of the ideal gas heat capacity ratio ${\gamma}^{0}$($T$) was approximately $\pm$ 0.25%. These data were found to be mostly consistent with the predictions of a fundamental equation of state of R1234ze(Z).</description>

      <title>Optimization of Coulomb Energies in Gigantic Configurational Spaces of Multi-Element Ionic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the novel energy materials contain multiple elements occupying a single site in their lattice. The exceedingly large configurational space of these materials imposes challenges in determining their ground-state structures. Coulomb energies of possible configurations generally show a satisfactory correlation to computed energies at higher levels of theory and thus allow to screen for minimum-energy structures. Employing a second-order cluster expansion, we obtain an efficient Coulomb energy optimizer using Monte Carlo and Genetic Algorithms. The presented optimization package, GOAC (Global Optimization of Atomistic Configurations by Coulomb), can achieve a speed up of several orders of magnitude compared to existing software. Our code is able to find low-energy configurations of complex systems involving up to $10^{920}$ structural configurations. The GOAC package thus provides an efficient method for constructing ground-state atomistic models for multi-element materials with gigantic configurational spaces.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectrical potential and derivation of Kelvin relation for thermoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on thermoelectricity is primarily focused on the exploration of materials with enhanced performance, resulting in a lack of fundamental understanding of the thermoelectric effect. Such circumstance is not conducive to the further improvement of the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion. Moreover, available physical images of the derivation of the Kelvin relations are ambiguous. Derivation processes are complex and need a deeper understanding of thermoelectric conversion phenomena. In this paper, a new physical quantity 'thermoelectrical potential' from the physical nature of the thermoelectric conversion is proposed. The quantity is expressed as the product of the Seebeck coefficient and the absolute temperature, i.e., ST. Based on the thermoelectrical potential, we clarify the conversion of the various forms of energy in the thermoelectric effect by presenting a clear physical picture. Results from the analysis of the physical mechanism of the Seebeck effect indicate that the thermoelectrical potential, rather than the temperature gradient field, exerts a force on the charge carriers in the thermoelectric material. Based on thermoelectric potential, the Peltier effects at different material interfaces can be macroscopically described. The Kelvin relation is rederived using the proposed quantity, which simplified the derivation process and elucidated the physical picture of the thermoelectrical conversion.</description>

      <title>Polarization Pinning at an Antiphase Boundary in Multiferroic YbFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The switching characteristics of ferroelectrics and multiferroics are influenced by the interaction of topological defects with domain-walls. We report on the pinning of polarization due to antiphase boundaries in thin films of the multiferroic hexagonal YbFeO$_3$. We have directly resolved the atomic structure of a sharp antiphase boundary (APB) in YbFeO$_3$ thin films using a combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and total energy calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT). We find the presence of a layer of FeO$_6$ octahedra at the APB that bridge the adjacent domains. STEM imaging shows a reversal in the direction of polarization on moving across the APB, which DFT calculations confirm is structural in nature as the polarization reversal reduces the distortion of the FeO$_6$ octahedral layer at the APB. Such APBs in hexagonal perovskites are expected to serve as domain-wall pinning sites and hinder ferroelectric switching of the domains.</description>

      <title>Representing Born effective charges with equivariant graph convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks have been instrumental in machine learning of material properties. When representing tensorial properties, weights and descriptors of a physics-informed network must obey certain transformation rules to ensure the independence of the property on the choice of the reference frame. Here we explicitly encode such properties using an equivariant graph convolutional neural network. The network respects rotational symmetries of the crystal throughout by using equivariant weights and descriptors and provides a tensorial output of the target value. Applications to tensors of atomic Born effective charges in diverse materials including perovskite oxides, Li3PO4, and ZrO2, are demonstrated, and good performance and generalization ability is obtained.</description>

      <title>Unraveling pairon excitations and the antiferromagnetic contributions in the cuprate specific heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal measurements, such as the entropy and the specific heat, reveal key elementary excitations for understanding the cuprates. In this paper, we study the specific heat measurements on three different compounds La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and show that the data are compatible with `pairons' and their excitations. However, the precise fits require the contribution of the antiferromagnetic entropy deduced from the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$.
  Two temperature scales are involved in the excitations above the critical temperature $T_c$: the pseudogap $T^*$, related to pairon excitations, and the magnetic correlation temperature, $T_{max}$, having very different dependencies on the carrier density ($p$). In agreement with our previous analysis of $\chi(T)$, the $T_{max}(p)$ line is not the signature of a gap in the electronic density of states, but is rather the temperature scale of strong local antiferromagnetic correlations which dominate for low carrier concentration. These progressively evolve into paramagnetic fluctuations in the overdoped limit.
  Our results are in striking contradiction with the model of J. L. Tallon and J. G. Storey [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 054507 (2023)], who reaffirm the idea of a $T$-independent gap $E_g$, whose temperature scale $T_g=E_g/k_B$ decreases linearly with $p$ and vanishes at a critical value $p_c \sim 0.19$.
  Finally, we discuss the unconventional fluctuation regime above $T_c$, which is associated with a mini-gap $\delta\sim$ 2\,meV in the pairon excitation spectrum. This energy scale is fundamental to the condensation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Dataset of Tensile Properties for Sub-sized Specimens of Nuclear Structural Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical testing with sub-sized specimens plays an important role in the nuclear industry, facilitating tests in confined experimental spaces with lower irradiation levels and accelerating the qualification of new materials. The reduced size of specimens results in different material behavior at the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale, in comparison to standard-sized specimens, which is referred to as the specimen size effect. Although analytical models have been proposed to correlate the properties of sub-sized specimens to standard-sized specimens, these models lack broad applicability across different materials and testing conditions. The objective of this study is to create the first large public dataset of tensile properties for sub-sized specimens used in nuclear structural materials. We performed an extensive literature review of relevant publications and extracted over 1,000 tensile testing records comprising 54 parameters including material type and composition, manufacturing information, irradiation conditions, specimen dimensions, and tensile properties. The dataset can serve as a valuable resource to investigate the specimen size effect and develop computational methods to correlate the tensile properties of sub-sized specimens.</description>

      <title>Magnetic diffuse scattering of the $S$ = 5/2 fcc antiferromagnets Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic diffuse scattering of isostructural $S$ = 5/2 fcc antiferromagnets Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$ using polarized neutrons. Both materials display short-range correlated magnetism above their respective magnetic ordering temperatures of 20 K and 8 K. The spin correlations were analysed using a Reverse Monte Carlo approach. For Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$, we find antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor correlations along with ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor correlations directly linked to the Type I order below $T_N$. For Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$, both the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spin correlations are antiferromagnetic in the paramagnetic state. The short-range spin correlations persist up to $T$ = 7$T_N$. The magnetic diffuse scattering was also fitted using Onsager reaction-field theory allowing us to evaluate the magnetic interactions in these materials. We obtained $J_1$ = -3.25(3) K and $J_2$ = 0.41(2) K for Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and $J_1$ = -1.08(1) K and $J_2$ = -0.88(1) K for Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$. These interactions are comparable to previous results from inelastic neutron scattering experiments below $T_N$, which highlights the potential of the Onsager approach for the analysis of magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Branches, Tie Chains and Entanglements in Bimodal Polyethylene Single Crystals under Uniaxial Tensile Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and a united-monomer model of PE, single well-aligned multi-lamella PE crystals grown in previous work [ACS Macro Letters 12, 808 (2023)] are deformed uniaxially to mimic tensile testing. During deformation, the crystallinity, tie-chain segments, entanglements and folds are monitored and correlated with the stress-strain behaviour and mechanical properties. At small strains, the single well-aligned PE crystals reveal a larger Young modulus when the deformation direction is perpendicular to the global stem direction. At large strains, the memory of the initial topology plays little role in the mechanical response and is observed to be completely destroyed. Short chain branching appears to suppress disentanglement and shear induced alignment of the chains during deformation. As a result, tie-chains and entanglements persist in branched systems and the peak stress at failure is found to be proportional to the change in number of tie-chains from the beginning of the brittle break to its end. Our findings suggest the remarkable mechanical properties of bimodal branched PE result directly from tie-chains, with entanglements playing a secondary role in the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Color Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an essential material for the encapsulation layer in van der Waals heterostructures and efficient deep ultra-violet optoelectronics. This is primarily due to its remarkable physical properties and ultrawide bandgap (close to 6 eV, and even larger in some cases) properties. Color centers in hBN refer to intrinsic vacancies and extrinsic impurities within the 2D crystal lattice, which result in distinct optical properties in the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) range. Furthermore, each color center in hBN exhibits a unique emission spectrum and possesses various spin properties. These characteristics open up possibilities for the development of next-generation optoelectronics and quantum information applications, including room-temperature single-photon sources and quantum sensors. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the atomic configuration, optical and quantum properties, and different techniques employed for the formation of color centers in hBN. A deep understanding of color centers in hBN allows for advances in the development of next-generation UV optoelectronic applications, solid-state quantum technologies, and nanophotonics by harnessing the exceptional capabilities offered by hBN color centers.</description>

      <title>Structural and dynamical investigation of glassforming smectogen by X-ray diffraction and infra-red spectroscopy aided by density functional theory calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular arrangement in the chiral smectic phases of the glassforming (S)-4'-(1-methylheptylcarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl 4-[7-(2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluorobutoxy) heptyl-1-oxy]benzoate is investigated by X-ray diffraction. An increased correlation length of the positional short-range order in the supercooled state agrees with the previous assumption of the hexatic smectic phase. However, the registered X-ray diffraction patterns are not typical for the hexatic phases. Comparison of the smectic layer spacing and optical tilt angle indicates a strongly non-linear shape of molecules, which enables choice of the molecular models obtained by DFT calculations, used subsequently to interpret the infra-red spectra. The presumption of the hexatic smectic FA* or IA* phase is supported by the splitting of the absorption bands related to the C=O stretching in the supercooled state, which is absent in the smectic CA* phase above the melting temperature. The glass transition affects the temperature dependence of the smectic layer spacing but only subtly impacts the infra-red spectra. Application of the k-means cluster analysis enables distinction between the infra-red spectra below and above the glass transition temperature, but only for certain spectral ranges.</description>

      <title>Real-time observation of frustrated ultrafast recovery from ionisation in nanostructured SiO2 using laser driven accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionising radiation interactions in matter can trigger a cascade of processes that underpin long-lived damage in the medium. To date, however, a lack of suitable methodologies has precluded our ability to understand the role that material nanostructure plays in this cascade. Here, we use transient photoabsorption to track the lifetime of free electrons (t_c) in bulk and nanostructured SiO2 (aerogel) irradiated by picosecond-scale (10^-12 s) bursts of X-rays and protons from a laser-driven accelerator. Optical streaking reveals a sharp increase in t_c from &lt; 1 ps to &gt; 50 ps over a narrow average density (p_av) range spanning the expected phonon-fracton crossover in aerogels. Numerical modelling suggests that this discontinuity can be understood by a quenching of rapid, phonon-assisted recovery in irradiated nanostructured SiO_2. This is shown to lead to an extended period of enhanced energy density in the excited electron population. Overall, these results open a direct route to tracking how low-level processes in complex systems can underpin macroscopically observed phenomena and, importantly, the conditions that permit them to emerge.</description>

Abstract: Nearly thirty years after its inception, the field of DNA-programmed colloidal self-assembly has begun to realize its initial promise. In this review, we summarize recent developments in designing effective interactions and understanding the dynamic self-assembly pathways of DNA-coated nanoparticles and microparticles, as well as how these advances have propelled tremendous progress in crystal engineering. We also highlight exciting new directions showing that new classes of subunits combining nanoparticles with DNA origami can be used to engineer novel multicomponent assemblies, including structures with self-limiting, finite sizes. We conclude by providing an outlook on how recent theoretical advances focusing on the kinetics of self-assembly could usher in new materials-design opportunities, like the possibility of retrieving multiple distinct target structures from a single suspension or accessing new classes of materials that are stabilized by energy dissipation, mimicking self-assembly in living systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Nonequilibrium Dirac Systems Induced by Anomalous Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Scaling Reveals Topological Defects and Anomalous Evolution of a Photoinduced Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium states of quantum materials can exhibit exotic properties and enable unprecedented functionality and applications. These transient states are inherently inhomogeneous, characterized by the formation of topologically protected structures, requiring nanometer spatial resolution on femtosecond timescales to resolve their evolution. Using ultrafast total x-ray scattering at a free electron laser and a sophisticated scaling analysis, we gain unique access to the dynamics on the relevant mesoscopic lengthscales. Our results provide direct evidence that ultrafast excitation of LaTe$_3$ leads to formation of topological vortex strings of the charge density wave. These dislocations of the charge density wave exhibit anomalous, subdiffusive dynamics, slowing the equilibration process, providing rare insight into the nonequilibrium mesoscopic response in a quantum material. Our findings establish a general framework to investigate properties of topological defects, which are expected to be ubiquitous in nonequilibrium phase transitions and may arrest equilibration and enhance competing orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline alloys and related mixed systems make up a large family of materials with high tunability which have been proposed as the solution to a large number of energy related materials design problems. Due to the presence of chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts nor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently large configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary. To this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the past decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to predict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a small subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a cluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with care. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process, highlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial consists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a relatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging systems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of cluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Scientific text is a promising source of data in materials science, with ongoing research into utilising textual data for materials discovery. In this study, we developed and tested a novel approach to extract material-property relationships from scientific publications using the Question Answering (QA) method. QA performance was evaluated for information extraction of perovskite bandgaps based on a human query. We observed considerable variation in results with five different large language models fine-tuned for the QA task. Best extraction accuracy was achieved with the QA MatBERT and F1-scores improved on the current state-of-the-art. This work demonstrates the QA workflow and paves the way towards further applications. The simplicity, versatility and accuracy of the QA approach all point to its considerable potential for text-driven discoveries in materials research.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. The basal (0001) plane of ${\alpha}$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was imaged with noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically-defined tip apex. The surface forms a complex $({\sqrt31} {\times} {\sqrt31})R{\pm}9{\deg}$ reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual O and Al surface atoms come directly from experiment; how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk was determined based on computational modeling. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Segregation at prior austenite grain boundaries: the competition between boron and hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between boron and hydrogen at grain boundaries has been investigated experimentally and numerically in boron-doped and boron-free martensitic steels using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) and ab initio calculations. The calculations show that boron and hydrogen are attracted to grain boundaries but boron can repel hydrogen. This behavior has also been observed using TDS measurements, with the disappearance of one peak when boron is incorporated into the microstructure. Additionally, the microstructure of both steels has been studied through electron backscattered diffraction, electron channeling contrast imaging, synchrotron X-ray measurements, and atom probe tomography. While they have a similar grain size, grain boundary distribution, and dislocation densities, a pronounced boron segregation into PAGBs is observed for boron-doped steels. Then, the equilibrium hydrogen concentration in different trapping sites has been evaluated using the Langmuir-McLean approximation. This thermodynamic model shows that the distribution of hydrogen is identical for all traps when the total hydrogen concentration is low for boron-free steel. However, when it increases, traps of the lowest segregation energies (mostly PAGBs) are firstly saturated, which promotes failure initiation at this defect type. This finding partially explains why PAGBs are the weakest microstructure feature when martensitic steels are exposed to hydrogen-containing environments.</description>

      <title>Unified Model for Probing Solar Cell Dynamics via Cyclic Voltammetry and Impedance Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in emerging solar cell technologies such as hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, there are still significant limitations related to the stability of the devices and their non-ideal electrical behavior under certain external stimuli. We present a conceptual framework for characterizing photovoltaic devices by integrating cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (IS). This framework is constructed from a microscopic, multi-mode perspective that explicitly accounts for drift, diffusion, displacement, and memory contributions. We derive comprehensive analytical expressions for current-voltage relationships and complex admittance. Our model reveals the inseparable connection between hysteresis behaviors in current-voltage characteristics observed in CV and the apparent capacitive and inductive behaviors seen in IS spectral analysis. We demonstrate how CV and IS naturally complement each other, providing a deeper microscopic understanding of device performance and limitations. Additionally, we establish the relationship between intrinsic material parameters and experimentally accessible extrinsic parameters such as light intensity, temperature, DC bias, voltage amplitude, and frequency. This framework enables unprecedented optimization of solar cell performance, marking a significant advancement towards sustainability.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and predicting interface diffusion phenomena in materials is crucial for various industrial applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, battery technology, and catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients and their Uncertainties from Computer Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18244</link>

Abstract: Self-diffusion coefficients, $\D$, are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations by fitting a linear model to the observed mean-squared displacements (MSDs) of mobile species. MSDs derived from simulation exhibit statistical noise that causes uncertainty in the resulting estimate of $\D$. An optimal scheme for estimating $\D$ minimises this uncertainty, i.e., it will have high statistical efficiency, and also gives an accurate estimate of the uncertainty itself. We present a scheme for estimating $\D$ from a single simulation trajectory with high statistical efficiency and accurately estimating the uncertainty in the predicted value. The statistical distribution of MSDs observable from a given simulation is modelled as a multivariate normal distribution using an analytical covariance matrix for an equivalent system of freely diffusing particles, which we parameterise from the available simulation data. We use Bayesian regression to sample the distribution of linear models that are compatible with this multivariate normal distribution, to obtain a statistically efficient estimate of $D^*$ and an accurate estimate of the associated statistical uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric Supercomputing for Materials Science: A Perspective on Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09733</link>

Abstract: Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.</description>

      <title>How quickly can sodium-ion learn? Assessing scenarios for techno-economic competitiveness against lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we identify many sodium-ion pathways that might reach cost-competitiveness with low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains -- namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dipole Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$: magnetoelectricity and contact-free signatures of topological transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe$_2$ moir\'e superlattice, including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization $M_{\parallel}$ along the field, through which an AC field can drive magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact free detection of the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase novel functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology and electrical polarization.</description>

      <title>Prerelaxation in quantum, classical, and quantum-classical two-impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>
