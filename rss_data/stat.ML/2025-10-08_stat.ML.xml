      <title>A General Constructive Upper Bound on Shallow Neural Nets Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an upper bound on the number of neurons required in a shallow
  neural network to approximate a continuous function on a compact set with a
  given accuracy. This method, inspired by a specific proof of the
  Stone-Weierstrass theorem, is constructive and more general than previous
  bounds of this character, as it applies to any continuous function on any
  compact set.</description>

      <title>Online Matching via Reinforcement Learning: An Expert Policy Orchestration Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online matching problems arise in many complex systems, from cloud services and online marketplaces to organ exchange networks, where timely, principled decisions are critical for maintaining high system performance. Traditional heuristics in these settings are simple and interpretable but typically tailored to specific operating regimes, which can lead to inefficiencies when conditions change. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns to orchestrate a set of such expert policies, leveraging their complementary strengths in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Building on the Adv2 framework (Jonckheere et al., 2024), our method combines expert decisions through advantage-based weight updates and extends naturally to settings where only estimated value functions are available. We establish both expectation and high-probability regret guarantees and derive a novel finite-time bias bound for temporal-difference learning, enabling reliable advantage estimation even under constant step size and non-stationary dynamics. To support scalability, we introduce a neural actor-critic architecture that generalizes across large state spaces while preserving interpretability. Simulations on stochastic matching models, including an organ exchange scenario, show that the orchestrated policy converges faster and yields higher system level efficiency than both individual experts and conventional RL baselines. Our results highlight how structured, adaptive learning can improve the modeling and management of complex resource allocation and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning with Fine-Grained Gap-Dependent Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds for model-free reinforcement learning in episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes. Existing model-free algorithms achieve minimax worst-case regret, but their gap-dependent bounds remain coarse and fail to fully capture the structure of suboptimality gaps. We address this limitation by establishing fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds for both UCB-based and non-UCB-based algorithms. In the UCB-based setting, we develop a novel analytical framework that explicitly separates the analysis of optimal and suboptimal state-action pairs, yielding the first fine-grained regret upper bound for UCB-Hoeffding (Jin et al., 2018). To highlight the generality of this framework, we introduce ULCB-Hoeffding, a new UCB-based algorithm inspired by AMB (Xu et al.,2021) but with a simplified structure, which enjoys fine-grained regret guarantees and empirically outperforms AMB. In the non-UCB-based setting, we revisit the only known algorithm AMB, and identify two key issues in its algorithm design and analysis: improper truncation in the $Q$-updates and violation of the martingale difference condition in its concentration argument. We propose a refined version of AMB that addresses these issues, establishing the first rigorous fine-grained gap-dependent regret for a non-UCB-based method, with experiments demonstrating improved performance over AMB.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Equivalence for Self-Attention: Asymptotic Spectral Analysis of Attention Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-attention layers have become fundamental building blocks of modern deep neural networks, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly from the perspective of random matrix theory. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention matrix and establish the first Gaussian equivalence result for attention. In a natural regime where the inverse temperature remains of constant order, we show that the singular value distribution of the attention matrix is asymptotically characterized by a tractable linear model. We further demonstrate that the distribution of squared singular values deviates from the Marchenko-Pastur law, which has been believed in previous work. Our proof relies on two key ingredients: precise control of fluctuations in the normalization term and a refined linearization that leverages favorable Taylor expansions of the exponential. This analysis also identifies a threshold for linearization and elucidates why attention, despite not being an entrywise operation, admits a rigorous Gaussian equivalence in this regime.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Dynamical Clustering of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis using publicly available databases.</description>

      <title>PyCFRL: A Python library for counterfactually fair offline reinforcement learning via sequential data preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn and evaluate a sequential decision rule, often referred to as a "policy", that maximizes the population-level benefit in an environment across possibly infinitely many time steps. However, the sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize overall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its major use cases through a data example. The library is publicly available on PyPI and Github (https://github.com/JianhanZhang/PyCFRL), and detailed tutorials can be found in the PyCFRL documentation (https://pycfrl-documentation.netlify.app).</description>

      <title>Root Cause Analysis of Outliers in Unknown Cyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of outliers in cyclic causal graphs with linear structural equations, tracing them back to one or several "root cause" nodes. We show that it is possible to identify a short list of potential root causes provided that the perturbation is sufficiently strong and propagates according to the same structural equations as in the normal mode. This shortlist consists of the true root causes together with those of its parents lying on a cycle with the root cause. Notably, our method does not require prior knowledge of the causal graph.</description>

      <title>Explaining Models under Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution via Hoeffding Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the behavior of predictive models with random inputs can be achieved through sub-models decomposition, where such sub-models have easier interpretable features. Arising from the uncertainty quantification community, recent results have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of a generalized Hoeffding decomposition for such predictive models when the stochastic input variables are correlated, based on concepts of oblique projection onto L 2 subspaces. This article focuses on the case where the input variables have Bernoulli distributions and provides a complete description of this decomposition. We show that in this case the underlying L 2 subspaces are one-dimensional and that the functional decomposition is explicit. This leads to a complete interpretability framework and theoretically allows reverse engineering. Explicit indicators of the influence of inputs on the output prediction (exemplified by Sobol' indices and Shapley effects) can be explicitly derived. Illustrated by numerical experiments, this type of analysis proves useful for addressing decision-support problems, based on binary decision diagrams, Boolean networks or binary neural networks. The article outlines perspectives for exploring high-dimensional settings and, beyond the case of binary inputs, extending these findings to models with finite countable inputs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Robust Portfolio Optimization under Stress Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-changing and intricate landscape of financial markets, portfolio optimisation remains a formidable challenge for investors and asset managers. Conventional methods often struggle to capture the complex dynamics of market behaviour and align with diverse investor preferences. To address this, we propose an innovative framework, termed Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning (DARL), which synergistically integrates Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for portfolio management. By leveraging DDPMs to generate synthetic market crash scenarios conditioned on varying stress intensities, our approach significantly enhances the robustness of training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DARL outperforms traditional baselines, delivering superior risk-adjusted returns and resilience against unforeseen crises, such as the 2025 Tariff Crisis. This work offers a robust and practical methodology to bolster stress resilience in DRL-driven financial applications.</description>

      <title>Split Conformal Classification with Unsupervised Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples to transform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with a target coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strong performance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require to use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used for training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the use of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional labels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for split conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification tasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using unsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples previously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental results show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to that with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in performance guarantees and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Repression and Mobilization in Bangladesh's July Revolution Using Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2024 July Revolution in Bangladesh represents a landmark event in the study of civil resistance. This study investigates the central paradox of the success of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to quell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a mixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the conflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a disaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative analysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and mobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like the July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial role of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects, we specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence for a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect. Our Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an immediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We further demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break analysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in the conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of the first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th. A complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65) corroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying "excessive force against protesters" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide escalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent, non-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and accelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality.</description>

      <title>Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse &amp; noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.</description>

      <title>Making and Evaluating Calibrated Forecasts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness: it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors, regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in prior work.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters, akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels information.</description>

      <title>Nearly Instance-Optimal Parameter Recovery from Many Trajectories via Hellinger Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization under Uncertainty for Training a Scale Parameter in Stochastic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points, resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in computational engineering.</description>

      <title>A Median Perspective on Unlabeled Data for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data, showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However, effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency, as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Wide Neural Networks as a Baseline for the Computational No-Coincidence Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture -- a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.</description>

      <title>Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Attention Head Count on Transformer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for $\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$, for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the practical relevance of our results.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Efficiency in Conformalized Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level $\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$ capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$, the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of $\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>jmstate, a Flexible Python Package for Multi-State Joint Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical joint modeling approaches often rely on competing risks or recurrent event formulations to account for complex real-world processes involving evolving longitudinal markers and discrete event occurrences. However, these frameworks typically capture only limited aspects of the underlying event dynamics.
  Multi-state joint models offer a more flexible alternative by representing full event histories through a network of possible transitions, including recurrent cycles and terminal absorptions, all potentially influenced by longitudinal covariates.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework that unifies longitudinal biomarker modeling with multi-state event processes defined on arbitrary directed graphs. Our approach accommodates both Markovian and semi-Markovian transition structures, and extends classical joint models by coupling nonlinear mixed-effects longitudinal submodels with multi-state survival processes via shared latent structures.
  We derive the full likelihood and develop scalable inference procedures based on stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic prediction framework, enabling individualized risk assessments along complex state-transition trajectories.
  To facilitate reproducibility and dissemination, we provide an open-source Python library \texttt{jmstate} implementing the proposed methodology, available on \href{https://pypi.org/project/jmstate/}{PyPI}. Simulation experiments and a biomedical case study demonstrate the flexibility and performance of the framework in representing complex longitudinal and multi-state event dynamics. The full Python notebooks used to reproduce the experiments as well as the source code of this paper are available on \href{https://gitlab.com/felixlaplante0/jmstate-paper/}{GitLab}.</description>

      <title>DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Nonparametric Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.</description>

      <title>Efficient reductions from a Gaussian source with applications to statistical-computational tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a single observation from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\theta$, we design computationally efficient procedures that can approximately generate an observation from a different target distribution $Q_{\theta}$ uniformly for all $\theta$ in a parameter set. We leverage our technique to establish reduction-based computational lower bounds for several canonical high-dimensional statistical models under widely-believed conjectures in average-case complexity. In particular, we cover cases in which:
  1. $Q_{\theta}$ is a general location model with non-Gaussian distribution, including both light-tailed examples (e.g., generalized normal distributions) and heavy-tailed ones (e.g., Student's $t$-distributions). As a consequence, we show that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussian noise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noise distributions within our class.
  2. $Q_{\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\theta)$ for a general, smooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Using this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures of linear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, and establish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalized linear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the first reduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gap in $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al. (2016). As a second application, we construct a reduction from the sparse rank-1 submatrix model to the planted submatrix model, establishing a pointwise correspondence between the phase diagrams of the two models that faithfully preserves regions of computational hardness and tractability.</description>

      <title>GyroSwin: 5D Surrogates for Gyrokinetic Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</description>

Abstract: The neural tangent kernel is a kernel function defined over the parameter distribution of an infinite width neural network. Despite the impracticality of this limit, the neural tangent kernel has allowed for a more direct study of neural networks and a gaze through the veil of their black box. More recently, it has been shown theoretically that the Laplace kernel and neural tangent kernel share the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space in the space of $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ alluding to their equivalence. In this work, we analyze the practical equivalence of the two kernels. We first do so by matching the kernels exactly and then by matching posteriors of a Gaussian process. Moreover, we analyze the kernels in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and experiment with them in the task of regression.</description>

      <title>Bit-Level Discrete Diffusion with Markov Probabilistic Models: An Improved Framework with Sharp Convergence Bounds under Minimal Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Discrete Markov Probabilistic Models (DMPMs), a novel discrete diffusion algorithm for discrete data generation. The algorithm operates in discrete bit space, where the noising process is a continuous-time Markov chain that flips labels uniformly at random. The time-reversal process, like the forward noise process, is a jump process with its intensity governed by a discrete analogue of the classical score function. Crucially, this intensity is proven to be the conditional expectation of a function of the forward process, underlining theoretical alignment with score-based generative models. We establish convergence bounds for the algorithm under minimal assumptions, ensuring robustness and efficiency, which we demonstrate through experiments on low-dimensional Bernoulli-distributed datasets and high-dimensional binary MNIST data. The results highlight competitive performance in generating discrete structures compared to the state-of-the-art. This work bridges theoretical foundations and practical applications, advancing the development of effective and theoretically grounded discrete generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Is Supervised Learning Really That Different from Unsupervised?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised learning can be decomposed into a two-stage procedure, where (1) all model parameters are selected in an unsupervised manner, and (2) the outputs y are added to the model, without changing the parameter values. This is achieved by a new model selection criterion that, in contrast to cross-validation, can be used also without access to y. For linear ridge regression, we bound the asymptotic out-of-sample risk of our method in terms of the optimal asymptotic risk. We also demonstrate on real and synthetic data that versions of linear and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks, which are trained without access to y, perform similarly to their standard y-based counterparts. Hence, our results suggest that the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is less fundamental than it may appear.</description>

      <title>A Copula Based Supervised Filter for Feature Selection in Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective feature selection is vital for robust and interpretable medical prediction, especially for identifying risk factors concentrated in extreme patient strata. Standard methods emphasize average associations and may miss predictors whose importance lies in the tails of the distribution. We propose a computationally efficient supervised filter that ranks features using the Gumbel copula upper tail dependence coefficient ($\lambda_U$), prioritizing variables that are simultaneously extreme with the positive class. We benchmarked against Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and $L_1$ Elastic Net across four classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Evaluation included paired statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks with label flips, feature noise, and missingness. On CDC, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by about 52% while retaining strong discrimination. Although using all 21 features yielded the highest AUC, our filter significantly outperformed Mutual Information and mRMR and was statistically indistinguishable from ReliefF. On PIMA, with only eight predictors, our ranking produced the numerically highest ROC AUC, and no significant differences were found versus strong baselines. Across both datasets, the upper tail criterion consistently identified clinically coherent, impactful predictors. We conclude that copula based feature selection via upper tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable approach for building risk models in public health and clinical medicine.</description>

      <title>Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_* \geq 1$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of \( \kappa_* \) to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( R d \sqrt{{KT}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $R$ is the norm of the vector of rewards and $K$ is the number of outcomes. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( RdK \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(Rd\sqrt{KT/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our algorithm is minimax-optimal and that our definition of $\kappa_*$ is optimal.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Robust Simulation-Based Inference under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference via telescoping ratio estimation for trawl processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing availability of large and complex datasets has increased interest in temporal stochastic processes that can capture stylized facts such as marginal skewness, non-Gaussian tails, long memory, and even non-Markovian dynamics. While such models are often easy to simulate from, parameter estimation remains challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a promising way forward, but existing methods typically require large training datasets or complex architectures and frequently yield confidence (credible) regions that fail to attain their nominal values, raising doubts on the reliability of estimates for the very features that motivate the use of these models. To address these challenges, we propose a fast and accurate, sample-efficient SBI framework for amortized posterior inference applicable to intractable stochastic processes. The proposed approach relies on two main steps: first, we learn the posterior density by decomposing it sequentially across parameter dimensions. Then, we use Chebyshev polynomial approximations to efficiently generate independent posterior samples, enabling accurate inference even when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods mix poorly. We further develop novel diagnostic tools for SBI in this context, as well as post-hoc calibration techniques; the latter not only lead to performance improvements of the learned inferential tool, but also to the ability to reuse it directly with new time series of varying lengths, thus amortizing the training cost. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on trawl processes, a class of flexible infinitely divisible models that generalize univariate Gaussian processes, applied to energy demand data.</description>

      <title>DPGIIL: Dirichlet Process-Deep Generative Model-Integrated Incremental Learning for Clustering in Transmissibility-based Online Structural Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering based on vibration responses, such as transmissibility functions (TFs), is promising in structural anomaly detection. However, most existing methods struggle to determine the optimal cluster number, handle high-dimensional streaming data, and rely heavily on manually engineered features due to their shallow structures. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel clustering framework, referred to as Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning (DPGIIL), for online structural anomaly detection, which combines the advantages of deep generative models (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference, a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the evidence lower bound, is derived analytically, which enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby allowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process. Additionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational inference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary statistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain information about previous data for incremental learning. For online structural anomaly detection, DPGIIL can not only detect anomalies by dynamically assigning incoming data to new clusters but also indicate different structural states using distinct clusters, thereby providing additional information about the operating conditions of the monitored structure compared to traditional anomaly detectors. Three case studies demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method and show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in both structural anomaly detection and clustering.</description>

      <title>Denoising Score Matching with Random Features: Insights on Diffusion Models from Precise Learning Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the phenomena of generalization and memorization in diffusion models. Empirical studies suggest that these phenomena are influenced by model complexity and the size of the training dataset. In our experiments, we further observe that the number of noise samples per data sample ($m$) used during Denoising Score Matching (DSM) plays a significant and non-trivial role. We capture these behaviors and shed insights into their mechanisms by deriving asymptotically precise expressions for test and train errors of DSM under a simple theoretical setting. The score function is parameterized by random features neural networks, with the target distribution being $d$-dimensional Gaussian. We operate in a regime where the dimension $d$, number of data samples $n$, and number of features $p$ tend to infinity while keeping the ratios $\psi_n=\frac{n}{d}$ and $\psi_p=\frac{p}{d}$ fixed. By characterizing the test and train errors, we identify regimes of generalization and memorization as a function of $\psi_n,\psi_p$, and $m$. Our theoretical findings are consistent with the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Alignment Framework for Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance compared to CTC and the more recently proposed Consistency-Regularized CTC, though with a trade-off in ASR performance. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.</description>

      <title>Learning where to learn: Training data distribution optimization for scientific machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scientific machine learning, models are routinely deployed with parameter values or boundary conditions far from those used in training. This paper studies the learning-where-to-learn problem of designing a training data distribution that minimizes average prediction error across a family of deployment regimes. A theoretical analysis shows how the training distribution shapes deployment accuracy. This motivates two adaptive algorithms based on bilevel or alternating optimization in the space of probability measures. Discretized implementations using parametric distribution classes or nonparametric particle-based gradient flows deliver optimized training distributions that outperform nonadaptive designs. Once trained, the resulting models exhibit improved sample complexity and robustness to distribution shift. This framework unlocks the potential of principled data acquisition for learning functions and solution operators of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Surrogate Risk Bounds for Binary Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work has characterized the conditions under which any sequence minimizing the adversarial surrogate risk also minimizes the adversarial classification risk in the binary setting, a property known as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at which the adversarial classification risk approaches its optimal value along such a sequence. This paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Distributional Machine Unlearning via Selective Data Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly face requirements to remove entire domains of information -- such as toxic language or biases -- rather than individual user data. This task presents a dilemma: full removal of the unwanted domain data is computationally expensive, while random partial removal is statistically inefficient. We find that a domain's statistical influence is often concentrated in a small subset of its data samples, suggesting a path between ineffective partial removal and unnecessary complete removal. We formalize this as distributional unlearning: a framework to select a small subset that balances forgetting an unwanted distribution while preserving a desired one. Using Kullback-Leibler divergence constraints, we derive the exact removal-preservation Pareto frontier for exponential families and prove that models trained on the edited data achieve corresponding log-loss bounds. We propose a distance-based selection algorithm and show it is quadratically more sample-efficient than random removal in the challenging low-divergence regime. Experiments across synthetic, text, and image datasets (Jigsaw, CIFAR-10, SMS spam) show our method requires 15-82% less deletion than full removal for strong unlearning effects, e.g., halving initial forget set accuracy. Ultimately, by showing a small forget set often suffices, our framework lays the foundations for more scalable and rigorous subpopulation unlearning.</description>

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid in limited data regimes, such as in computational social science and human subjects research. While prior technical work has mainly explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (e.g., synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it remains unclear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address this challenge. Intriguingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data (i.e., when they are predictive of each other) can greatly improve estimates of the target parameter. We validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.</description>

      <title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs in the Hilbert space: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.</description>

      <title>On residual network depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep residual architectures, such as ResNet and the Transformer, have enabled models of unprecedented depth, yet a formal understanding of why depth is so effective remains an open question. A popular intuition, following Veit et al. (2016), is that these residual networks behave like ensembles of many shallower models. Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this ensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically equivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our expansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial growth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal, explaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep models. This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical dependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of successful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup. However, while these previous approaches infer scaling factors through optimizer analysis or a heuristic analogy to Batch Normalization, our work offers the first explanation derived directly from the network's inherent functional structure. Specifically, our Residual Expansion Theorem reveals that scaling each residual module provides a principled solution to taming the combinatorial explosion inherent to these architectures. We further show that this scaling acts as a capacity controls that also implicitly regularizes the model's complexity.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Slow-Fast Policy Optimization: Reposition-Before-Update for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and an up to 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.</description>
