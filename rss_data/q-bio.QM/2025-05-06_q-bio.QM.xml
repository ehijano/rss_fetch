      <title>Enhancing TCR-Peptide Interaction Prediction with Pretrained Language Models and Molecular Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR, LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.</description>

      <title>Minimax entropy: The statistical physics of optimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When constructing models of the world, we aim for optimal compressions: models that include as few details as possible while remaining as accurate as possible. But which details -- or features measured in data -- should we choose to include in a model? Here, using the minimum description length principle, we show that the optimal features are the ones that produce the maximum entropy model with minimum entropy, thus yielding a minimax entropy principle. We review applications, which range from machine learning to optimal models of biological networks. Naive implementations, however, are limited to systems with small numbers of states and features. We therefore require new theoretical insights and computational techniques to construct optimal compressions of high-dimensional datasets arising in large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Topology across Scales on Heterogeneous Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexed imaging allows multiple cell types to be simultaneously visualised in a single tissue sample, generating unprecedented amounts of spatially-resolved, biological data. In topological data analysis, persistent homology provides multiscale descriptors of ``shape" suitable for the analysis of such spatial data. Here we propose a novel visualisation of persistence homology (PH) and fine-tune vectorisations thereof (exploring the effect of different weightings for persistence images, a prominent vectorisation of PH). These approaches offer new biological interpretations and promising avenues for improving the analysis of complex spatial biological data especially in multiple cell type data. To illustrate our methods, we apply them to a lung data set from fatal cases of COVID-19 and a data set from lupus murine spleen.</description>

      <title>A Sloppy approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing its full potential depends on effectively managing the complexity of the underlying mathematical models and biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow grounded in the principles of sloppy modeling, offering a practical and principled strategy for building and deploying models in a QSP pipeline. Our approach begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be as comprehensive and unbiased as possible by drawing from the collective knowledge of prior research. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), which simplifies models while preserving their predictive capacity and mechanistic interpretability. Applying MBAM as a context-specific model reduction strategy, we link the simplified representation directly to the downstream predictions of interest. The resulting reduced models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow through case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection. Our analysis suggests several promising next steps for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies in HIV infected patients within the context of a general-purpose QSP modeling workflow.</description>

      <title>PoseX: AI Defeats Physics Approaches on Protein-Ligand Cross Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in protein-ligand docking, especially in modern deep learning methods, and some benchmarks were proposed, e.g., PoseBench, Plinder. However, these benchmarks suffer from less practical evaluation setups (e.g., blind docking, self docking), or heavy framework that involves training, raising challenges to assess docking methods efficiently. To fill this gap, we proposed PoseX, an open-source benchmark focusing on self-docking and cross-docking, to evaluate the algorithmic advances practically and comprehensively. Specifically, first, we curate a new evaluation dataset with 718 entries for self docking and 1,312 for cross docking; second, we incorporate 22 docking methods across three methodological categories, including (1) traditional physics-based methods (e.g., Schr\"odinger Glide), (2) AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock), (3) AI co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we design a relaxation method as post-processing to minimize conformation energy and refine binding pose; fourth, we released a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real time. We draw some key insights via extensive experiments: (1) AI-based approaches have already surpassed traditional physics-based approaches in overall docking accuracy (RMSD). The longstanding generalization issues that have plagued AI molecular docking have been significantly alleviated in the latest models. (2) The stereochemical deficiencies of AI-based approaches can be greatly alleviated with post-processing relaxation. Combining AI docking methods with the enhanced relaxation method achieves the best performance to date. (3) AI co-folding methods commonly face ligand chirality issues, which cannot be resolved by relaxation. The code, curated dataset and leaderboard are released at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of human population reproduction through marriage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear one-sex dynamical model of human population reproduction through marriage. In our model, we assume that a woman can repeatedly marry and divorce but only married women produce children. The iterative marriage process is formulated by a three-state compartmental model, which is described by the system of McKendrick equations with the duration-specific birth rate by age at marriage. In order to see the effect of changes in nuptiality on fertility, new formulae for the reproduction indices are given. In particular, the total fertility rate (TFR) is considered as the product of the indices of marriage and marital fertility. Using the vital statistics of Japan, we can show that our model can provide a reasonable estimate of the Japanese TFR, and its possible future scenario.</description>

      <title>RISE: Radius of Influence based Subgraph Extraction for 3D Molecular Graph Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Population PK Covariates from VAE-Generated Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear. Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space, achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1 regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision pharmacotherapy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing End Stage Renal Disease Outcome Prediction: A Multi-Sourced Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.</description>

      <title>Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>

      <title>MF-LAL: Drug Compound Generation Using Multi-Fidelity Latent Space Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current generative models for drug discovery primarily use molecular docking as an oracle to guide the generation of active compounds. However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show real-world experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. We train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide generation of compounds with high predicted activity. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. We train MF-LAL with a novel active learning algorithm to further reduce computational cost. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean binding free energy score).</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of Cellular-Potts Agent-Based Models as a segmentation task using the U-Net neural network architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Segmentation and Analysis of Microbial Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the growth and metabolism of microbes provides critical insights into their evolutionary adaptations to harsh environments, which are essential for microbial research and biotechnology applications. In this study, we developed an AI-driven image analysis system to efficiently segment individual cells and quantitatively analyze key cellular features. This system is comprised of four main modules. First, a denoising algorithm enhances contrast and suppresses noise while preserving fine cellular details. Second, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables accurate, zero-shot segmentation of cells without additional training. Third, post-processing is applied to refine segmentation results by removing over-segmented masks. Finally, quantitative analysis algorithms extract essential cellular features, including average intensity, length, width, and volume. The results show that denoising and post-processing significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of SAM in this new domain. Without human annotations, the AI-driven pipeline automatically and efficiently outlines cellular boundaries, indexes them, and calculates key cellular parameters with high accuracy. This framework will enable efficient and automated quantitative analysis of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy images to advance research into microbial adaptations to grow and metabolism that allow extremophiles to thrive in their harsh habitats.</description>
