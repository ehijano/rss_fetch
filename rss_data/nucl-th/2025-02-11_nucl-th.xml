      <title>An MLE analysis on the relationship between the initial-state granularity and final-state flow factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to investigate the relationship between initial-state fluctuations and final-state anisotropies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The granularity of the initial state, reflecting fluctuations in the initial conditions (IC), is modeled using a peripheral tube model. Besides differential flow, our analysis focuses on a class of more sensitive observables known as flow factorization. Specifically, we evaluate these observables using MLE, an asymptotically normal and unbiased tool in standard statistical inference. Our findings show that the resulting differential flow remains essentially unchanged for different IC defined by the peripheral tube model. The resulting harmonic coefficients obtained using MLE and multi-particle cumulants are found to be consistent. However, the calculated flow factorizations show significant variations depending on both the IC and the estimators, which is attributed to their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. Thus, we argue that MLE offers a compelling alternative to standard methods such as multi-particle correlators, particularly for sensitive observables constructed from higher moments of the azimuthal distribution.</description>

      <title>Robust linear correlations related to slope of nuclear symmetry energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With random interaction calculation, we observed the robust linear correlation between neutron skin thickness ($\Delta R_{\rm np}$)/charge radius difference of mirror nuclei ($\Delta R_{\rm mirr}$) and the isospin asymmetry ($I=\frac{N-Z}{A}$). Shape coexistence is introduced to explain the obvious deviation of $^{18}$O/Ne $\Delta R_{\rm mirr}$ from the $\Delta R_{\rm mirr}-I$ linearity. We also observe the slope of such linearity correlation ($C_{\rm np}$ or $C_{\rm mirr}$) is also robustly and linearly correlated to the slope of the symmetry energy ($L$) against nucleon density at equilibrium density in the nuclear equation of state. Such linear correlation is further explained with intrinsic structural similarity between $L$ and the symmetry energy coefficient ($J$). It is also adopted to constrain $L$ to $20\sim 36$ MeV. Considering the deviation of $^{18}$O/Ne $\Delta R_{\rm mirr}$, the 1$\sigma$ range of $L$ is further reduced to $28\sim 36$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Delta isobar resonance effects on nuclear matrix elements for double and single beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for double and single beta decays are crucial for studying neutrino properties beyond and within the standard model. The NMEs consist mainly of the spin isospin components. The delta isobar resonance, which is strongly excited by the qualk spin isospin excitation, is shown to quench the spin isospin NMEs by a coefficient around 0.7. Impact of the delta resonance on neutrino studies in nuclei is discused.</description>

      <title>Octupole correlations in superdeformed bands of $^{56}$Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projected multi-dimensionally-constrained relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model was employed to calculate the potential energy surface of the high-spin states in $^{56}\text{Ni}$. It is pointed out for the first time that possible octupole deformations exist for the positive and negative parity superdeformed bands in $^{56}\text{Ni}$, with deformations $\beta_{30}\sim0.14$ and $\beta_{30}\sim0.24$, respectively, along with a large prolate deformation of $\beta_{20}\sim 0.42$. These octupole deformations are induced by the coupling between $2p_{3/2}$ and $1g_{9/2}$ orbits at the deformation $\beta_{20}\sim 0.4$. The calculated excitation energies of the two rotational bands are consistent with the observed superdeformed bands of $^{56}\text{Ni}$. In addition, two rotational bands are predicted, consisting of one superdeformed band with negative parity and one hyperdeformed bands with positive parity.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial, tensor, and scalar charges and $\sigma$-terms in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon axial, scalar and tensor charges at the continuum limit by analyzing three $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermion ensembles with all quark masses tuned to approximately their physical values. We include all contributions from valence and sea quarks. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic errors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon isovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the experimental value. We compute the axial, tensor and scalar charges for each quark flavor. The axial charge provides crucial information on the intrinsic spin carried by quark in the nucleon and the the latter two provide input for experimental searches of physics beyond the standard model. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\sigma$-terms and find $\sigma_{\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$ MeV, for the strange $\sigma_{s}=30(17)$ MeV and for the charm $\sigma_{c}=82(29)$ MeV. We also present preliminary results on the isovector quantities using a fourth ensemble at smaller lattice spacing.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of quarkonia in vortical quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits a significant signal. We propose a possible mechanism for spin alignment through spin dependent dissociation of quarkonia in a vortical quark-gluon plasma. The spin dependent dissociation is realized through inelastic scattering between constituents of quarkonium and those of quark-gluon plasma polarized by the vorticity. The spin dependent dissociation rate is found to depend on the directions of vorticity, quantization axis, and quark momentum. We implement our results in a dissociation dominated evolution model for quarkonia in the Bjorken flow, finding the spin $0$ state is slightly suppressed compared to the average of the other two, which is consistent with the sign found in experiments. We also find absence of logarithmic enhancement in binding energy in the vortical correction to dissociation rate, which is understood from the requirement that a spin dependent dissociation can only come from quark coupling to a pair of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field.</description>

      <title>Insights into the $\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report novel theoretical results for the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition, utilizing a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) formalism. In this approach, both nucleon, $N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+$, and $\Delta(1232)$'s parity partner, $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, are treated as quark-diquark composites, with their internal structures governed accordingly by a tractable truncation of the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Nonpointlike quark+quark (diquark) correlations within baryons, which are deeply tied to the processes driving hadron mass generation, are inherently dynamic in the sense that they continually break apart and recombine guided by the Faddeev kernel. For the nucleon, isoscalar-scalar and isovector-axial-vector diquarks dominate, while the $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ state only includes contributions from isovector-axial-vector diquarks because the SCI-interaction excludes isovector-vector diquarks. Once the Faddeev wave function of the baryons involved in the electromagnetic transition is normalized taking into account that its elastic electric form factor must be one at the on-shell photon point, we compute the transition form factors that describe the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ reaction and, using algebraic relations, derive the corresponding helicity amplitudes. When comparing with experiment, our findings highlight a strong sensitivity of these observables to the internal structure of baryons, offering valuable insights. Although the SCI-framework has obvious limitations, its algebraic simplicity provides analytical predictions that serve as useful benchmarks for guiding more refined studies within QCD-based DSEs frameworks.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Screening Mass at Finite Temperature and Magnetic Field from Lattice QCD with Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the screening mass of pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field is crucial for comprehending the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe or inside neutron stars. Additionally, in heavy ion collisions, strong magnetic fields are generated, which could significantly influence the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The study of these screening masses provides insight into the modifications of mesonic properties in such environments, which is essential for the theoretical understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Here, we present continuum estimated lattice QCD results on the screening mass of neutral pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperatures and nonzero magnetic fields. The simulations used (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations using physical quark masses employing the HISQ/tree action. The continuum estimation was carried out using lattices having temporal extents $N_\tau$ = 8, 12, and 16, all having aspect ratio $N_\sigma/N_\tau$ = 4. The investigated temperature ranges from 145 MeV to 166 MeV, while the magnetic field strength varies from 0 to 1 GeV$^2$. We discuss the dependence of the screening masses of various neutral pseudoscalar mesons on temperature, magnetic field strength, and quark mass.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of ccbar Potential from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter Wave Function in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gauge dependence of $c\bar{c}$ potentials extracted from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. The potentials are obtained using the HAL QCD potential method, with an extension introduced by Kawanai and Sasaki for self-consistent determination of the charm quark mass. A systematic comparison is conducted between results obtained in the Coulomb and Landau gauges. The numerical calculations are performed using 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations with the charm quark treated in the quenched approximation. We find that the central potentials in both gauges show excellent agreement at short distances but exhibit discrepancies at large distances. We attribute these discrepancies to insufficient suppression of excited-state contamination in the Landau gauge, which affects the linear-rising behavior of the potential at large distance.</description>

      <title>Axialvector diqaurk Mass and quark-diquark potential in Sigma_c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axialvector diquark is studied by using 2+1 flavor Lattice QCD. Being a two-quark object, diquark has a non-neutral color charge. Hence the two-point correlators of diquark fields do not have a particle pole due to the color confinement of QCD, and it is not straightforward to study the diquark mass by lattice QCD by using an exponential fit of a temporal two-point correlator. In order to avoid this difficulty, our strategy is to regard the diquark mass as a mass parameter of an effective quark-diquark model which is constructed by using an extended HAL QCD method based on equal-time quark-diquark Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. We attempt to calculate the axial-vector diquark mass and the quark-diquark potentials between a charm quark and an axial-vector diquark in the $\Sigma_c$ baryon. Lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation is performed by using the 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations generated on $32^3\times 64$ lattice by PACS-CS Collaboration which corresponds to the pion mass of about 700 MeV. As a result, a quark-diquark central potential of Cornell-type and a short-ranged spin-dependent potential are obtained. However, from a quantitative point of view, the ground state convergence of the NBS wave functions are not sufficient so that we obtain a larger string tension and a smaller axial-vector diquark mass than we have expected phenomenologically.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD $\bar \theta$ term with paramagnetic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental search for CP violation in paramagnetic atomic and molecular systems has made impressive progress in recent years. This has led to strong upper limits on the electron electric dipole moment. The same measurements can also be used to constrain hadronic sources of CP violation through CP-violating interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. We employ heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to compute such CP-violating semileptonic electron-nucleus interactions arising from the QCD theta term. We sharpen earlier results by determining the relevant short-distance effects and by an explicit two-loop calculation of meson-photon diagrams. We derive a bound of $|\bar{\theta}| &lt; 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence, based on HfF$^+$ experiments at JILA. A further experimental improvement of one to two orders of magnitude would make paramagnetic molecular electric dipole moment experiments competitive with the neutron and diamagnetic atom program in constraining strong CP violation and higher-dimensional CP-odd quark-gluon operators.</description>

Abstract: Neutron physics is one of the oldest branches of the experimental nuclear physics, but the investigation of the spontaneous neutron emission from the ground state along the neutron dripline is still at its beginning, in spite of the crucial importance for nuclear astrophysics. The proton dripline is much better investigated and a systematics of spontaneous proton half lives is available in terms of an exponential dependence upon the Coulomb parameter $\chi\sim Q^{-1/2}$, characterizing the outgoing irregular Coulomb wave in terms of the Q-value (Geiger-Nuttall law). Our purpose is to propose a similar simple systematics of spontaneous neutron half lives, but in terms of the nuclear reduced radius $\rho\sim Q^{1/2}$, characterizing the "neutral" outgoing irregular Neumann wave. We evidence the important role of the angular momentum carried by the emitted neutron. The influence of the neutron wave function generated by a Woods-Saxon nuclear mean field is also analyzed.</description>

Abstract: $^6$Li is usually treated as an $\alpha+p+n$ three-body system, and the validity of this picture is important for understanding $^6$Li reactions. The ($p$,$2p$) reaction is a powerful method to study the structure of valence nucleons in $^6$Li. Recently, the new experimental data of the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction have been obtained and should be analyzed. We investigate the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction using the $\alpha+p+n$ three-body wave function of $^6$Li and study the validity of this model. We calculate the $^6$Li wave function by using Gaussian expansion method, and the function is used to obtain the relative wave function between $p$ and $^5$He. We combine the relative wave function with the distorted wave impulse approximation. Our results reproduce the experimental data of the triple differential cross section within about 10\% difference in the absolute values, and contributions from both $p$- and $s$-wave states of $^5$He in $^6$Li are found to be important. We can qualitatively understand the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction by describing $^6$Li with the three-body model. Contribution from the $s$-wave component is important in reproducing the experimental data in the zero recoil-momentum region.</description>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal invariance violation effect in $\bm{dd}$ scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formalism has been developed for calculating the signal of violation of $T$ invariance, provided that $P$ invariance is preserved during the scattering of tensor-polarized deuterons on vector-polarized ones based on the Glauber theory with the full consideration of spin dependence of $NN$ elastic scattering amplitudes and spin structure of colliding deuterons. The numerical calculations have been carried out in the range of laboratory proton energies $T_p=0.1$--$1.2$ GeV using the SAID database for spin amplitudes and in the energy region of the SPD NICA experiment corresponding to the invariant mass of the interacting nucleon pairs $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 2.5$--$25$ GeV, using two phenomenological models of $pN$ elastic scattering. It is found that only one type of the $T$ non-invariant $P$-invariant $NN$ interaction gives a non-zero contribution to the signal in question, that is important for isolating an unknown constant of this interaction from the corresponding data.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics in the Density Frame: Numerical Tests and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics in the Density Frame for one-dimensional fluid flows. The Density Frame is a formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics that is first-order in time, requires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our results to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. Additionally, the Density Frame results remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicability. We also compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrodynamic theory developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) and a well-known M\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type hydrodynamics code, MUSIC, which is commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Investigating radial flow-like effects via pseudorapidity and transverse spherocity dependence of particle production in pp collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) like signatures in high multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions, have compelled the heavy-ion physics community to re-examine small collision systems for proper baseline studies. Event-shape-based studies in pp collisions have succeeded to a certain extent in identifying the rare events mimicking such heavy-ion-like behaviour. In this study, we incorporate PYTHIA8 and AMPT to study radial flow-like signatures in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV as a function of transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity. The selection of softer events possibly carrying heavy-ion-like features is performed using the transverse spherocity event-shape observable. As the particle production mechanism in midrapidity differs greatly from the forward rapidity, a pseudorapidity-dependent study is meaningful. Keeping ALICE 3 upgrades at the LHC in mind, this study aims to demonstrate the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of the mean transverse momentum, particle ratios, and kinetic freezeout parameters in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using PYTHIA8. We observe that the isotropic events show enhanced radial-flow effects in all multiplicity classes, however, the jetty events show signatures of the radial flow-like effects only in high-multiplicity events. For the first time, we show the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of partonic modification factor in pp collisions, which clearly shows that by choosing transverse spherocity, one can directly probe the radial flow-like effects in pp collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Formation of twin compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries: Implications on eccentric and isolated millisecond pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, and others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs).
  We studied the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigated whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, leaves an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit.
  We simulated mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main-sequence companion and followed the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assumed a multi-polytrope equation of state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints.
  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition can occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition can take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick, then the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or re-configured into an ultra-wide orbit.
  Our findings suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long orbital periods (&gt; 50 d) could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation by electrically charged fermions embedded in a rotating medium in an external magnetic field. We compute the dependence of the radiation intensity on the angular velocity $\Omega$ of the rotating medium for fermion polarizations along and opposite the magnetic field direction in intense subcritical fields. The polarization dependence of the photon radiation results in the Sokolov--Ternov effect -- the radiative polarization of fermions. We study the dependence of the degree of polarziation on $\Omega$. We found that rotation significantly changes the degree of polarization. We show that the rotating quark-gluon plasma acquires a finite magnetic moment that exhibits complex dependence on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Three flavor QCD phase transition with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the $N_f=3$ QCD phase transition using M\"{o}bius domain wall fermions. Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \times 12\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \times 12 \times 16$ and $36^3 \times 12 \times 16$ lattices reported in earlier studies, we observe that the transition is consistent with a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_f^{\mathrm{\overline {MS}}}(2\, \mathrm{GeV}) \sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different sizes in the 5th direction.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{s}\alpha_{em})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair-production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision-kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>
