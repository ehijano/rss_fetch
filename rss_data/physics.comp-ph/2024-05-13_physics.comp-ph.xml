      <title>Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>

      <title>Transferable Neural Wavefunctions for Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-Learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently emerged as a highly accurate approach for finding approximate solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation. Despite its favorable scaling with the number of electrons, $\mathcal{O}(n_\text{el}^{4})$, the practical value of DL-VMC is limited by the high cost of optimizing the neural network weights for every system studied. To mitigate this problem, recent research has proposed optimizing a single neural network across multiple systems, reducing the cost per system. Here we extend this approach to solids, where similar but distinct calculations using different geometries, boundary conditions, and supercell sizes are often required. We show how to optimize a single ansatz across all of these variations, reducing the required number of optimization steps by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we exploit the transfer capabilities of a pre-trained network. We successfully transfer a network, pre-trained on 2x2x2 supercells of LiH, to 3x3x3 supercells. This reduces the number of optimization steps required to simulate the large system by a factor of 50 compared to previous work.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a binary mixture of sticky spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dependence of range of attractive potential on the phase separation of 2-D binary systems. Through extensive simulations and analysis, we show that when the range of attractive interactions approaches the sticky sphere limit, the system undergoes a phase separation at lower temperature. Further reduction in temperature causes the system to mix again. These mixing-demixing-mixing transitions are of first order. Such phase separation is not observed for systems with larger interaction range. In the phase separated region of the phase diagram, one of the components of the mixture chooses to be in crystalline configuration, while other being in disordered state</description>

      <title>Breaking the Molecular Dynamics Timescale Barrier Using a Wafer-Scale System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have transformed our understanding of the nanoscale, driving breakthroughs in materials science, computational chemistry, and several other fields, including biophysics and drug design. Even on exascale supercomputers, however, runtimes are excessive for systems and timescales of scientific interest. Here, we demonstrate strong scaling of MD simulations on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine. By dedicating a processor core for each simulated atom, we demonstrate a 179-fold improvement in timesteps per second versus the Frontier GPU-based Exascale platform, along with a large improvement in timesteps per unit energy. Reducing every year of runtime to two days unlocks currently inaccessible timescales of slow microstructure transformation processes that are critical for understanding material behavior and function. Our dataflow algorithm runs Embedded Atom Method (EAM) simulations at rates over 270,000 timesteps per second for problems with up to 800k atoms. This demonstrated performance is unprecedented for general-purpose processing cores.</description>

      <title>Optimization Using Pathwise Algorithmic Derivatives of Electromagnetic Shower Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the well-known methods to approximate derivatives of expectancies computed by Monte-Carlo simulations, averages of pathwise derivatives are often the easiest one to apply. Computing them via algorithmic differentiation typically does not require major manual analysis and rewriting of the code, even for very complex programs like simulations of particle-detector interactions in high-energy physics. However, the pathwise derivative estimator can be biased if there are discontinuities in the program, which may diminish its value for applications.
  This work integrates algorithmic differentiation into the electromagnetic shower simulation code HepEmShow based on G4HepEm, allowing us to study how well pathwise derivatives approximate derivatives of energy depositions in a sampling calorimeter with respect to parameters of the beam and geometry. We found that when multiple scattering is disabled in the simulation, means of pathwise derivatives converge quickly to their expected values, and these are close to the actual derivatives of the energy deposition. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of this novel gradient estimator for stochastic gradient-based optimization in a model example.</description>

      <title>Searches for the BSM scenarios at the LHC using decision tree based machine learning algorithms: A comparative study and review of Random Forest, Adaboost, XGboost and LightGBM frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are now being extensively used in our daily lives, spanning across diverse industries as well as academia. In the field of high energy physics (HEP), the most common and challenging task is separating a rare signal from a much larger background. The boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm has been a cornerstone of the high energy physics for analyzing event triggering, particle identification, jet tagging, object reconstruction, event classification, and other related tasks for quite some time. This article presents a comprehensive overview of research conducted by both HEP experimental and phenomenological groups that utilize decision tree algorithms in the context of the Standard Model and Supersymmetry (SUSY). We also summarize the basic concept of machine learning and decision tree algorithm along with the working principle of \texttt{Random Forest}, \texttt{AdaBoost} and two gradient boosting frameworks, such as \texttt{XGBoost}, and \texttt{LightGBM}. Using a case study of electroweakino productions at the high luminosity LHC, we demonstrate how these algorithms lead to improvement in the search sensitivity compared to traditional cut-based methods in both compressed and non-compressed R-parity conserving SUSY scenarios. The effect of different hyperparameters and their optimization, feature importance study using SHapley values are also discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>An Unstructured Body-of-Revolution Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Algorithm with Radial Perfectly Matched Layers and Dual Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel electromagnetic particle-in-cell algorithm has been developed for fully kinetic plasma simulations on unstructured (irregular) meshes in complex body-of-revolution geometries. The algorithm, implemented in the BORPIC++ code, utilizes a set of field scalings and a coordinate mapping, reducing the Maxwell field problem in a cylindrical system to a Cartesian finite element Maxwell solver in the meridian plane. The latter obviates the cylindrical coordinate singularity in the symmetry axis. The choice of an unstructured finite element discretization enhances the geometrical flexibility of the BORPIC++ solver compared to the more traditional finite difference solvers. Symmetries in Maxwell's equations are explored to decompose the problem into two dual polarization states with isomorphic representations that enable code reuse. The particle-in-cell scatter and gather steps preserve charge-conservation at the discrete level. Our previous algorithm (BORPIC+) discretized the E and B field components of TE-phi and TM-phi polarizations on the finite element (primal) mesh. A cylindrical perfectly matched layer is implemented as a boundary condition in the radial direction to simulate open space problems, with periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. We investigate effects of charged particles moving next to the cylindrical perfectly matched layer. We model azimuthal currents arising from rotational motion of charged rings, which produce TM-phi polarized fields. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the first application of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of simulations of the channeling process with account for the ionizing collisions that accompany the passage of a charged projectile in a crystalline medium. The simulations have been performed by means of the \MBNExplorer software package. taking into account that ionizing collisions are random, fast and local they can be incorporated into the classical molecular dynamics framework according to their probabilities. The description of this methodology is given in the paper. The case studies presented refer to channeling of 195, 270 \&amp; 855 MeV electrons and of 270 \&amp; 500 MeV positrons in single diamond crystals along the (111) (electrons) and (110) (positrons) planar directions.</description>

Abstract: The Prelle-Singer method allows determining an elementary first integral admitted by a polynomial vector field in the plane. It is a semi-algorithm whose nonlinear step consists of determining the Darboux polynomials of the vector field. In this article we construct a linear procedure to determine the Darboux polynomials present in the integrating factor of a polynomial vector field in the plane. Next, we extend the procedure to deal with rational 2ODEs that admit an elementary first integral</description>

      <title>Beyond single-reference fixed-node approximation in ab initio Diffusion Monte Carlo using antisymmetrized geminal power applied to systems with hundreds of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is an exact technique to project out the ground state (GS) of a Hamiltonian. Since the GS is always bosonic, in fermionic systems the projection needs to be carried out while imposing anti-symmetric constraints, which is a nondeterministic polynomial hard problem. In practice, therefore, the application of DMC on electronic structure problems is made by employing the fixed-node (FN) approximation, consisting of performing DMC with the constraint of having a fixed predefined nodal surface. How do we get the nodal surface? The typical approach, applied in systems having up to hundreds, or even thousands of electrons, is to obtain the nodal surface from a preliminary mean-field approach (typically, a density functional theory calculation) used to obtain a single Slater determinant. This is known as {\emph{single reference}}. In this paper, we propose a new approach, applicable to systems as large as the C$_{60}$ fullerene, which improves the nodes by going beyond the single reference. In practice, we employ an implicitly multireference ansatz (Antisymmetrized Geminal power wavefunction constraint with molecular orbitals), initialized on the preliminary mean-field approach, which is relaxed by optimizing a few parameters of the wave function determining the nodal surface by minimizing the FN-DMC energy. We highlight the improvements of the proposed approach over the standard single reference method on several examples and, where feasible, the computational gain over the standard multireference ansatz, which makes the methods applicable to large systems. We also show that physical properties relying on relative energies, such as binding energies, are affordable and reliable within the proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide as they offer several routes to design materials with novel features and wide-ranging applications. Unfortunately, at present, vdW heterostructures are restricted to a small number of stackable layers, due to the weak vdW forces holding adjacent layers together. In this work, we report on computational studies of a bulk vdW material consisting of alternating TiS2 and TiSe2 (TSS) vertically arranged layers as a potential candidate for anode applications. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the effect of high entropy on several electrochemically relevant properties of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at the transition metal site (Ti4+). We also study the solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) using AIMD to determine Li-coordination. Based on the properties computed using DFT and AIMD we propose that high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) might possess improved electrochemical performance over standard TSS-HS. Factors that could improve the performance of TSS-HE are 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-Oxygen), 3) Better electron mobility, 4) Wider operational voltage window, and 5) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggest that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>The impact of electron inertia on collisional laser absorption for high energy density plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-power lasers are at the forefront of science in many domains. While their fields are still far from reaching the Schwinger limit, they have been used in extreme regimes, to successfully accelerate particles at high energies, or to reproduce phenomena observed in astrophysical settings. However, our understanding of laser plasma interactions is limited by numerical simulations, which are very expensive to run as short temporal and spatial scales need to be resolved explicitly. Under such circumstances, a non-collisional approach to model laser-plasma interactions becomes numerically expensive. Even a collisional approach, modeling the electrons and ions as independent fluids, is slow in practice. In both cases, the limitation comes from a direct computation of electron motion. In this work, we show how the generalized Ohm's law captures collisional absorption phenomena through the macroscopic interactions of laser fields, electron flows, and ion dynamics. This approach replicates several features usually associated with explicit electron motion, such as cut-off density, reflection and absorption. As the electron dynamics is now solved implicitly, the spatial and temporal scales of this model fit well between multi-fluid and standard magnetohydrodynamics scales, allowing to study a new class of problems that would be too expensive to solve numerically with other methods.</description>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of computing hardware different from the traditional CPU+RAM model in data centers around the world mandates a change in the design of event generators for the Large Hadron Collider, in order to provide economically and ecologically sustainable simulations for the high-luminosity era of the LHC. Parton-level event generation is one of the most computationally demanding parts of the simulation and is therefore a prime target for improvements. We present a production-ready leading-order parton-level event generation framework capable of utilizing most modern hardware and discuss its performance in the standard candle processes of vector boson and top-quark pair production with up to five additional jets.</description>

The flow map is evolved numerically and exponential resolution in linear time is obtained. Global third-order convergence in space and time is shown and conservation properties are assessed. For benchmarking, we consider linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the two-stream instability. We compare the results with a Fourier pseudo-spectral method. The extreme fine-scale resolution features are illustrated showing the method's capabilities to efficiently treat filamentation in fusion plasma simulations.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>

Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>
