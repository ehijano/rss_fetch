      <title>AFDM for LEO Inter-Satellite Links: Path-Level CSI Prediction and CRLB-Guided Pre-Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) inter-satellite links must cope with strongly doubly selective channels and aged channel state information (CSI). In this paper, the term ``sensing'' refers to the receiver-side identifiability of a small set of dominant delay--Doppler path parameters, quantified via CRLB-type proxies, rather than a full-fledged target-sensing pipeline. Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a sparse delay--Doppler (DD) representation well suited to such channels, yet most existing AFDM designs assume ideal CSI, operate on grid-based channel coefficients, and optimize only communication performance. This paper proposes a two-stage AFDM-based ISAC framework for mobile LEO ISLs that explicitly operates under predicted CSI. In Stage~I, we model the channel by a small number of dominant specular paths and perform sequence prediction directly on their complex gains, delays, and Dopplers, from which we reconstruct the AFDM DD-domain kernel used as the sole instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. In Stage~II, we design a sensing-aware AFDM pre-equalizer by augmenting the classical minimum mean-square error (MMSE) solution with a term obtained from Cram\'er--Rao-type sensitivity measures evaluated under the predicted channel model, leading to a first-order surrogate of a CRLB-regularized pre-equalizer with a single tuning parameter that controls the communication--sensing tradeoff. Simulation results for representative LEO ISL trajectories show that the proposed path-level predictor improves effective-kernel reconstruction over AFDM-unaware baselines, and that, under predicted CSI, the sensing-aware pre-equalizer significantly improves sensing-oriented metrics over outdated-CSI baselines while keeping symbol error rates close to a communication-oriented MMSE design with only modest additional complexity.</description>

      <title>Environment-to-Link ISAC with Space-Weather Sensing for Ka-Band LEO Downlinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ka-band low-Earth-orbit (LEO) downlinks can suffer second-scale reliability collapses during flare-driven ionospheric disturbances, where fixed fade margins and reactive adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) are either overly conservative or too slow. This paper presents a GNSS-free, link-internal predictive controller that senses the same downlink via a geometry-free dual-carrier phase observable at 10~Hz: a high-pass filter and template-based onset detector, followed by a four-state nearly-constant-velocity Kalman filter, estimate $\Delta$VTEC and its rate, and a short look-ahead (60~s) yields an endpoint outage probability used as a risk gate to trigger one-step discrete MCS down-switch and pilot-time update with hysteresis. Evaluation uses physics-informed log replay driven by real GOES X-ray flare morphologies under a disjoint-day frozen-calibration protocol, with uncertainty reported via paired moving-block bootstrap. Across stressed 60~s windows, the controller reduces peak BLER by 25--30\% and increases goodput by 0.10--0.15~bps/Hz versus no-adaptation baselines under a unified link-level abstraction. The loop runs in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per 0.1~s epoch (about 0.042~ms measured), making on-board implementation feasible, and scope and deployment considerations for dispersion-dominated events are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Accuracy Estimation in a Wi-Fi-based Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a concept of a dynamic accuracy estimation method, in which the localization errors are derived based on the measurement results used by the positioning algorithm. The concept was verified experimentally in a Wi\nobreakdash-Fi based indoor positioning system, where several regression methods were tested (linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks). The highest positioning error estimation accuracy was achieved for random forest regression, with a mean absolute error of 0.72 m.</description>

      <title>System-Level Comparison of Multimodal and In-Band mmWave Sensing for Beam Prediction in 6G ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can reduce beam-training overhead in mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links by enabling in-band sensing-based beam prediction, while exteroceptive sensors can further enhance the prediction accuracy. This work develop a system-level framework that evaluates camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and in-band mmWave power, both individually and in multimodal fusion using the DeepSense-6G Scenario-33 dataset. A latency-aware neural network composed of lightweight convolutional (CNN) and multilayer-perceptron (MLP) encoders predict a 64-beam index. We assess performance using Top-k accuracy alongside spectral-efficiency (SE) gap, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gap, rate loss, and end-to-end latency. Results show that the mmWave power vector is a strong standalone predictor, and fusing exteroceptive sensors with it preserves high performance: mmWave alone and mmWave+LiDAR/GPS/Radar achieve 98% Top-5 accuracy, while mmWave+camera achieves 94% Top-5 accuracy. The proposed framework establishes calibrated baselines for 6G ISAC-assisted beam prediction in V2I systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Framework for Robust Node Deployment in Cooperative ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates node deployment strategies for robust multi-node cooperative localization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks.We first analyze how steering vector correlation across different positions affects localization performance and introduce a novel distance-weighted correlation metric to characterize this effect. Building upon this insight, we propose a deployment optimization framework that minimizes the maximum weighted steering vector correlation by optimizing simultaneously node positions and array orientations, thereby enhancing worst-case network robustness. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve this min-max optimization, yielding optimized node positions and array orientations. Extensive simulations using both multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and neural-network (NN)-based localization validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant improvements in robust localization performance.</description>

      <title>NeuroSSM: Multiscale Differential State-Space Modeling for Context-Aware fMRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fMRI analysis requires sensitivity to temporal structure across multiple scales, as BOLD signals encode cognitive processes that emerge from fast transient dynamics to slower, large-scale fluctuations. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods.</description>

      <title>A 2.5 $\mu$W 30 nV/$\surd$Hz Instrumentation Amplifier for Bioimpedance Sensors with Source Degenerated Current Mirror and DTMOS Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power and low-noise instrumentation amplifier (IA) tailored for bioimpedance sensing applications. The design originates from a gain-boosted flipped voltage follower (FVF) transconductance (TC) stage and integrates two complementary circuit techniques to improve the noise performance. To achieve an optimal balance between input-referred noise and available voltage headroom, a source-degenerated current mirror (SDCM) is adopted, resulting in reducing the input-referred noise by 7.95% compared with a conventional current mirror structure. In addition, a dynamic threshold MOSFET (DTMOS) scheme is employed to enhance the effective transconductance, leading to a further 11.66% reduction in input-referred noise. Simulated in a 28 nm CMOS process demonstrate that the proposed IA achieves an input-referred noise floor of 30 nV/$\surd$Hz and a bandwidth of 1.44 MHz, while consuming only 2.5 $\mu$W from a 0.8 V supply. Compared to the baseline design, the proposed approach achieves a 32.4% reduction in power consumption without degrading noise performance. The complete design parameters are open-sourced in this paper, to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future developments.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antennas in Blockage-Aware Environments: Modeling, Design, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna (PA) systems have recently emerged as a promising member of the flexible-antenna family due to their ability to dynamically establish line-of-sight (LoS) links. While most existing studies assume ideal environments without obstacles, practical indoor deployments are often obstacle-rich, where LoS blockage significantly degrades performance. This paper investigates pinching-antenna systems in blockage-aware environments by developing a deterministic model for cylinder-shaped obstacles that precisely characterizes LoS conditions without relying on stochastic approximations. Based on this model, a special case is first studied where each PA serves a single user and can only be deployed at discrete positions along the waveguide. In this case, the waveguide-user assignment is obtained via the Hungarian algorithm, and PA positions are refined using a surrogate-assisted block-coordinate search. Then, a general case is considered where each PA serves all users and can be continuously placed along the waveguide. In this case, beamforming and PA positions are jointly optimized by a weighted minimum mean square error integrated deep deterministic policy gradient (WMMSE-DDPG) approach to address non-smooth LoS transitions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve system throughput and LoS connectivity compared with benchmark methods. Moreover, the results reveal that pinching-antenna systems can effectively leverage obstacles to suppress co-channel interference, converting potential blockages into performance gains.</description>

      <title>KAN-AE with Non-Linearity Score and Symbolic Regression for Energy-Efficient Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) with symbolic regression (SR) for energy-efficient channel coding. By using SR, we convert KAN-AEs into symbolic expressions, which enables low-complexity implementation and improved energy efficiency at the radios. To further enhance the efficiency, we introduce a new non-linearity score term in the SR process to help select lower-complexity equations when possible. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that KAN-AEs achieve competitive BLER performance while improving energy efficiency when paired with SR. We score the energy efficiency of a KAN-AE implementation using the proposed non-linearity metric and compare it to a multi-layer perceptron-based autoencoder (MLP-AE). Our experiment shows that the KAN-AE paired with SR uses 1.38 times less energy than the MLP-AE, supporting that KAN-AEs are a promising choice for energy-efficient deep learning-based channel coding.</description>

      <title>Joint Sparsity and Beamforming Design for RDARS-Aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antennas and reflecting surface (RDARS) has emerged as a promising architecture for communication and sensing performance enhancement. In particular, the new selection gain can be achieved by leveraging the dynamic working mode selection between connection and reflection modes, whereas low-complexity element configuration remains an open issue. In this paper, we consider a RDARS-assisted communication system, where the connected elements are formed as a uniform sparse array for simplified mode configuration while achieving enlarged physical array aperture. The sum rate maximization problem is then formulated by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming matrices and sparsity of connected element array. For the special cases of a single user equipment (UE) and two UEs, the optimal sparsity designs are derived in closed-form. Then, for an arbitrary number of UEs, a weighted minimum mean-square error-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of optimizing the sparsity and the effectiveness of low-complexity sparsity optimization.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01791v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Lossless Reciprocal MiLAC Architectures in Multi-User Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC)-aided beamforming, which processes the transmitted symbols fully in the analog domain, has recently emerged as a promising alternative to fully digital and hybrid beamforming architectures for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While prior studies have shown that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC can achieve the same capacity as digital beamforming in a single-user MIMO network, its performance in multi-user scenarios remains unknown. To answer this question, in this work, we establish a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) network with a MiLAC-aided transmitter, and investigate its sum-rate performance. Based on the microwave network theory, we first prove that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC cannot achieve the same performance as digital beamforming in a general MU-MISO network. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem and develop an efficient optimization framework to jointly optimize the power allocation and the scattering matrix for MiLAC. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MiLAC is a promising architecture for future extremely large-scale MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler-Resilient LEO Satellite OFDM Transmission with Affine Frequency Domain Pilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system suffers from severe Doppler shifts, while {the Doppler-resilient affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) transmission suffers from significantly high processing complexity in data detection}. In this paper, we explore the channel estimation gain of affine frequency (AF) domain pilot to enhance the OFDM transmission under high mobility. Specifically, we propose a novel AF domain pilot embedding scheme for satellite-ground downlink OFDM systems for capturing the channel characteristics. By exploiting the autoregressive (AR) property of adjacent channels, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based predictor is designed to replace conventional interpolation operation in OFDM channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme significantly outperforms conventional OFDM scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) under high Doppler scenarios, thus paving a new way for the design of next generation non-terrestrial network (NTN) communication systems.</description>

      <title>Beam-Brainstorm: A Generative Site-Specific Beamforming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately understanding the propagation environment is a fundamental challenge in site-specific beamforming (SSBF). This paper proposes a novel generative SSBF (GenSSBF) solution, which represents a paradigm shift from conventional unstructured prediction to joint-structure modeling. First, considering the fundamental differences between beam generation and conventional image synthesis, a unified GenSSBF framework is proposed, which includes a site profile, a wireless prompting module, and a generator. Second, a beam-brainstorm (BBS) solution is proposed as an instantiation of this GenSSBF framework. Specifically, the site profile is configured by transforming channel data from spatial domain to a reversible latent space via discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To facilitate practical deployment, the wireless prompt is constructed from the reference signal received power (RSRP) measured using a small number of DFT-beams. Finally, the generator is developed using a customized conditional diffusion model. Rather than relying on a meticulously designed global codebook, BBS directly generates diverse and high-fidelity user-specific beams guided by the wireless prompts. Simulation results on accurate ray-tracing datasets demonstrate that BBS can achieve near-optimal beamforming gain while drastically reducing the beam sweeping overhead, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments.</description>

      <title>Backscatter-Assisted High-Speed Rail Communications in Straight Tunnel Environments: Effects of Tag Number and Phase Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication is a promising technology to enhance the signal strength received by the receiver in straight tunnel environments. The impact of the number of tags and their phase adjustment on system performance remains a challenging issue though. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the channel gain of backscatter-assisted communication with multiple tags in straight tunnels. In particular, we derive the probabilities that the backscatter link gain is greater than the direct link under adjustable and random phase assumptions by applying the Gaussian and Gamma approximations to derive tractable expressions. The simulation results show that phaseadjustable tags significantly improve the channel gain of the backscatter links compared to the random phase case. Moreover, the number of tags has an upper threshold for an effective tag deployment pattern. These insights provide valuable guidelines for the efficient design of backscatter communication systems in tunnel environments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-power Monostatic Backscatter Platform with Phase-Aware Channel Estimation and System-Level Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel channel-estimation (CE) method that mitigates residual phase drifts in backscatter links and a full hardware and signal-processing pipeline for a single-antenna monostatic system. The platform comprises a semi-passive tag, a software-defined radio (SDR) reader, and a 2x1 planar Yagi-Uda array (7 dBi with higher than 30 dB isolation) operating at 2.4 ~ 2.5 GHz. The developed backscatter fading model accounts for round-trip propagation and temporal correlation, and employs an analytically derived resource-optimal pilot allocation strategy. At the receiver, optimized least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) CE with pilot-aided carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation feed a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer to suppress ISI. The prototype delivers 500 kbps at 1 m with power of 158 uW (SDR baseband) and 10 uW (RF switch), yielding 320 pJ/bit. OOK and BPSK modulations achieve measured EVMs of 2.97 % and 4.02 %, respectively. Performance is validated by BER measurements and successful reconstruction of a full-color image in an over-the-air experiment. The results demonstrate an ultra-low-power, multimedia-capable backscatter IoT link and provide practical hardware-software co-design guidance for scalable deployments.</description>

      <title>Learned Hemodynamic Coupling Inference in Resting-State Functional MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measurement of neuronal activity via hemodynamic responses that vary across brain regions and individuals. Ignoring this hemodynamic variability can bias downstream connectivity estimates. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters themselves may serve as important imaging biomarkers. Estimating spatially varying hemodynamics from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is therefore an important but challenging blind inverse problem, since both the latent neural activity and the hemodynamic coupling are unknown. In this work, we propose a methodology for inferring hemodynamic coupling on the cortical surface from rsfMRI. Our approach avoids the highly unstable joint recovery of neural activity and hemodynamics by marginalizing out the latent neural signal and basing inference on the resulting marginal likelihood. To enable scalable, high-resolution estimation, we employ a deep neural network combined with conditional normalizing flows to accurately approximate this intractable marginal likelihood, while enforcing spatial coherence through priors defined on the cortical surface that admit sparse representations. The proposed approach is extensively validated using synthetic data and real fMRI datasets, demonstrating clear improvements over current methods for hemodynamic estimation and downstream connectivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Wireless Dataset Similarity: Measuring Distances in Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a task- and model-aware framework for measuring similarity between wireless datasets, enabling applications such as dataset selection/augmentation, simulation-to-real (sim2real) comparison, task-specific synthetic data generation, and informing decisions on model training/adaptation to new deployments. We evaluate candidate dataset distance metrics by how well they predict cross-dataset transferability: if two datasets have a small distance, a model trained on one should perform well on the other. We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks. For this task, we derive a label-aware distance by integrating supervised UMAP and penalties for dataset imbalance. Across both tasks, the resulting distances outperform traditional baselines and consistently exhibit stronger correlations with model transferability, supporting task-relevant comparisons between wireless datasets.</description>

      <title>Tiny Machine Learning for Real-Time Aquaculture Monitoring: A Case Study in Morocco</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, is a rapidly growing industry facing challenges such as water quality fluctuations, disease outbreaks, and inefficient feed management. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of the Optimal Detector for Sub-THz Multi-Hop Relays with Unknown Prior: Over-the-Air Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amplify and forward (AF) relaying is a viable strategy to extend the coverage of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) links, but inevitably propagates noise, leading to cumulative degradation across multiple hops. At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations.</description>

      <title>Seamlessly Natural: Image Stitching with Natural Appearance Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SENA (SEamlessly NAtural), a geometry-driven image stitching approach that prioritizes structural fidelity in challenging real-world scenes characterized by parallax and depth variation. Conventional image stitching relies on homographic alignment, but this rigid planar assumption often fails in dual-camera setups with significant scene depth, leading to distortions such as visible warps and spherical bulging. SENA addresses these fundamental limitations through three key contributions. First, we propose a hierarchical affine-based warping strategy, combining global affine initialization with local affine refinement and smooth free-form deformation. This design preserves local shape, parallelism, and aspect ratios, thereby avoiding the hallucinated structural distortions commonly introduced by homography-based models. Second, we introduce a geometry-driven adequate zone detection mechanism that identifies parallax-minimized regions directly from the disparity consistency of RANSAC-filtered feature correspondences, without relying on semantic segmentation. Third, building upon this adequate zone, we perform anchor-based seamline cutting and segmentation, enforcing a one-to-one geometric correspondence across image pairs by construction, which effectively eliminates ghosting, duplication, and smearing artifacts in the final panorama.
  Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets demonstrate that SENA achieves alignment accuracy comparable to leading homography-based methods, while significantly outperforming them in critical visual metrics such as shape preservation, texture integrity, and overall visual realism.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real SAR Image Restoration: Metadata-Driven Models for Joint Despeckling and Sidelobes Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides valuable information about the Earth's surface under all weather and illumination conditions. However, the inherent phenomenon of speckle and the presence of sidelobes around bright targets pose challenges for accurate interpretation of SAR imagery. Most existing SAR image restoration methods address despeckling and sidelobes reduction as separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly performs both tasks using neural networks (NNs) trained on a realistic SAR simulated dataset generated with MOCEM. Inference can then be performed on real SAR images, demonstrating effective simulation to real (Sim2Real) transferability. Additionally, we incorporate acquisition metadata as auxiliary input to the NNs, demonstrating improved restoration performance.</description>

      <title>Real Time NILM Based Power Monitoring of Identical Induction Motors Representing Cutting Machines in Textile Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The textile industry in Bangladesh is one of the most energy-intensive sectors, yet its monitoring practices remain largely outdated, resulting in inefficient power usage and high operational costs. To address this, we propose a real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)-based framework tailored for industrial applications, with a focus on identical motor-driven loads representing textile cutting machines. A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of NILM in industrial contexts, offering insights into future improvements such as higher-frequency data collection, larger-scale datasets and advanced deep learning approaches for handling identical loads.</description>

Abstract: We study the filtering and smoothing problem for continuous-time linear Gaussian systems. While classical approaches such as the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother provide recursive formulas for the conditional mean and covariance, we present a pathwise perspective that characterizes the smoothing error dynamics as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As an application, we show that standard filtering and smoothing equations can be uniformly derived as corollaries of our main theorem. In particular, we provide the first mathematically rigorous derivation of the Bryson-Frazier smoother in the continuous-time setting. Beyond offering a more transparent understanding of the smoothing distribution, our formulation enables pathwise sampling from it, which facilitates Monte Carlo methods for evaluating nonlinear functionals.</description>

      <title>Power-of-Two Quantization-Aware-Training (PoT-QAT) in Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, e.g., from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT-2 to 175 billion in GPT-3 to possibly more than trillion in higher versions. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Design for Movable Antenna-Enabled Multiuser MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), which can be swiftly repositioned within a defined region, offer a promising solution to the limitations of fixed-position antennas (FPAs) in adapting to spatial variations in wireless channels, thereby improving channel conditions and communication between transceivers. However, frequent MA position adjustments based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) incur high operational complexity, making real-time CSI acquisition impractical, especially in fast-fading channels. To address these challenges, we propose a two-timescale transmission framework for MA-enabled multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In the large timescale, statistical CSI is exploited to optimize MA positions for long-term ergodic performance, whereas, in the small timescale, beamforming vectors are designed using instantaneous CSI to handle short-term channel fluctuations. Within this new framework, we analyze the ergodic sum rate and develop efficient MA position optimization algorithms for both maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. These algorithms employ alternating optimization (AO), successive convex approximation (SCA), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques, iteratively optimizing antenna positions and refining surrogate functions that approximate the ergodic sum rate. Numerical results show significant ergodic sum rate gains with the proposed two-timescale MA design over conventional FPA systems, particularly under moderate to strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. Notably, MA with ZF beamforming consistently outperforms MA with MRT, highlighting the synergy between beamforming and MAs for superior interference management in environments with moderate Rician factors and high user density, while MA with MRT can offer a simplified alternative to complex beamforming designs in strong LoS conditions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian uncertainty-aware deep learning with noisy labels: Tackling annotation ambiguity in EEG seizure detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is advancing EEG processing for automated epileptic seizure detection and onset zone localization, yet its performance relies heavily on high-quality annotated training data. However, scalp EEG is susceptible to high noise levels, which in turn leads to imprecise annotations of the seizure timing and characteristics. This "label noise" presents a significant challenge in model training and generalization. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian UncertaiNty-aware Deep Learning (BUNDL), a novel algorithm that informs a deep learning model of label ambiguities, thereby enhancing the robustness of seizure detection systems. By integrating domain knowledge into an underlying Bayesian framework, we derive a novel KL-divergence-based loss function that capitalizes on uncertainty to better learn seizure characteristics from scalp EEG. Thus, BUNDL offers a straightforward and model-agnostic method for training deep neural networks with noisy training labels that does not add any parameters to existing architectures. Additionally, we explore the impact of improved detection system on the task of automated onset zone localization. We validate BUNDL using a comprehensive simulated EEG dataset and two publicly available datasets collected by Temple University Hospital (TUH) and Boston Children's Hospital (CHB-MIT). Results show that BUNDL consistently identifies noisy labels and improves the robustness of three base models under various label noise conditions. We also evaluate cross-site generalizability and quantify computational cost of all methods. Ultimately, BUNDL presents as a reliable method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing deep models used in clinical practice, enabling the training of trustworthy models for epilepsy evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology to seamlessly charge low-power devices, but its low end-to-end power transfer efficiency remains a critical challenge. To address the latter, low-cost transmit/radiating architectures, e.g., based on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have shown great potential. Beyond diagonal (BD) RIS is a novel branch of RIS offering enhanced performance over traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) in wireless communications, but its potential gains in RF-WPT remain unexplored. Motivated by this, we analyze a BD-RIS-assisted single-antenna RF-WPT system to charge a single rectifier, and formulate a joint beamforming and multi-carrier waveform optimization problem aiming to maximize the harvested power. We propose two solutions relying on semi-definite programming for fully connected BD-RIS, a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based beamforming approach, and an efficient low-complexity iterative method relying on SCA. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms converge and that adding transmit sub-carriers or RIS elements improves the harvesting performance. We show that the transmit power budget impacts the relative power allocation among different sub-carriers depending on the rectifier's operating regime, while BD-RIS shapes the cascade channel differently for frequency-selective and flat scenarios. Finally, we verify by simulation that BD-RIS and D-RIS achieve the same performance under pure far-field line-of-sight conditions (in the absence of mutual coupling). Meanwhile, BD-RIS outperforms D-RIS as the non-line-of-sight components of the channel become dominant.</description>

      <title>Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk architecture, residual neural dimension reductor (RNDR), that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with increased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial aims to provide signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) practitioners with vital tools, in an accessible way, to answer the question: How to deal with missing data? There are many strategies to handle incomplete signals. In this paper, we propose to group these strategies based on three common analytical tasks: i) missing-data imputation, ii) estimation with missing values and iii) prediction with missing values. We focus on methodological and experimental results through specific case studies on real-world applications. Promising and future research directions are also discussed. We hope that the proposed conceptual framework and the presentation of recent missing-data problems related will encourage researchers of the SP and ML communities to develop original methods and to efficiently deal with new applications involving missing data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) enable active antenna repositioning and passive phase-shift tuning for channel reconfiguration, respectively. Integrating MAs and IRSs boosts spatial degrees of freedom, significantly enhancing wireless network capacity, coverage, and reliability. In this article, we first present the fundamentals of MA-IRS integration, involving clarifying the key design issues, revealing performance gain, and identifying the conditions where MA-IRS synergy persists. Then, we examine practical challenges and propose pragmatic design solutions, including optimization schemes, hardware architectures, deployment strategies, and robust designs for hardware impairments and mobility management. In addition, we highlight how MA-IRS architectures uniquely support advanced integrated sensing and communication, enhancing sensing performance and dual-functional flexibility. Overall, MA-IRS integration emerges as a compelling approach toward next-generation reconfigurable wireless systems.</description>

      <title>The ECME Algorithm Using Factor Analysis for DOA Estimation in Nonuniform Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factor analysis (FA) plays a critical role in psychometrics, econometrics, and statistics. Recently, maximum likelihood FA (MLFA) has been applied to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and a variety of iterative approaches have been developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this article, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed again for MLFA by introducing new complete data, which can thus use two explicit formulas to sequentially update the estimates of parameters at each iteration and have excellent convergence properties. Theoretical analysis shows that the ECME algorithm has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and the convergence to the global optimum is easier. Importantly, MLFA is not the best choice for the subspace based DOA estimation in unknown nonuniform noise.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Joint RIS Phase Shift Compression and WMMSE Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model-based deep learning (DL) architecture is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user communications to reduce the overhead of transmitting phase shift information from the access point (AP) to the RIS controller. The phase shifts are computed at the AP, which has access to the channel state information, and then encoded into a compressed binary control message that is sent to the RIS controller for element configuration. To help reduce beamformer mismatches due to phase shift compression errors, the beamformer is updated using weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) based on the effective channel resulting from the actual (decompressed) RIS reflection coefficients. By unrolling the iterative WMMSE algorithm as part of the wireless communication informed DL architecture, joint phase shift compression and WMMSE beamforming can be trained end-to-end. Simulations show that accounting for phase shift compression errors during beamforming significantly improves the sum-rate performance, even when the number of control bits is lower than the number of RIS elements.</description>

      <title>Confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection for ballistocardiogram using template matching and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heartbeat interval can be detected from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals in a non-contact manner. Conventional methods achieved heartbeat detection from different perspectives, where template matching (TM) and deep learning (DL) were based on the similarity of neighboring heartbeat episodes and robust spatio-temporal characteristics, respectively, and thus, performed varied from case to case. Inspired by the above facts, we propose confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection using both TM and DL, and further explore the advantages of both methods in various scenarios. To be specific, the confidence of the heartbeat detection results was evaluated by the consistency of signal morphology and the variability of the detected heartbeat intervals, which could be formulated by the averaged correlation between each heartbeat episode and the detected template and the normalized standard deviation among detected heartbeat intervals, respectively, where the results with higher confidence were remained. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, we conducted experiments using practical clinical BCG dataset with 34 subjects including 924,235 heartbeats. Numerical results showed that the proposed hybrid method achieved an average absolute interval error of 20.73 ms, yielding a reduction of 29.28 ms and 10.13 ms compared to solo TM and DL methods, respectively. Besides, case study showed the robustness of heartbeat detection of TM and DL to individual differences and signal quality, respectively, and in turn, validated that the hybrid method could benefit from the complementary advantages of both methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid method in practical BCG monitoring scenarios.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication With Homomorphic Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom), which aims to achieve efficient and reliable transmission of meaning between agents, has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, existing encryption schemes encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. To address this issue, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption (HE) to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we overview HE techniques and employ scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to demonstrate that the extractable semantic information can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we further propose the HE-joint source-channel coding (HE-JSCC) scheme, where the traditional JSCC model architecture is modified to support HE operations. Moreover, we present the simulation results for image classification and image generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Framework for Modeling Implantable Antennas in Multilayered Spherical Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and computationally efficient framework for modeling antennas embedded in spherically stratified media, applicable to implantable biomedical antennas and radome-enclosed systems. The method separates the characterization of the radiator from that of the surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs). This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary changes of the spherical medium without re-simulating the antenna, yielding orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional DGF-based MoM approaches. The SSO formulation accommodates multilayer, radially inhomogeneous, and radially uniaxial anisotropic profiles, and the GSM can be obtained from diverse numerical solvers or far-field data, supporting array-level synthesis and measurement-driven modeling. Extensive examples confirm excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, demonstrating the accuracy, generality, and practical versatility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A 240 Elements Matrix Probe with Aberration Mask for 4D Carotid Artery Computational Ultrasound Imaging</title>

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement. Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$ large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.</description>

      <title>PIKAN: Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Explainable UAV Channel Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for health indicator extraction from guided waves in aerospace composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>A Universal and Robust Framework for Multiple Gas Recognition Based-on Spherical Normalization-Coupled Mahalanobis Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face two interconnected challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shift caused by signal drift and decision boundary failure induced by unknown gas interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or conventional classifiers, failing to account for anisotropic feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes the Spherical Normalization coupled Mahalanobis (SNM) module, a universal post-processing module for open-set gas recognition. First, it achieves geometric decoupling through cascaded batch and L2 normalization, projecting features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Second, it utilizes Mahalanobis distance to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries that conform to the anisotropic feature geometry. The architecture-agnostic SNM-Module seamlessly integrates with mainstream backbones including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer. Experiments on the public Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration achieves near-theoretical-limit performance in discriminating among multiple target gases, with an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% at 5% false positive rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction compared to Class Anchor Clustering (CAC). The module maintains exceptional robustness across five sensor positions, with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively addresses the critical challenge of simultaneously achieving high accuracy and high stability in open-set gas recognition, providing solid support for industrial E-nose deployment.</description>
