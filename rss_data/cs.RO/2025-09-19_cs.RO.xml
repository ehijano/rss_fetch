      <title>AEGIS: Automated Error Generation and Identification for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

      <title>FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

      <title>Multi-Quadruped Cooperative Object Transport: Learning Decentralized Pinch-Lift-Move</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.</description>

      <title>LeVR: A Modular VR Teleoperation Framework for Imitation Learning in Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to accelerate IL research for the robotics community.</description>

      <title>DreamControl: Human-Inspired Whole-Body Humanoid Control for Scene Interaction via Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.</description>

      <title>CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation, and other autonomy settings.</description>

      <title>GestOS: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models to control Any Type of Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program (QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats, where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic, requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including space robotics and satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Swarm Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real, human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL) toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV) navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.</description>

      <title>Learning Discrete Abstractions for Visual Rearrangement Tasks Using Vision-Guided Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics. Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics, abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems, integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and outperform existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Object Recognition and Force Estimation with the GelSight Baby Fin Ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure. Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures. Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet, and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better understand and interact with the environments.</description>

      <title>Event-LAB: Towards Standardized Evaluation of Neuromorphic Localization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.</description>

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter. Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical application in occluded strawberry picking.</description>

      <title>Dual-Arm Hierarchical Planning for Laboratory Automation: Vibratory Sieve Shaker Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1) dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization. The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying, imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to 80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment, validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.</description>

      <title>SimCoachCorpus: A naturalistic dataset with language and trajectories for embodied teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\ includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper.

      <title>Hierarchical Planning and Scheduling for Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Disassembly Systems under Structural Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules, sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools, together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable robotic disassembly.</description>

      <title>Toward Embodiment Equivariant Vision-Language-Action Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks, environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments.

      <title>BEV-ODOM2: Enhanced BEV-based Monocular Visual Odometry with PV-BEV Fusion and Dense Flow Supervision for Ground Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace, facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT, Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Efficient 3D Perception on Embedded Systems via Interpolation-Free Tri-Plane Lifting and Volume Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of the approach for embedded robotic perception.</description>

      <title>RealMirror: A Comprehensive, Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Platform for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

      <title>exUMI: Extensible Robot Teaching System with Action-aware Task-agnostic Tactile Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection and representation due to data scarcity and sparsity, and the absence of force feedback in existing systems. To address these limitations, we introduce a tactile robot learning system with both hardware and algorithm innovations. We present exUMI, an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla UMI with robust proprioception (via AR MoCap and rotary encoder), modular visuo-tactile sensing, and automated calibration, achieving 100% data usability. Building on an efficient collection of over 1 M tactile frames, we propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact dynamics and mitigating tactile sparsity. Real-world experiments show that TPP outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap between human tactile intuition and robot learning through co-designed hardware and algorithms, offering open-source resources to advance contact-rich manipulation research.

      <title>Wohlhart's Three-Loop Mechanism: An Overconstrained and Shaky Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK 2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom (DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reference Trajectories in Agile Drone Racing: A Unified Reference-Free Model-Based Controller via MPPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference, whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping, directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver. Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

      <title>Investigating the Effect of LED Signals and Emotional Displays in Human-Robot Shared Workspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task performance in shared workspaces is limited.</description>

      <title>Designing Latent Safety Filters using Pre-Trained Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>COMPASS: Confined-space Manipulation Planning with Active Sensing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces. Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation. Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

      <title>CollabVLA: Self-Reflective Vision-Language-Action Model Dreaming Together with Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates, improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating with humans.</description>

      <title>PERAL: Perception-Aware Motion Control for Passive LiDAR Excitation in Spherical Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360 capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments. Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our code, datasets, weights, and videos are available at: https://robotcontrolstack.github.io/</description>

      <title>CAD-Driven Co-Design for Flight-Ready Jet-Powered Humanoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g., angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing feasible aerial humanoid designs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Task-Driven Diffusion-Based Policy with Affordance Learning for Generalizable Manipulation of Articulated Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness.

      <title>Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.</description>

      <title>Human Interaction for Collaborative Semantic SLAM using Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries, as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts (e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy, map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for future extensions.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Movement Strategies for Texture Discrimination with a Neuromorphic Tactile Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding. We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds. Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\% with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing robotic environmental interaction.</description>

      <title>Affordance-Based Disambiguation of Surgical Instructions for Collaborative Robot-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the operating room.</description>

      <title>PA-MPPI: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Quadrotor Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles, quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI (PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded, PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly reachable.</description>

      <title>M4Diffuser: Multi-View Diffusion Policy with Manipulability-Aware Control for Robust Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable, struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.</description>

      <title>The Role of Touch: Towards Optimal Tactile Sensing Distribution in Anthropomorphic Hands for Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems, must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning control policies and investigate the relationship between object characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>ExT: Towards Scalable Autonomous Excavation via Large-Scale Multi-Task Pretraining and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.</description>

      <title>Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry Fusion for Robust Localization in Large-Scale Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift. Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter (iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575 hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments, highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Robot Coordination and Cooperation with Task Precedence Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task plans while leveraging task relationships.</description>

      <title>Ask-to-Clarify: Resolving Instruction Ambiguity through Multi-turn Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Energy-Constrained Navigation for Planetary Rovers under Hybrid RTG-Solar Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational, rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth, dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within 0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.</description>

      <title>AnoF-Diff: One-Step Diffusion-Based Anomaly Detection for Forceful Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</description>

      <title>Parallel Simulation of Contact and Actuation for Soft Growing Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Multi-Model Parametric Representation of Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method. Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency. Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.</description>

      <title>RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D Geometric Keypoint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at: https://github.com/longkukuhi/RoboEye.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cooperative Salvo Guidance with Seeker-Limited Interceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a cooperative guidance strategy for the simultaneous interception of a constant-velocity, non-maneuvering target, addressing the realistic scenario where only a subset of interceptors are equipped with onboard seekers. To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target observability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling seeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from seeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication topology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go via linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages deviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a target. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to establish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Embodied Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill acquisition in robotics.

      <title>RynnVLA-001: Using Human Demonstrations to Improve Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Sight Trajectories: Tracking, Fusion, and Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

      <title>Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>AdapJ: An Adaptive Extended Jacobian Controller for Soft Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions present challenges for control. To solve these issues, the Jacobian controller has been applied to approximate the nonlinear behaviors in a linear format. Accurate controllers like neural networks can handle delayed and nonlinear motions, but they require large datasets and exhibit low adaptability. Based on a novel analysis on these controllers, we propose an adaptive extended Jacobian controller, AdapJ, for soft manipulators. This controller retains the concise format of the Jacobian controller but introduces independent parameters. Similar to neural networks, its initialization and updating mechanism leverages the inverse model without building the corresponding forward model. In the experiments, we first compare the performance of the Jacobian controller, model predictive controller, neural network controller, iterative feedback controller, and AdapJ in simulation. We further analyze how AdapJ parameters adapt in response to the physical property change. Then, real-world experiments have validated that AdapJ outperforms the neural network controller, model predictive controller, and iterative feedback controller with fewer training samples and adapts robustly to varying conditions, including different control frequencies, material softness, and external disturbances. Future work may include online adjustment of the controller format and adaptability validation in more scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Many robotic tasks require grasping objects at specific object parts instead of arbitrarily, a crucial capability for interactions beyond simple pick-and-place, such as human-robot interaction, handovers, or tool use. Prior work has focused either on generic grasp prediction or task-conditioned grasping, but not on directly targeting object parts in an open-vocabulary way. We propose AnyPart, a modular framework that unifies open-vocabulary object detection, part segmentation, and 6-DoF grasp prediction to enable robots to grasp user-specified parts of arbitrary objects based on natural language prompts. We evaluate 16 model combinations, and demonstrate that the best-performing combination achieves 60.8% grasp success in cluttered real-world scenes at 60 times faster inference than existing approaches. To support this study, we introduce a new dataset for part-based grasping and conduct a detailed failure analysis. Our core insight is that modularly combining existing foundation models unlocks surprisingly strong and efficient capabilities for open-vocabulary part-based grasping without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>ReMoBot: Retrieval-Based Few-Shot Imitation Learning for Mobile Manipulation with Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) algorithms typically distill experience into parametric behavior policies to mimic expert demonstrations. However, with limited demonstrations, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate actions, particularly under partial observability. To address this problem, we introduce a few-shot IL approach, ReMoBot, which directly retrieves information from demonstrations to solve Mobile manipulation tasks with ego-centric visual observations. Given the current observation, ReMoBot utilizes vision foundation models to identify relevant demonstrations, considering visual similarity w.r.t. both individual observations and history trajectories. A motion selection policy then selects the proper command for the robot until the task is successfully completed.
  The performance of ReMoBot is evaluated on three mobile manipulation tasks with a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in both simulation and the real world. After benchmarking five approaches in simulation, we compare our method with two baselines in the real world, training directly on the real-world dataset without sim-to-real transfer. With only 20 demonstrations, ReMoBot outperforms the baselines, achieving high success rates in Table Uncover (70%) and Gap Cover (80%), while also showing promising performance on the more challenging Curtain Open task in the real-world setting. Furthermore, ReMoBot demonstrates generalization across varying robot positions, object sizes, and material types.

      <title>CushionCatch: A Compliant Catching Mechanism for Mobile Manipulators via Combined Optimization and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catching flying objects with a cushioning process is a skill commonly performed by humans, yet it remains a significant challenge for robots. In this paper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to achieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a high-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the optimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC) planner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as possible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that leverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and positional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to effectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following this, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by the P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences between humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both simulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of 98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in impact torques. The open source code has be released for the reference of the community.</description>

      <title>Handle Object Navigation as Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) requires agents to navigate to objects specified via open-ended natural language without predefined categories or prior environmental knowledge. While recent methods leverage foundation models or multi-modal maps, they often rely on 2D representations and greedy strategies or require additional training or modules with high computation load, limiting performance in complex environments and real applications. We propose WTRP-Searcher, a novel framework that formulates ZSON as a Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem (WTRP), minimizing the weighted waiting time of viewpoints. Using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), we score viewpoints based on object-description similarity, projected onto a 2D map with depth information. An open-vocabulary detector identifies targets, dynamically updating goals, while a 3D embedding feature map enhances spatial awareness and environmental recall. WTRP-Searcher outperforms existing methods, offering efficient global planning and improved performance in complex ZSON tasks. Code and design will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>R900: Understanding the Cost-Effectiveness of Random Exploration from 900 Hours of Robotic Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data scarcity presents a key bottleneck for imitation learning in robotic manipulation. In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-actions and video sequences produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-to investigate their potential as a cost-effective data source. Our investigation follows two paradigms: (a) random actions, where we assess their feasibility for autonomously bootstrapping data collection policies, and (b) random exploration video frames, where we evaluate their effectiveness in pre-training parameter-dense networks with self-supervised learning objectives. To minimize human supervision, we first develop a fully automated pipeline that handles episode labeling, termination, and resetting using cloud-based microservices for real-time monitoring. Building on this, we present a large-scale study on the cost-effectiveness of real-world random exploration in a non-trivial two-layer stacking task, drawing on statistical results from 807 hours of random actions, 71 hours of random exploration video (1.28M frames), and 1,260 times of policy evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available and access to the robot environment with the automated pipeline is to be made accessible via cloud service for future research.</description>

      <title>ForceVLA: Enhancing VLA Models with a Force-aware MoE for Contact-rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control. Code and data will be released at https://sites.google.com/view/forcevla2025.</description>

      <title>Semantic Exploration and Dense Mapping of Complex Environments using Ground Robot with Panoramic LiDAR-Camera Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>ActivePusher: Active Learning and Planning with Residual Physics for Nonprehensile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward versatile real-world manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to obtain. However, collecting training data for learning-based methods can be costly and inefficient, as it often relies on randomly sampled interactions that are not necessarily the most informative. Furthermore, learned models tend to exhibit high uncertainty in underexplored regions of the skill space, undermining the reliability of long-horizon planning. To address these challenges, we propose ActivePusher, a novel framework that combines residual-physics modeling with uncertainty-based active learning, to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters. Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic planners, leveraging uncertainty estimates to bias control sampling toward more reliable actions. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and real-world environments, and demonstrate that it consistently improves data efficiency and achieves higher planning success rates in comparison to baseline methods.

      <title>Robotic System for Chemical Experiment Automation with Dual Demonstration of End-effector and Jig Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, designing synchronized motions between the robot and experimental jigs remains challenging, especially for flexible experimental automation. This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands. Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories. To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, providing a practical framework for intuitive and adaptable robotic laboratory automation.

      <title>GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>UniTracker: Learning Universal Whole-Body Motion Tracker for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving expressive and generalizable whole-body motion control is essential for deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation, demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial pursuer observability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for novel lighting generation on existing real-world human demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting sources. To improve efficiency and maintain consistency across each generated sequence, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the visual quality of the generated sequences, assessing its effectiveness in improving the imitation learning policy performance (38.75\%) under six unseen real-world lighting conditions, and conduct ablation studies on individual modules of the proposed framework. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework: background generation, object texture generation and distractor positioning. The code for the framework will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MolmoAct: Action Reasoning Models that can Reason in Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability, generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models (ARMs), a class of robotic foundation models that integrate perception, planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model, MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1.5; 86.6% average success on LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks; and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional 22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset -- a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model. We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

      <title>T-araVLN: Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

      <title>Prespecified-Performance Kinematic Tracking Control for Aerial Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10065</link>

Abstract: This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second, quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the preset time.</description>

      <title>The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Conservative Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00908</link>

Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms for such filters, however, suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we add to this set of approaches an algorithm for training neural control barrier functions from offline datasets. Such functions can be used to design constraints for quadratic programs that are then used as safety filters. Our algorithm trains these functions so that the system is not only prevented from reaching unsafe states but is also disincentivized from reaching out-of-distribution ones, at which they would be less reliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety while minimally affecting task performance.

      <title>ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</description>
