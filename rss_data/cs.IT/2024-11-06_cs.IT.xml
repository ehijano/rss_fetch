      <title>Super-resolution generalized eigenvalue method with truly sub-Nyquist sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The achievement of spectral super-resolution sensing is critically important for a variety of applications, such as radar, remote sensing, and wireless communication. However, in compressed spectrum sensing, challenges such as spectrum leakage and the picket-fence effect significantly complicate the accurate extraction of super-resolution signal components. Additionally, the practical implementation of random sampling poses a significant hurdle to the widespread adoption of compressed spectrum sensing techniques. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a generalized eigenvalue method that leverages the incoherence between signal components and the linearity-preserving characteristics of differential operations. This method facilitates the precise extraction of signal component parameters with super-resolution capabilities under sub-Nyquist sampling conditions. The proposed technique is founded on uniform sub-Nyquist sampling, which represents a true sub-Nyquist approach and effectively mitigates the complexities associated with hardware implementation. Furthermore, the proposed method diverges from traditional compressed sensing techniques by operating outside the discrete Fourier transform framework. This departure successfully eliminates spectral leakage and the picket-fence effect. Moreover, it substantially reduces the detrimental impacts of random sampling on signal reconstruction and hardware implementation, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness and feasibility of spectral super-resolution sensing.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Cyclic Codes with Square-Root-Like Lower Bounds on Their Minimum Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary self-dual cyclic codes have been studied since the classical work of Sloane and Thompson published in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 29, 1983. Twenty five years later, an infinite family of binary self-dual cyclic codes with lengths $n_i$ and minimum distances $d_i \geq \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{n_i+2}$ was presented in a paper of IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 55, 2009. However, no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual binary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have the square-root lower bound and no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual nonbinary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have a lower bound better than the square-root lower bound are known in the literature. In this paper, an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\bf F}_{2^s}$ with a square-root-like lower bound is constructed. An infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual binary cyclic codes with the square-root lower bound. Another infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\bf F}_{2^s}$ with a lower bound better than the square-root bound for $s \geq 2$. Consequently, two breakthroughs in coding theory are made in this paper. An infinite family of self-dual binary cyclic codes with a square-root-like lower bound is also presented in this paper. An infinite family of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\bf F}_{2^{2s}}$ with a square-root-like lower bound and an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual linear codes over ${\bf F}_{q}$ with $q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ with a square-root-like lower bound are also constructed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Codes with restricted overlaps: expandability, constructions, and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a $q$-ary block code satisfying the property that no $l$-letters long codeword's prefix occurs as a suffix of any codeword for $l$ inside some interval. We determine a general upper bound on the maximum size of these codes and a tighter bound for codes where overlaps with lengths not exceeding $k$ are prohibited. We then provide constructions for codes with various restrictions on overlap lengths and use them to determine lower bounds on the maximum sizes. In particular, we construct $(1,k)$-overlap-free codes where $k \geq n/2$ and $n$ denotes the block size, expand a known construction of $(k,n-1)$-overlap-free codes, and combine the ideas behind both constructions to obtain $(t_1,t_2)$-overlap-free codes and codes that are simultaneously $(1,k)$- and $(n-k,n-1)$-overlap-free for some $k &lt; n/2$. In the case when overlaps of lengths between 1 and $k$ are prohibited, we complete the characterisation of non-expandable codes started by Cai, Wang, and Feng (2023).</description>

      <title>Distributed Graph Neural Network Design for Sum Ergodic Spectral Efficiency Maximization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed learning-based framework to tackle the sum ergodic rate maximization problem in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by utilizing the graph neural network (GNN). Different from centralized schemes, which gather all the channel state information (CSI) at the central processing unit (CPU) for calculating the resource allocation, the local resource of access points (APs) is exploited in the proposed distributed GNN-based framework to allocate transmit powers. Specifically, APs can use a unique GNN model to allocate their power based on the local CSI. The GNN model is trained at the CPU using the local CSI of one AP, with partially exchanged information from other APs to calculate the loss function to reflect system characteristics, capturing comprehensive network information while avoiding computation burden. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed learning-based approach achieves a sum ergodic rate close to that of centralized learning while outperforming the model-based optimization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent trade-off in on-line learning is between exploration and exploitation. A good balance between these two (conflicting) goals can achieve a better long-term performance. Can we define an optimal balance? We propose to study this question through a backward-adaptive lossy compression system, which exhibits a "natural" trade-off between exploration and exploitation.</description>

      <title>User Centric Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current studies on semantic communications mainly focus on efficiently extracting semantic information to reduce bandwidth usage between a transmitter and a user. Although significant process has been made in the semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter side along, without considering the user's actual requirements. As a result, critical information that is of primary concern to the user may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the user, as all received information is irrelevant to the user's interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a user centric semantic communication system, where the user sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter can understand the user's requests for semantic information and extract the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We solve this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed user centric semantic communication system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fraunhofer and Fresnel Boundaries for Phased Array Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the characterization of near-field propagation regions for phased array antennas, with a particular focus on the propagation boundaries defined by Fraunhofer and Fresnel distances. These distances, which serve as critical boundaries for understanding signal propagation behavior, have been extensively studied and characterized in the literature for single-element antennas. However, the direct application of these results to phased arrays, a common practice in the field, is argued to be invalid and non-exact. This work calls for a deeper understanding of near-field propagation to accurately characterize such boundaries around phased array antennas. More specifically, for a single-element antenna, the Fraunhofer distance is $d^{\mathrm{F}}=2D^2 \sin^2(\theta)/\lambda$ where $D$ represents the largest dimension of the antenna, $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\theta$ denotes the observation angle. We show that for phased arrays, $d^{\mathrm{F}}$ experiences a fourfold increase (i.e., $d^{\mathrm{F}}=8D^2 \sin^2(\theta)/\lambda$) provided that $|\theta-\frac{\pi}{2}|&gt;\theta^F$ (which holds for most practical scenarios), where $\theta^F$ is a small angle whose value depends on the number of array elements, and for the case $|\theta-\frac{\pi}{2}|\leq\theta^F$, we have $d^{\mathrm{F}}\in[2D^2/\lambda,8D^2\cos^2(\theta^F)/\lambda]$, where the precise value is obtained according to some square polynomial function $\widetilde{F}(\theta)$. Besides, we also prove that the Fresnel distance for phased array antennas is given by $d^{\mathrm{N}}=1.75 \sqrt{{D^3}/{\lambda}}$ which is $\sqrt{8}$ times greater than the corresponding distance for a conventional single-element antenna with the same dimension.</description>

      <title>A Study on Characterization of Near-Field Sub-Regions For Phased-Array Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize three near-field sub-regions for phased array antennas by elaborating on the boundaries {\it Fraunhofer}, {\it radial-focal}, and {\it non-radiating} distances. The {\it Fraunhofer distance} which is the boundary between near and far field has been well studied in the literature on the principal axis (PA) of single-element center-fed antennas, where PA denotes the axis perpendicular to the antenna surface passing from the antenna center. The results are also valid for phased arrays if the PA coincides with the boresight, which is not commonly the case in practice. In this work, we completely characterize the Fraunhofer distance by considering various angles between the PA and the boresight. For the {\it radial-focal distance}, below which beamfocusing is feasible in the radial domain, a formal characterization of the corresponding region based on the general model of near-field channels (GNC) is missing in the literature. We investigate this and elaborate that the maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) beamforming based on the simple uniform spherical wave (USW) channel model results in a radial gap between the achieved and the desired focal points. While the gap vanishes when the array size $N$ becomes sufficiently large, we propose a practical algorithm to remove this gap in the non-asymptotic case when $N$ is not very large. Finally, the {\it non-radiating} distance, below which the reactive power dominates active power, has been studied in the literature for single-element antennas. We analytically explore this for phased arrays and show how different excitation phases of the antenna array impact it. We also clarify some misconceptions about the non-radiating and Fresnel distances prevailing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Phase Group Category of Bimodule Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum channel on a von Neuamnn algebras $\mathcal{M}$ preserving a von Neumann subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$, namely $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodule unital completely positive map. By introducing the relative irreducibility of a bimodule quantum channel, we show that its eigenvalues with modulus 1 form a finite cyclic group, called its phase group. Moreover, the corresponding eigenspaces are invertible $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodules, which encode a categorification of the phase group. When $\mathcal{N}\subset \mathcal{M}$ is a finite-index irreducible subfactor of type II$_1$, we prove that any bimodule quantum channel is relative irreducible for the intermediate subfactor of its fixed points. In addition, we can reformulate and prove these results intrinsically in subfactor planar algebras without referring to the subfactor using the methods of quantum Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Conditional Vendi Score: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Diversity Evaluation of Prompt-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-conditioned generation models are commonly evaluated based on the quality of the generated data and its alignment with the input text prompt. On the other hand, several applications of prompt-based generative models require sufficient diversity in the generated data to ensure the models' capability of generating image and video samples possessing a variety of features. However, most existing diversity metrics are designed for unconditional generative models, and thus cannot distinguish the diversity arising from variations in text prompts and that contributed by the generative model itself. In this work, our goal is to quantify the prompt-induced and model-induced diversity in samples generated by prompt-based models. We propose an information-theoretic approach for internal diversity quantification, where we decompose the kernel-based entropy $H(X)$ of the generated data $X$ into the sum of the conditional entropy $H(X|T)$, given text variable $T$, and the mutual information $I(X; T)$ between the text and data variables. We introduce the \emph{Conditional-Vendi} score based on $H(X|T)$ to quantify the internal diversity of the model and the \emph{Information-Vendi} score based on $I(X; T)$ to measure the statistical relevance between the generated data and text prompts. We provide theoretical results to statistically interpret these scores and relate them to the unconditional Vendi score. We conduct several numerical experiments to show the correlation between the Conditional-Vendi score and the internal diversity of text-conditioned generative models. The codebase is available at \href{https://github.com/mjalali/conditional-vendi}{https://github.com/mjalali/conditional-vendi}.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communications With Low Resolution DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize spectrum and thereby save cost and power. At the higher end of the spectrum, ISAC systems operate at wideband using large antenna arrays to meet the stringent demands for high-resolution sensing and enhanced communications capacity. On the other hand, the overall design should satisfy energy-efficiency and hardware constraints such as operating on low resolution components for a practical scenario. Therefore, this paper presents the design of Hybrid ANalog and Digital BeAmformers with Low resoLution (HANDBALL) digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We introduce a greedy-search-based approach to design the analog beamformers for multi-user multi-target ISAC scenario. Then, the quantization distortion is taken into account in order to design the baseband beamformer with low resolution DACs. We evaluated performance of the proposed HANDBALL technique in terms of both spectral efficiency and sensing beampattern, providing a satisfactory sensing and communication performance for both one-bit and few-bit designs.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression: A Distribution-Free Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions on the training data, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of diffeomorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Frames for signal processing on Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral decomposition of graph adjacency matrices is an essential ingredient in the design of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques. When the adjacency matrix has multi-dimensional eigenspaces, it is desirable to base GSP constructions on a particular eigenbasis that better reflects the graph's symmetries. In this paper, we provide an explicit and detailed representation-theoretic account for the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a weighted Cayley graph. Our method applies to all weighted Cayley graphs, regardless of whether they are quasi-Abelian, and offers detailed descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors derived from the coefficient functions of the representations of the underlying group. Next, we turn our attention to constructing frames on Cayley graphs. Frames are overcomplete spanning sets that ensure stable and potentially redundant systems for signal reconstruction. We use our proposed eigenbases to build frames that are suitable for developing signal processing on Cayley graphs. These are the Frobenius--Schur frames and Cayley frames, for which we provide a characterization and a practical recipe for their construction.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Improved Explicit Near-Optimal Codes in the High-Noise Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study uniquely decodable codes and list decodable codes in the high-noise regime, specifically codes that are uniquely decodable from $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ fraction of errors and list decodable from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We present several improved explicit constructions that achieve near-optimal rates, as well as efficient or even linear-time decoding algorithms. Our contributions are as follows.
  1. Explicit Near-Optimal Linear Time Uniquely Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of correcting $e$ errors and $s$ erasures whenever $2e + s &lt; (1 - \varepsilon)n$ in linear-time.
  2. Explicit Near-Optimal List Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with a list size $L = \exp\exp\exp(\log^{\ast}n)$ in polynomial time.
  3. List Decodable Code with Near-Optimal List Size: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with an optimal list size of $O(1/\varepsilon)$, albeit with a suboptimal rate of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors in polynomial time. Furthermore, we introduce a new combinatorial object called multi-set disperser, and use it to give a family of list decodable codes with near-optimal rate $\frac{\varepsilon}{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}$ and list size $\frac{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}$, that can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time and decoded in deterministic polynomial time.
  We also introduce new decoding algorithms that may prove valuable for other graph-based codes.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-stage intelligent scheduler is proposed to minimize the packet-level delay jitter while guaranteeing delay bound. Firstly, Lyapunov technology is employed to transform the delay-violation constraint into a sequential slot-level queue stability problem. Secondly, a hierarchical scheme is proposed to solve the resource allocation between multiple base stations and users, where the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) gives the user priority and the number of scheduled packets, while the underlying scheduler allocates the resource. Our proposed scheme achieves lower delay jitter and delay violation rate than the Round-Robin Earliest Deadline First algorithm and MARL with delay violation penalty.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AoI at Query in Multiuser Wireless Uplink Networks: A Whittle Index Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to schedule multiple users to optimize information freshness in a pull-based wireless network, where the status updates from users are requested by randomly arriving queries at the destination. We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the performance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is naturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is prohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index approach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs by relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query arrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions within each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using conventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we show that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type structure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the sub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the steady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different threshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions of different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and scheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient algorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs. The simulation results validate our analyses and show the proposed Whittle index policy outperforms baseline policies and achieves near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretic View of Unlabeled Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is the problem of solving a linear system of equations, where the right-hand-side vector is known only up to a permutation. In this work, we study fields of rational functions related to symmetric polynomials and their images under a linear projection of the variables; as a consequence, we establish that the solution to an n-dimensional unlabeled sensing problem with generic data can be obtained as the unique solution to a system of n + 1 polynomial equations of degrees 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 in n unknowns. Besides the new theoretical insights, this development offers the potential for scaling up algebraic unlabeled sensing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Computable one-way functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>
