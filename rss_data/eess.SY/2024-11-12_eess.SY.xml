      <title>Improved Convolution-Based Analysis for Worst-Case Probability Response Time of CAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controller Area Networks (CANs) are widely adopted in real-time automotive control and are increasingly standard in factory automation. Considering their critical application in safety-critical systems, The error rate of the system must be accurately predicted and guaranteed. Through simulation, it is possible to obtain a low-precision overview of the system's behavior. However, for low-probability events, the required number of samples in simulation increases rapidly, making it difficult to conduct a sufficient number of simulations in practical applications, and the statistical results may deviate from the actual outcomes. Therefore, a formal analysis is needed to evaluate the error rate of the system. This paper improves the worst-case probability response time analysis by using convolution-based busy-window and backlog techniques under the error retransmission protocol of CANs. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed method improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Freeway Traffic Speed Estimation under Oblique Grid using Vehicle Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating spatiotemporal traffic states on freeways is a significant challenge due to limited sensor deployment and potential data corruption. In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Stop-and-Go Traffic Congestion with Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neural operator learning framework for designing boundary control to mitigate stop-and-go congestion on freeways. The freeway traffic dynamics are described by second-order coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework learns feedback boundary control strategies from the closed-loop PDE solution using backstepping controllers, which are widely employed for boundary stabilization of PDE systems. The PDE backstepping control design is time-consuming and requires intensive depth of expertise, since it involves constructing and solving backstepping control kernels. To address these challenges, we present neural operator (NO) learning schemes for the ARZ traffic system that not only ensure closed-loop stability robust to parameter and initial condition variations but also accelerate boundary controller computation. The stability guarantee of the NO-approximated control laws is obtained using Lyapunov analysis. We further propose the physics-informed neural operator (PINO) to reduce the reliance on extensive training data. The performance of the NO schemes is evaluated by simulated and real traffic data, compared with the benchmark backstepping controller, a Proportional Integral (PI) controller, and a PINN-based controller. The NO-approximated methods achieve a computational speedup of approximately 300 times with only a 1% error trade-off compared to the backstepping controller, while outperforming the other two controllers in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The robustness of the NO schemes is validated using real traffic data, and tested across various initial traffic conditions and demand scenarios. The results show that neural operators can significantly expedite and simplify the process of obtaining controllers for traffic PDE systems with great potential application for traffic management.</description>

      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Oscillator Networks Using Physics-Informed Hybrid Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of non-linear oscillator networks remains challenging due to discrepancies between simplified analytical models and real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we investigate hybrid reservoir computing, combining reservoir computing with "expert" analytical models. Simulating the absence of an exact model, we first test the surrogate models with parameter errors in their expert model. Second, we assess their performance when their expert model lacks key non-linear coupling terms present in an extended ground-truth model. We focus on short-term forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes, evaluating the use of these surrogates for control applications. We show that hybrid reservoir computers generally outperform standard reservoir computers and exhibit greater robustness to parameter tuning. Notably, unlike standard reservoir computers, the performance of the hybrid does not degrade when crossing an observed spectral radius threshold. Furthermore, there is good performance for dynamical regimes not accessible to the expert model, demonstrating the contribution of the reservoir.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with a dynamical model to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the DA to utilize only observations within a nearby window, significantly reducing computational storage. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and the adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, its advantage of computational storage is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Tracking Control with Binary-Valued Output Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers real-time control and learning problems for finite-dimensional linear systems under binary-valued and randomly disturbed output observations. This has long been regarded as an open problem because the exact values of the traditional regression vectors used in the construction of adaptive algorithms are unavailable, as one only has binary-valued output information. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the adaptive estimation problem of the corresponding infinite-impulse-response (IIR) dynamical systems, and apply the double array martingale theory that has not been previously used in adaptive control. This enables us to establish global convergence results for both the adaptive prediction regret and the parameter estimation error, without resorting to such stringent data conditions as persistent excitation and bounded system signals that have been used in almost all existing related literature. Based on this, an adaptive control law will be designed that can effectively combine adaptive learning and feedback control. Finally, we are able to show that the closed-loop adaptive control system is optimal in the sense that the long-run average tracking error is minimized almost surely for any given bounded reference signals. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this appears to be the first adaptive control result for general linear systems with general binary sensors and arbitrarily given bounded reference signals.</description>

      <title>Modelling, design and control of middle-size tilt-rotor quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the mathematical modelling and 3D design of a tilt-rotor quadrotor aircraft. The aircraft is a VTOL design and has capacity for one pilot. The design incorporates a part manual part automatic computerised flight control system and hybrid powertrain providing energy to eight ducted contrarotating propellers. Analysis of controllability was performed using the parameters derived from the developed model for the take-off phase of flight. The aircraft is of a lightweight design and is intended to fill a niche in the aviation market with potential for civilian and military applications. The aircraft has multiple redundancies in the instance of propeller failure. The viability of a hybrid powerplant is explored by combining industry standard gas turbine technology with electrical motor and battery systems. The combination of these systems results in a safe, versatile aircraft that can operate at different levels of automation depending on environmental factors or phase of flight. Simulation confirms the design of the aircraft.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Physical Security of Vehicles: Zero Dynamics Attacks Against Vehicle's Lateral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vehicles have evolved from mechanical systems to complex and connected ones controlled by numerous digital computers interconnected through internal networks. While this development has improved their efficiency and safety, it also brings new potential risks, particularly cyber-attacks. Several studies have explored the security of vehicle dynamics against such threats. Among these dynamics, the vehicle's lateral dynamics are crucial for maintaining stability and control during turns and maneuvers, making them a key focus of research. However, only a few recent studies have specifically investigated the security of lateral dynamics. This paper explores the potential for zero dynamics attacks on the vehicle's lateral dynamics, where the attacker can remain undetected by leaving no trace on the system's outputs. Three scenarios are studied: when the output includes yaw rate, lateral acceleration, and their combination. These two critical measurements of a vehicle's lateral motion are accessible through the inertial measurement units (IMU) in every vehicle. For each scenario, the impact of zero dynamics attacks on system performance is analyzed and illustrated through simulations. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for securing vehicles' lateral dynamics against such attacks.</description>

      <title>A capacity renting framework for shared energy storage considering peer-to-peer energy trading of prosumers with privacy protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared energy storage systems (ESS) present a promising solution to the temporal imbalance between energy generation from renewable distributed generators (DGs) and the power demands of prosumers. However, as DG penetration rates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant, necessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the shared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of effective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to increased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting framework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the proposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent capacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the trading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the variational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy protection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of P2P energy trading on the shared ESS framework and validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm.</description>

      <title>Behavior-Aware Efficient Detection of Malicious EVs in V2G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, detecting malicious EV drivers is becoming increasingly important for the reliability and efficiency of smart grids. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML) algorithms are employed to predict user behavior and identify patterns of non-cooperation. However, the ML predictions are often untrusted, which can significantly degrade the performance of existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a safety-enabled group testing scheme, \ouralg, which combines the efficiency of probabilistic group testing with ML predictions and the robustness of combinatorial group testing. We prove that \ouralg is $O(d)$-consistent and $O(d\log n)$-robust, striking a near-optimal trade-off. Experiments on synthetic data and case studies based on \textsc{ACN-Data}, a real-world EV charging dataset validate the efficacy of \ouralg for efficiently detecting malicious users in V2G systems. Our findings contribute to the growing field of algorithms with predictions and provide insights for incorporating distributional ML advice into algorithmic decision-making in energy and transportation-related systems.</description>

      <title>A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor with Improved Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.</description>

      <title>Why has advanced commercial HVAC control not yet achieved its promise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, research and development efforts have shown that advanced control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment in commercial buildings can improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and turn buildings into active participants in the power grid. Despite these efforts, advanced commercial HVAC control has not yet seen widespread adoption. In this paper, we argue that the research community can help companies deploy advanced HVAC control at speed and scale by reorienting research efforts toward clearly demonstrating the business case for adoption. To support this argument, we draw on findings from the 2023 Intelligent Building Operations Workshop, which brought together researchers, entrepreneurs, and representatives from industry and government to discuss current business offerings, state-of-the-art field demonstrations, barriers to adoption, and future directions.</description>

      <title>RRT* Based Optimal Trajectory Generation with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications under Kinodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel RRT*-based strategy for generating kinodynamically feasible paths that satisfy temporal logic specifications. Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Smooth Zone Barrier Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Constrained Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Smooth Zone Barrier Lyapunov Function (s-ZBLF) for output and full-state constrained nonlinear control systems. Unlike traditional BLF methods, where control effort continuously increases as the state moves toward the constraint boundaries, the s-ZBLF method keeps the control effort nearly zero near the origin, with a more aggressive increase as the system approaches the boundary. However, unlike previous works where control effort was zero within a predefined safe region around the origin, the s-ZBLF overcomes the disadvantage of discontinuous control activation by providing a smooth, gradual increase in control effort as the state nears the constraints. This smooth transition improves continuity in the control response and enhances stability by reducing chattering. Additionally, the s-ZBLF provides the advantage of minimal control effort in regions far from the constraints, reducing energy consumption and actuator wear. Two forms of the s-ZBLF, logarithmic-based and rational-based, are presented. Theoretical analysis guarantees that all system states remain within the defined constraints, ensuring boundedness and stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling constrained nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Distributed Estimators for Large-Scale Interconnected Systems: Time-Varying and Time-Invariant Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a distributed estimation problem for time-varying/time-invariant large-scale interconnected systems (LISs). A fully distributed estimator is presented by recursively solving a distributed modified Riccati equation (DMRE) with decoupling variables. By partitioning the LIS based on the transition matrix's block structure, it turns out that the stability of the subsystem is independent of the global LIS if the decoupling variable is selected as the number of out-neighbors. Additionally, it is revealed that any LIS can be equivalently represented by a Markov system. Based on this insight, we show that the stability decoupling above can also be achieved if the decoupling variable equals the number of in-neighbors. Then, the distributed estimator is proved to be stable if the DMRE remains uniformly bounded. When the LIS is considered time-invariant, and by analyzing the spectral radius of a linear operator, it is proved that the DMRE is uniformly bounded if and only if a linear matrix inequality is feasible. Based on the boundedness result, we also show that the distributed estimator converges to a unique steady state for any initial condition. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>One controller to rule them all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine having a system to control and only know that it belongs to a certain class of dynamical systems. Would it not be amazing to simply plug in a controller and have it work as intended? With the rise of in-context learning and powerful architectures like Transformers, this might be possible, and we want to show it. In this work, within the model reference framework, we hence propose the first in-context learning-based approach to design a unique contextual controller for an entire class of dynamical systems rather than focusing on just a single instance. Our promising numerical results show the possible advantages of the proposed paradigm, paving the way for a shift from the "one-system-one-controller" control design paradigm to a new "one-class-one-controller" logic.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Dynamic Mode Decomposition for families of periodic trajectories in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of the Lunar Gateway and Artemis missions has renewed interest in lunar exploration, including both manned and unmanned missions. This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Bus Voltage Restoration for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulating the voltage of the common DC bus, also referred to as the load bus, in DC microgrids is crucial for ensuring reliability and maintaining the nominal load voltage, which is essential for protecting sensitive loads from voltage variations. Stability and reliability are thereby enhanced, preventing malfunctions and extending the lifespan of sensitive loads (e.g., electronic devices). Voltage drops are caused by resistances of feeders connecting converters to the common DC bus, resulting in a reduced DC bus voltage compared to the nominal/desired value. Existing techniques to restore this voltage in DC microgrids are mainly centralized and rely on secondary control layers. These layers sense the common DC bus voltage, compare it to the nominal value, and utilize a PI controller to send corrections via communication links to each converter. In this paper, a local and straightforward approach to restoring the bus voltage in DC microgrids is presented, ensuring regulation in a decentralized manner. Voltage drops across resistances of feeders are compensated by an additional control loop feedback within each converter, based on the converter output current and feeder resistance. The proposed approach is verified through simulation and hardware-in-the-loop results, eliminating the need for communication links and hence increasing reliability and reducing cybersecurity threats.</description>

      <title>ElectricityEmissions.jl: A Framework for the Comparison of Carbon Intensity Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06560v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of individuals, companies and organizations are interested in computing and minimizing the carbon emissions associated with their real-time electricity consumption. To achieve this, they require a carbon signal, i.e. a metric that defines the real-time carbon intensity of their electricity supply. Unfortunately, in a grid with multiple generation sources and multiple consumers, there is no unambiguous way to trace electricity from source to sink. This makes it hard to define an appropriate signal, leading to a raging discussion about how to best quantify the carbon footprint of electricity.
  This paper seeks to inform the discussion about which carbon signal is better or more suitable for two important use cases, namely carbon-informed load shifting and carbon accounting. We do this by developing a new software package ElectricityEmissions$.$jl, that computes several established and newly proposed carbon emission metrics for standard electric grid test cases. We also demonstrate how the package can be used to investigate the effects of using these metrics to guide load shifting. Our results affirm previous research, which showed that the choice of carbon emission metric has significant impact on shifting results and associated carbon emission reductions. In addition, we demonstrate the impact of load shifting on both the consumers that perform the shifting and consumers that do not. Disconcertingly, we observe that shifting according to common metrics such as average carbon emissions can reduce the amount of emissions allocated to data center, but cause an increase in the total emissions of the system.</description>

      <title>DERs-Aided Blackstart and Load Restoration Framework for Distribution Systems Considering Synchronization and Frequency Security Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events have led to long-duration outages in the distribution system (DS), necessitating novel approaches to blackstart and restore the system. Existing blackstart solutions utilize blackstart units to establish multiple microgrids, sequentially energize non-blackstart units, and restore loads. However, these approaches often result in isolated microgrids. In DER-aided blackstart, the continuous operation of these microgrids is uncertain due to the finite energy capacity of commonly used blackstart units, such as battery energy storage (BES)-based grid-forming inverters (GFMIs). To address this issue, this article proposes a holistic blackstart and restoration framework that incorporates synchronization between microgrids and the entire DS with the transmission grid (TG). To support synchronization, we leveraged virtual synchronous generator-based control for GFMIs to estimate their frequency response to load pick-up events using only initial/final quasi-steady-state points. Subsequently, a synchronization switching condition was developed to model synchronizing switches, aligning them seamlessly with a linearized branch flow problem. Finally, we designed a bottom-up blackstart and restoration framework that considers the switching structure of the DS, energizing/synchronizing switches, DERs with grid-following inverters, and BES-based GFMIs with frequency security constraints. The proposed framework is validated in IEEE-123-bus system, considering cases with two and four GFMIs under various TG recovery instants.</description>

      <title>Skipped Adjacency Pulse Width Modulation: Zero Voltage Switching over Full Duty Cycle Range for Hybrid Flying Capacitor Multi-Level Converters without Dynamic Level Changing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06589v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) across the full duty cycle range in hybrid flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) converters, eliminating the need for dynamic level changing and active re-balancing. Utilizing skipped adjacency pulse width modulation (SAPWM), this approach avoids the nearest pole voltage level, thereby increasing volt-seconds within specific duty cycle range. The method uses a modified PWM scheme, which preserves effective pole voltage by changing duty reference and employing digital logic processing. Simulation results verify the proposed method achieving full-range ZVS. This SAPWM technique is compatible with hybrid FCML converters with various levels, offering enhanced efficiency and reduced switching losses.</description>

      <title>An exact active sensing strategy for a class of bio-inspired systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of translation-invariant systems with a specific category of output nonlinearities motivated by biological sensing. We show that no dynamic output feedback can stabilize this class of systems to an isolated equilibrium point. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose a simple control scheme that includes a low-amplitude periodic forcing function akin to so-called "active sensing" in biology, together with nonlinear output feedback. Our analysis shows that this approach leads to the emergence of an exponentially stable limit cycle. These findings offer a provably stable active sensing strategy and may thus help to rationalize the active sensing movements made by animals as they perform certain motor behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Novel Combined Data-Driven Approach for Electricity Theft Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-way flow of information and energy is an important feature of the Energy Internet. Data analytics is a powerful tool in the information flow that aims to solve practical problems using data mining techniques. As the problem of electricity thefts via tampering with smart meters continues to increase, the abnormal behaviors of thefts become more diversified and more difficult to detect. Thus, a data analytics method for detecting various types of electricity thefts is required. However, the existing methods either require a labeled dataset or additional system information which is difficult to obtain in reality or have poor detection accuracy. In this paper, we combine two novel data mining techniques to solve the problem. One technique is the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC), which can find the correlations between the non-technical loss (NTL) and a certain electricity behavior of the consumer. MIC can be used to precisely detect thefts that appear normal in shapes. The other technique is the clustering technique by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP). CFSFDP finds the abnormal users among thousands of load profiles, making it quite suitable for detecting electricity thefts with arbitrary shapes. Next, a framework for combining the advantages of the two techniques is proposed. Numerical experiments on the Irish smart meter dataset are conducted to show the good performance of the combined method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new framework for the resilient control of continuous-time linear systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and system uncertainty is presented. Integrating techniques from reinforcement learning and output regulation theory, it is shown that resilient optimal controllers can be learned directly from real-time state and input data collected from the systems subjected to attacks. Sufficient conditions are given under which the closed-loop system remains stable given any upper bound of DoS attack duration. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning-based framework for resilient control under DoS attacks and model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Control of Large-Scale Networks with Formal Guarantees: A Small-Gain Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a data-driven divide-and-conquer strategy to analyze large-scale interconnected networks, characterized by both unknown mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Our data-driven scheme treats an unknown network as an interconnection of individual agents (a.k.a. subsystems) and aims at constructing their symbolic models, referred to as discrete-domain representations of unknown agents, by collecting data from their trajectories. The primary objective is to synthesize a control strategy that guarantees desired behaviors over an unknown network by employing local controllers, derived from symbolic models of individual agents. To achieve this, we leverage the concept of alternating sub-bisimulation function (ASBF) to capture the closeness between state trajectories of each unknown agent and its data-driven symbolic model. Under a newly developed data-driven compositional condition, we then establish an alternating bisimulation function (ABF) between an unknown network and its symbolic model, based on ASBFs of individual agents, while providing correctness guarantees. Despite the sample complexity in existing work being exponential with respect to the network size, we demonstrate that our divide-and-conquer strategy significantly reduces it to a linear scale with respect to the number of agents. We also showcase that our data-driven compositional condition does not necessitate the traditional small-gain condition, which demands precise knowledge of the interconnection topology for its fulfillment. We apply our data-driven findings to two benchmarks comprising unknown networks with an arbitrary, a-priori undefined number of agents and unknown interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Mode transition control of large-size tiltrotor aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tiltrotors are an aircraft concept with the ability to rotate their rotors freely, achieving vertical take-off and fast forward flight. The combination of helicopter and fixed-wing flight into one aircraft provides versatility in mission selection, yet challenges persist in their construction and control. Tiltrotor aircraft can operate in three primary modes: helicopter, fixed-wing, and transition, with the transition mode facilitating the shift between helicopter and fixed-wing flight. However, control within this transition region is inherently challenging due to its non-linear nature, hence tiltrotors have been predominantly limited to military applications. Thus, this paper aims to explore transition mode control for a large-size tiltrotor aircraft, tailored to civil applications. A novel, large-sized, tiltrotor concept is presented, accompanied by a derived mathematical model describing the aircrafts behaviours. A PID control method has been used to control the height, pitch, and velocity variations within the transition mode with secondary control loop developed to control the tilt angle during transition. The derived model and control are then implemented within a MATLAB simulation, where the control method was iterated to improve performance. The results show a full transition was achieved in under 14 seconds, where altitude variations were kept below 10 metres. Though the transition mode control was successful, a collective look at the data showcases issues with assumptions as well as thrust discontinuities. The implications of these results are discussed, with suggested improvements proposed for future work.</description>

      <title>Robust Sliding Mode Control for Air-to-Air Missile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the missile guidance and control system the autopilot must overcome an array of variables and uncertainties to maintain tracking trajectory. A large uncertainty explored in this paper is the difference between the assumed flight dynamics, the controller design relies on, and the true flight dynamics the missile experiences. To capture these differences experimental wind tunnel data was used to represent real life aerodynamics whereas a low fidelity wing and tube structure was used for the controller dynamics. Other variables affecting controller performance are also quantified and explored in this paper, such as the changing mass, center of gravity, dynamic pressure, actuator bandwidth and sensor noise. A second order sliding mode controller utilizing an exponential reaching law was developed to overcome the cumulative uncertainties. The designed controller is capable of a 0.2s settling time and a 3% overshoot in ideal conditions. The controller relies on measurements of both dynamic pressure and angle of attack, when a 10% and 2% respective noise is introduced at 200Hz, the controller maintains a 5% steady state error and a time constant of 0.29s. The exponential reaching law provides superior chattering mitigation over traditional techniques like the tanh function, with no loss in controller performance.</description>

      <title>A System Parametrization for Direct Data-Driven Analysis and Control with Error-in-Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new parametrization to perform direct data-driven analysis and controller synthesis for the error-in-variables case. To achieve this, we employ the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to transform the problem into a linear fractional transformation (LFT) with unknown measurement errors and disturbances as uncertainties. For bounded uncertainties, we apply robust control techniques to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the H2-norm of the unknown true system. To this end, a single semidefinite program (SDP) needs to be solved, with complexity that is independent of the amount of data. Furthermore, we exploit the signal-to-noise ratio to provide a data-dependent condition, that characterizes whether the proposed parametrization can be employed. The modular formulation allows to extend this framework to controller synthesis with different performance criteria, input-output settings, and various system properties. Finally, we validate the proposed approach through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Detection of Critical Slowing Down in Epileptic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by abrupt seizures. Although seizures may appear random, they are often preceded by early warning signs in neural signals, notably, critical slowing down, a phenomenon in which the system's recovery rate from perturbations declines when it approaches a critical point. Detecting these markers could enable preventive therapies. This paper introduces a multi-stable slow-fast system to capture critical slowing down in epileptic dynamics. We construct regions of attraction for stable states, shedding light on how dynamic bifurcations drive pathological oscillations. We derive the recovery rate after perturbations to formalize critical slowing down. A novel algorithm for detecting precursors to ictal transitions is presented, along with a proof-of-concept event-based feedback control strategy to prevent impending pathological oscillations. Numerical studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Least Squares Algorithm for Linear Algebraic Equations via Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed algorithm for finding least squares solutions of linear algebraic equations with a scheduling protocol to further enhance its scalability. Each agent in the network is assumed to know some rows of the coefficient matrix and the corresponding entries in the observation vector. Unlike typical distributed algorithms, our approach considers communication bandwidth limits, allowing agents to transmit only a portion of their ``guessed" solution, independent of its dimension. A periodic scheduling protocol determines which portion is transmitted at each iteration. Assuming a small fixed step size and a diagonalizable algorithm matrix, we prove that agents' ``guessed" solutions converge exponentially to a least squares solution. For cases where the observation vectors are time-varying, a modified algorithm guarantees practical convergence, with tracking error bounded by the single-step variation in the observation vector. Simulations on both small-scale and medium-scale examples validate the feasibility of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Co-Scheduling of Energy and Production in Discrete Manufacturing Considering Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern discrete manufacturing requires real-time energy and production co-scheduling to reduce business costs. In discrete manufacturing, production lines and equipment are complex and numerous, which introduces significant uncertainty during the production process. Among these uncertainties, decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) pose additional challenges in finding optimal production strategies, as the signature or the shape of the uncertainty set cannot be determined before solving the model. However, existing research does not account for decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) present in discrete manufacturing; moreover, current algorithms for solving models with DDUs suffer from high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for the real-time control requirements of modern industry. To this end, we proposed an energy-production co-scheduling model for discrete manufacturing, taking into account decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs). Subsequently, we devised a method for transforming the constraints associated with DDUs into linear form ones. Finally, we designed a novel algorithm based on the column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;CG) algorithm and undertook a theoretical analysis of its performance of convergence and algorithmic complexity. A real-world engine assembly line was used to test our model and algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces production costs and achieves better frequency regulation performance.</description>

      <title>FlexiGen: Stochastic Dataset Generator for Electric Vehicle Charging Energy Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RES) are vital components of sustainable energy systems, yet their uncoordinated integration can pose substantial challenges to grid stability, such as unmanaged peak loads and energy balance issues. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), offer a promising solution to address these challenges by enabling bidirectional energy flow between EVs and the grid. As such, EVs can be used in advances Demand Response (DR) strategies to optimize energy use and mitigate the intermittency of renewable generation. To reach such advantages, optimization algorithms need data on EV energy flexibility, such as charging patterns and usage preferences. However, data collection remains constrained by challenges such as high costs, user engagement, data privacy concerns, and limited access to open-source datasets on EV energy flexibility. This paper presents FlexiGen an open-source stochastic dataset generator tool designed to overcome the data limitations in EV flexibility for V2G and V1G DR applications. FlexiGen generates synthetic datasets encompassing realist EV usage patterns, behaviours and flexibility scenarios for household and office routines. To generate these datasets, FlexiGen uses a series of configurable probabilistic variables, such as stochastic user routines, traffic conditions, charger types, car average electricity consumption and State of Charge (SoC). The generated datasets include an hourly routine with the EV State of connection, Destination Charger, Estimated Departure Time, Required SOC at Departure, Estimated Arrival Time, and Estimated SOC at Arrival. Accompanying this publication an example dataset is generated for 3 households with 1 EV each, and 1 office building with 3 EVs. The generated dataset is analyzed and discussed on the paper and published alongside the open-source code for FlexiGen tool.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization for Low-Carbon Dispatch in a Combined Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While wind and solar power contribute to sustainability, their intermittent nature poses challenges when integrated into the grid. To mitigate these issues, renewable energy can be combined with coal fired power and hydropower sources to stabilize the energy system, with battery storage serving as a backup source to smooth the total output. This study develops a low carbon dispatch model for a combined energy system using a two stage stochastic optimization approach. The model incorporates a carbon trading mechanism to regulate emissions and addresses the uncertainty in wind and solar outputs by clustering output curves into typical scenarios to derive a joint distribution. In the initial stage of scheduling, decisions are made regarding the unit commitment for coal fired power plants. The second stage optimizes the expected operation cost of other energy generation sources. The feasibility of the model is demonstrated by comparing the results of stochastic and deterministic scenarios through simulation. Analysis of different carbon prices further explores the impact of the carbon trading mechanism on the system's operation cost.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Semantic Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on semantic considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, semantic scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based semantic scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by semantic communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Control of Nonholonomic Robots Based on a Bilinear Koopman Realization: Data Does Not Replace Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning and the growing trend towards effortless data generation in real-world systems has led to an increasing interest for data-inferred models and data-based control in robotics. It seems appealing to govern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate pipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller design. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains many vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g., typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient, computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in robotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in Koopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models can be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots. In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the complete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design - when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a second-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only real-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware experiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive controllers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant concerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying geometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some geometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with large amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Circulating Currents in Electric Machines: Positive Impact of The End Windings Length on Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating currents occurring in windings of electric machines received rising interest recent years. Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Metaheuristics Through Opposition-Based Learning in Optimum Locating of Control Systems in Tall Buildings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opposition-based learning (OBL) is an effective approach to improve the performance of metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which are commonly used for solving complex engineering problems. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of opposition strategies in metaheuristic optimization algorithms, discussing the benefits and limitations of this approach. An overview of the opposition strategy concept, its various implementations, and its impact on the performance of metaheuristic algorithms are presented. Furthermore, case studies on the application of opposition strategies in engineering problems are provided, including the optimum locating of control systems in tall building. A shear frame with Magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper is considered as a case study. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of opposition strategies in metaheuristic algorithms significantly enhances the quality and speed of the optimization process. This chapter aims to provide a clear understanding of the opposition strategy in metaheuristic optimization algorithms and its engineering applications, with the ultimate goal of facilitating its adoption in real-world engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Industrial Control using an Agentic Framework with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As chemical plants evolve towards full autonomy, the need for effective fault handling and control in dynamic, unpredictable environments becomes increasingly critical. This paper proposes an innovative approach to industrial automation, introducing validation and reprompting architectures utilizing large language model (LLM)-based autonomous control agents. The proposed agentic system, comprising of operator, validator, and reprompter agents, enables autonomous management of control tasks, adapting to unforeseen disturbances without human intervention. By utilizing validation and reprompting architectures, the framework allows agents to recover from errors and continuously improve decision-making in real-time industrial scenarios. We hypothesize that this mechanism will enhance performance and reliability across a variety of LLMs, offering a path toward fully autonomous systems capable of handling unexpected challenges, paving the way for robust, adaptive control in complex industrial environments. To demonstrate the concept's effectiveness, we created a simple case study involving a temperature control experiment embedded on a microcontroller device, validating the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Personalized Hierarchical Split Federated Learning in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme resource constraints make large-scale machine learning (ML) with distributed clients challenging in wireless networks. On the one hand, large-scale ML requires massive information exchange between clients and server(s). On the other hand, these clients have limited battery and computation powers that are often dedicated to operational computations. Split federated learning (SFL) is emerging as a potential solution to mitigate these challenges, by splitting the ML model into client-side and server-side model blocks, where only the client-side block is trained on the client device. However, practical applications require personalized models that are suitable for the client's personal task. Motivated by this, we propose a personalized hierarchical split federated learning (PHSFL) algorithm that is specially designed to achieve better personalization performance. More specially, owing to the fact that regardless of the severity of the statistical data distributions across the clients, many of the features have similar attributes, we only train the body part of the federated learning (FL) model while keeping the (randomly initialized) classifier frozen during the training phase. We first perform extensive theoretical analysis to understand the impact of model splitting and hierarchical model aggregations on the global model. Once the global model is trained, we fine-tune each client classifier to obtain the personalized models. Our empirical findings suggest that while the globally trained model with the untrained classifier performs quite similarly to other existing solutions, the fine-tuned models show significantly improved personalized performance.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Semantic Communication and Cooperative Tracking Control for a UAV Swarm over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semantic communication and cooperative tracking control for an UAV swarm comprising a leader UAV and a group of follower UAVs, all interconnected via unreliable wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Initially, we develop a dynamic model for the UAV swarm that accounts for both the internal interactions among the cooperative follower UAVs and the imperfections inherent in the MIMO channels that interlink the leader and follower UAVs. Building on this model, we incorporate the power costs of the UAVs and formulate the communication and cooperative tracking control challenge as a drift-plus-penalty optimization problem. We then derive a closed-form optimal solution that maintains a decentralized semantic architecture, dynamically adjusting to the tracking error costs and local channel conditions within the swarm. Employing Lyapunov drift analysis, we establish closed-form sufficient conditions for the stabilization of the UAV swarm's tracking performance. Numerical results demonstrate the significant enhancements in our proposed scheme over various state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Harpocrates: Oblivious Privacy in a Statically Typed World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (FWMAV) have a host of potential applications such as environmental monitoring, artificial pollination, and search and rescue operations. One of the challenges for achieving these applications is the implementation of an onboard sensor suite due to the small size and limited payload capacity of FWMAVs. The current solution for accurate state estimation is the use of offboard motion capture cameras, thus restricting vehicle operation to a special flight arena. In addition, the small payload capacity and highly non-linear oscillating dynamics of FWMAVs makes state estimation using onboard sensors challenging due to limited compute power and sensor noise. In this paper, we develop a novel hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing pipeline that recreates flight trajectories of the Harvard RoboBee, a 100mg FWMAV. We apply this testing pipeline to evaluate a potential suite of sensors for robust altitude and attitude estimation by implementing and characterizing a Complimentary Extended Kalman Filter. The HWIL system includes a mechanical noise generator, such that both trajectories and oscillatinos can be emulated and evaluated. Our onboard sensing package works towards the future goal of enabling fully autonomous control for micro-aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Is Linear Feedback on Smoothed Dynamics Sufficient for Stabilizing Contact-Rich Plans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.</description>

      <title>EO-GRAPE and EO-DRLPE: Open and Closed Loop Approaches for Energy Efficient Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the possibility of using quantum optimal control techniques to co-optimize the energetic cost and the process fidelity of a quantum unitary gate. The energetic cost is theoretically defined, and thereby, the gradient of the energetic cost for pulse engineering is derived. We empirically demonstrate the Pareto optimality in the trade-off between process fidelity and energetic cost. Thereafter, two novel numerical quantum optimal control approaches are proposed: (i) energy-optimized gradient ascent pulse engineering (EO-GRAPE) as an open-loop gradient-based method, and (ii) energy-optimized deep reinforcement learning for pulse engineering (EO-DRLPE) as a closed-loop method. The performance of both methods is probed in the presence of increasing noise. We find that the EO-GRAPE method performs better than the EO-DRLPE methods with and without a warm start for most experimental settings. Additionally, for one qubit unitary gate, we illustrate the correlation between the Bloch sphere path length and the energetic cost.</description>

      <title>DP and QP Based Decision-making and Planning for Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology is rapidly evolving and becoming a pivotal element of modern automation systems. Effective decision-making and planning are essential to ensuring autonomous vehicles operate safely and efficiently in complex environments. This paper introduces a decision-making and planning framework for autonomous vehicles, leveraging dynamic programming (DP) for global path planning and quadratic programming (QP) for local trajectory optimization. The proposed approach utilizes S-T graphs to achieve both dynamic and static obstacle avoidance. A comprehensive vehicle dynamics model supports the control system, enabling precise path tracking and obstacle handling. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the system's performance in a variety of scenarios, including global path planning, static obstacle avoidance, and dynamic obstacle avoidance involving pedestrian interactions. The results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed decision-making and planning algorithms in navigating complex environments, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of the sixth generation of communication networks (6G) has been gaining momentum over the past years, with a target of being introduced by 2030. Several initiatives worldwide are developing innovative solutions and setting the direction for the key features of these networks. Some common emerging themes are the tight integration of AI, the convergence of multiple access technologies and sustainable operation, aiming to meet stringent performance and societal requirements. To that end, we are introducing REASON - Realising Enabling Architectures and Solutions for Open Networks. The REASON project aims to address technical challenges in future network deployments, such as E2E service orchestration, sustainability, security and trust management, and policy management, utilising AI-native principles, considering multiple access technologies and cloud-native solutions.
  This paper presents REASON's architecture and the identified requirements for future networks. The architecture is meticulously designed for modularity, interoperability, scalability, simplified troubleshooting, flexibility, and enhanced security, taking into consideration current and future standardisation efforts, and the ease of implementation and training. It is structured into four horizontal layers: Physical Infrastructure, Network Service, Knowledge, and End-User Application, complemented by two vertical layers: Management and Orchestration, and E2E Security. This layered approach ensures a robust, adaptable framework to support the diverse and evolving requirements of 6G networks, fostering innovation and facilitating seamless integration of advanced technologies.</description>

Abstract: Transforming an asymmetric system into a symmetric system makes it possible to exploit the simplifying properties of symmetry in control problems. We define and characterize the family of symmetrizable systems. These systems can be transformed into symmetric systems by a linear transformation of their inputs and outputs. We show that a Khatri-Rao rank needs to be satisfied for a system to be symmetrizable. We conclude that linear systems are generically neither symmetric nor symmetrizable.</description>

      <title>To Train or Not to Train: Balancing Efficiency and Training Cost in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key component of 6G networks, as it enables communication and computing services to adapt to end users' requirements and demand patterns. The management of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a meaningful example of AI application: computational resources available at the network edge need to be carefully allocated to users, whose jobs may have different priorities and latency requirements. The research community has developed several AI algorithms to perform this resource allocation, but it has neglected a key aspect: learning is itself a computationally demanding task, and considering free training results in idealized conditions and performance in simulations. In this work, we consider a more realistic case in which the cost of learning is specifically accounted for, presenting a new algorithm to dynamically select when to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that allocates resources. Our method is highly general, as it can be directly applied to any scenario involving a training overhead, and it can approach the same performance as an ideal learning agent even under realistic training conditions.</description>

      <title>OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07087v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Joint Age-State Belief is All You Need: Minimizing AoII via Pull-Based Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age of incorrect information (AoII) is a recently proposed freshness and mismatch metric that penalizes an incorrect estimation along with its duration. Therefore, keeping track of AoII requires the knowledge of both the source and estimation processes. In this paper, we consider a time-slotted pull-based remote estimation system under a sampling rate constraint where the information source is a general discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) process. Moreover, packet transmission times from the source to the monitor are non-zero which disallows the monitor to have perfect information on the actual AoII process at any time. Hence, for this pull-based system, we propose the monitor to maintain a sufficient statistic called {\em belief} which stands for the joint distribution of the age and source processes to be obtained from the history of all observations. Using belief, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to be used at the monitor as opposed to existing martingale estimators in the literature. Second, we obtain the optimality equations from the belief-MDP (Markov decision process) formulation. Finally, we propose two belief-dependent policies one of which is based on deep reinforcement learning, and the other one is a threshold-based policy based on the instantaneous expected AoII.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Algebraic Framework for Verification and Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is a critical property for control systems in medicine, transportation, manufacturing, and other applications, and can be defined as ensuring positive invariance of a predefined safe set. This paper investigates the problems of verifying positive invariance of a semi-algebraic set as well as synthesizing sets that can be made positive invariant through Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based control. The key to our approach consists of mapping conditions for positive invariance to sum-of-squares constraints via the Positivstellensatz from real algebraic geometry. Based on these conditions, we propose a framework for verifying safety of CBF-based control including single CBFs, high-order CBFs, multi-CBFs, and systems with trigonometric dynamics and actuation constraints.
  In the area of synthesis, we propose algorithms for constructing CBFs, namely, an alternating-descent approach and a local CBF approach. We evaluate our approach through case studies on quadrotor UAV and power converter test systems.</description>

      <title>Sigma-point Kalman Filter with Nonlinear Unknown Input Estimation via Optimization and Data-driven Approach for Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most works on joint state and unknown input (UI) estimation require the assumption that the UIs are linear; this is potentially restrictive as it does not hold in many intelligent autonomous systems. To overcome this restriction and circumvent the need to linearize the system, we propose a derivative-free Unknown Input Sigma-point Kalman Filter (SPKF-nUI) where the SPKF is interconnected with a general nonlinear UI estimator that can be implemented via nonlinear optimization and data-driven approaches. The nonlinear UI estimator uses the posterior state estimate which is less susceptible to state prediction error. In addition, we introduce a joint sigma-point transformation scheme to incorporate both the state and UI uncertainties in the estimation of SPKF-nUI. An in-depth stochastic stability analysis proves that the proposed SPKF-nUI yields exponentially converging estimation error bounds under reasonable assumptions. Finally, two case studies are carried out on a simulation-based rigid robot and a physical soft robot, i.e., robots made of soft materials with complex dynamics to validate effectiveness of the proposed filter on nonlinear dynamic systems. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPKF-nUI achieves the lowest state and UI estimation errors when compared to the existing nonlinear state-UI filters.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Service in Connected Microgrids: Storage Planning and Optimal Power Sharing Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power distribution grids poses challenges to system reliability due to the inherent uncertainty in their power production. To address this issue, battery energy sources (BESs) are being increasingly used as a promising solution to counter the uncertainty associated with RES power production. During the overall system planning stage, the optimal capacity of the BES has to be decided. In the operational phase, policies on when to charge the BESs and when to use them to support loads must be determined so that the BES remains within its operating range, avoiding depletion of charge on one hand and remaining within acceptable margins of maximum charge on the other. In this paper, a stochastic control framework is used to determine battery capacity, for microgrids, which ensures that during the operational phase, BESs' operating range is respected with pre-specified high probability. We provide an explicit analytical expression of the required BESs energy capacity for a single microgrid with RES as the main power source. Leveraging insights from the single microgrid case, the article focuses on the design and planning of BESs for the two-microgrid scenario. In this setting, microgrids are allowed to share power while respecting the capacity constraints imposed by the power lines. We characterize the optimal power transfer policy between the microgrids and the optimal BES capacity for multiple microgrids. This provides the BES savings arising from connecting the microgrids.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Metaplasticity for Continual Learning with Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08718v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices operating in dynamic environments critically need the ability to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting. The strict resource constraints in these devices pose a major challenge to achieve this, as continual learning entails memory and computational overhead. Crossbar architectures using memristor devices offer energy efficiency through compute-in-memory and hold promise to address this issue. However, memristors often exhibit low precision and high variability in conductance modulation, rendering them unsuitable for continual learning solutions that require precise modulation of weight magnitude for consolidation. Current approaches fall short to address this challenge directly and rely on auxiliary high-precision memory, leading to frequent memory access, high memory overhead, and energy dissipation. In this research, we propose probabilistic metaplasticity, which consolidates weights by modulating their update probability rather than magnitude. The proposed mechanism eliminates high-precision modification to weight magnitudes and, consequently, the need for auxiliary high-precision memory. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism by integrating probabilistic metaplasticity into a spiking network trained on an error threshold with low-precision memristor weights. Evaluations of continual learning benchmarks show that probabilistic metaplasticity achieves performance equivalent to state-of-the-art continual learning models with high-precision weights while consuming ~ 67% lower memory for additional parameters and up to ~ 60x lower energy during parameter updates compared to an auxiliary memory-based solution. The proposed model shows potential for energy-efficient continual learning with low-precision emerging devices.</description>

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a popular technique that facilitates their solution by provably guaranteeing safety, through their forward invariance property, at the expense of some performance loss. This approach involves defining a performance objective alongside CBF-based safety constraints that must always be enforced. Unfortunately, both performance and solution feasibility can be significantly impacted by two key factors: (i) the selection of the cost function and associated parameters, and (ii) the calibration of parameters within the CBF-based constraints, which capture the trade-off between performance and conservativeness. %as well as infeasibility. To address these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CBFs (MPC-CBF). In particular, we parameterize our controller and use bilevel optimization, where RL is used to learn the optimal parameters while MPC computes the optimal control input. We validate our method by applying it to the challenging automated merging control problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at conflicting roadways. Results demonstrate improved performance and a significant reduction in the number of infeasible cases compared to traditional heuristic approaches used for tuning CBF-based controllers, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of the Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. This model is applicable in scenarios where the opinions pertain to the usage of resources, such as money, time, computational resources etc. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Aggregator of Electric Vehicles Bidding in Nordic FCR-D Markets: A Chance-Constrained Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Danish system operator, Energinet, has recently introduced an innovative grid code called the P90 requirement, which allows stochastic flexible resources to bid their flexibility in Nordic ancillary service markets, contingent upon a minimum 90% probability of successfully realizing the reserve capacity bid. For limited-energy resources, Energinet imposes additional requirements for participation in these markets. Given these requirements, this paper presents a chance-constrained optimization model designed for aggregators of electric vehicles, aiming to optimally place reserve capacity bids in the Nordic Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D) market while accounting for uncertainty in future consumption baselines. We analyze both FCR-D up and down markets, reformulating and solving the proposed joint chance-constrained model using two sample-based methods. Using real data from 1,400 charging stations in Denmark from March 2022 to March 2023, we demonstrate the out-of-sample profit potential. Our findings indicate that vehicle owners could save between 6% and 10% on their annual electricity bills by providing FCR-D services. Additionally, we observed a synergy effect, where having more vehicles in a single portfolio enables larger bids per vehicle compared to a collective bid from multiple portfolios with the same total number of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain an active particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts by developing a novel physics-informed reinforcement learning strategy and comparing it with prescribed control and physics-agnostic reinforcement learning strategies. Our scheme, coined the actor-physicist, is an adaptation of the actor-critic algorithm in which the neural network parameterized critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function, the physicist. We validate the proposed physics-informed reinforcement learning approach through extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic BK and more realistic Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow environments, demonstrating its superiority in controlling particle dynamics when compared to standard reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Dual Grid-Forming Converter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a dual model for grid-forming (GFM) controlled converters. The model is inspired from the observation that the structures of the active and reactive power equations of lossy synchronous machine models are almost symmetrical in terms of armature resistance and transient reactance. The proposed device is able to compensate grid power unbalance without requiring a frequency signal. In fact, the active power control is based on the rate of change of the voltage magnitude. On the other hand, synchronization and frequency control is obtained through the reactive power support. The letter shows that the proposed dual-GFM control is robust and capable of recovering a normal operating condition following large contingencies, such as load outages and three-phase faults.</description>

      <title>To What Extent do Open-loop and Feedback Nash Equilibria Diverge in General-Sum Linear Quadratic Dynamic Games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic games offer a versatile framework for modeling the evolving interactions of strategic agents, whose steady-state behavior can be captured by the Nash equilibria of the games. Nash equilibria are often computed in feedback, with policies depending on the state at each time, or in open-loop, with policies depending only on the initial state. Empirically, open-loop Nash equilibria (OLNE) could be more efficient to compute, while feedback Nash equilibria (FBNE) often encode more complex interactions. However, it remains unclear exactly which dynamic games yield FBNE and OLNE that differ significantly and which do not. To address this problem, we present a principled comparison study of OLNE and FBNE in linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games. Specifically, we prove that the OLNE strategies of an LQ dynamic game can be synthesized by solving the coupled Riccati equations of an auxiliary LQ game with perturbed costs. The construction of the auxiliary game allows us to establish conditions under which OLNE and FBNE coincide and derive an upper bound on the deviation between FBNE and OLNE of an LQ game.</description>

      <title>Invisible Manipulation Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Stealthy Attacks on Battery Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces "invisible manipulation," an innovative cyber-attack mechanism achieved through strategically timed stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs). By stealthily manipulating measurements of a critical asset prior to the target time period, the attacker can subtly guide the engineering system toward a predetermined operational state without detection. Using the battery energy management system (BEMS) as a case study, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate synthetic measurements, such as battery voltage and current, that align closely with actual measurements. These synthetic measurements, falling within the acceptable error margin of residual-based bad data detection algorithm provided by state estimation, can evade detection and mislead Extended Kalman-filter-based State of Charge estimation. Subsequently, considering the deceptive data as valid inputs, the BEMS will operate the BESS towards the attacker desired operational states when the targeted time period come. The use of the DRL-based scheme allows us to covert an online optimization problem into an offline training process, thereby alleviating the computational burden for real-time implementation. Comprehensive testing on a high-fidelity microgrid real-time simulation testbed validates the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods in achieving different attack objectives.</description>

Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and compute optimal control inputs using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework allows for customization of transient behavior, addressing limitations of existing methods. The Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture facilitates training and ensures accurate state estimation. Optimal control strategies are demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>KPCA for Thrust Vectoring Systems Exhibiting Singular Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of thrust vectoring systems, which are nonlinear, overactuated, and time-invariant. We assume that the system is composed of two subsystems and there exist singular points around which the linearized system is uncontrollable. Furthermore, we assume that the system is stabilizable through a two-level control allocation. In this particular setting, we cannot do much with the linearized system, and a direct nonlinear control approach must be used to analyze the system stability. Under adequate assumptions and a suitable nonlinear continuous control-allocation law, we can prove uniform asymptotic convergence of the points of equilibrium using Lyapunov input-to-state stability and the small gain theorem. This control allocation, however, requires the design of an allocated mapping and introduces two exogenous inputs. In particular, the closed-loop system is cascaded, and the output of one subsystem is the disturbance of the other, and vice versa. In general, it is difficult to find a closed-form solution for the allocated mapping; it needs to satisfy restrictive conditions, among which Lipschitz continuity to ensure that the disturbances eventually vanish. Additionally, this mapping is in general nontrivial and non-unique. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based predictive control allocation to substitute the need for designing an analytic mapping, and assess if it can produce a meaningful mapping ``on-the-fly" by solving online an optimization problem. The simulations include three examples, which are the manipulation of an object through an unmanned aerial vehicle in two and three dimensions, and the control of a surface vessel actuated by two azimuthal thrusters.</description>

      <title>Toward Standardized Performance Evaluation of Flow-guided Nanoscale Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale devices with Terahertz (THz) communication capabilities are envisioned to be deployed within human bloodstreams. Such devices will enable fine-grained sensing-based applications for detecting early indications (i.e., biomarkers) of various health conditions, as well as actuation-based ones such as targeted drug delivery. Associating the locations of such events with the events themselves would provide an additional utility for precision diagnostics and treatment. This vision yielded a new class of in-body localization coined under the term "flow-guided nanoscale localization". Such localization can be piggybacked on THz communication for detecting body regions in which biological events were observed based on the duration of one circulation of a nanodevice in the bloodstream. From a decades-long research on objective benchmarking of "traditional" indoor localization, as well as its eventual standardization (e.g., ISO/IEC 18305:2016), we know that in early stages the reported performance results were often incomplete (e.g., targeting a subset of relevant performance metrics), carrying out benchmarking experiments in different evaluation environments and scenarios, and utilizing inconsistent performance indicators. To avoid such a "lock-in" in flow-guided localization, in this paper we propose a workflow for standardized performance evaluation of such localization. The workflow is implemented in the form of an open-source simulation framework that is able to jointly account for the mobility of the nanodevices, in-body THz communication between with on-body anchors, and energy-related and other technological constraints (e.g., pulse-based modulation) at the nanodevice level. Accounting for these constraints, the framework is able to generate the raw data that can be streamlined into different flow-guided localization solutions for generating standardized performance benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Orchestration Framework for Open System Models with Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional on-board hardware to monitor the propagation environment and conduct local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices. While implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RISs, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges. We examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system under minimal design choices that reflect the essential elements and stringent conditions, including (a) two extremes of implementation complexity realized through minimalist operational designs of two HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We provide empirical evidence showing that autonomous RIS holds promise even under these strict conditions and propose new research directions, particularly for advancing the understanding of probe distortion.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent feedback control of an N-level atom with multiple excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <title>A WECC-based Model for Simulating Two-stage Market Clearing with High-temporal-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source model for simulating two-stage market clearing based on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council Anchor Data Set. We model accurate two-stage market clearing with day-ahead unit commitment at hourly resolution and real-time economic dispatch with five-minute resolution. Both day-ahead unit commitment and real-time economic dispatch can incorporate look-ahead rolling horizons. The model includes seven market regions and a full year of data, detailing 2,403 individual generation assets across diverse energy sources. The year-long simulation demonstrates the capability of our model to closely reflect the generation and price patterns of the California ISO. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that extending the ED look-ahead horizon reduces system costs by up to 0.12%. We expect this new system model to fulfill the needs of conducting electricity market analysis at finer time granularity for market designs and emerging technology integration. While we focus on the western interconnection, the model serves as a base to simulate other two-stage clearing market locations.</description>

Abstract: Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of non-parametric linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are known and well-investigated. In this work, using the general framework of $\mathcal{L}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of parametric stationary problems, we derive interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2 \otimes \mathcal{L}_2$-optimality conditions for parametric LTI systems with a general pole-residue form. We then specialize this result to recover known conditions for systems with parameter-independent poles and develop new conditions for a certain class of systems with parameter-dependent poles.</description>

Abstract: In systems modelling, a 'system' typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a 'resource semantics' of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate &amp; Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$: Trajectory Optimization with Uniform Error Guarantees under Path Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Modeling with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hysteresis modeling is crucial to comprehend the behavior of magnetic devices, facilitating optimal designs. Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, three neural operators-deep operator network, Fourier neural operator, and wavelet neural operator-are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.

      <title>Multi-Scale Cell Decomposition for Path Planning using Restrictive Routing Potential Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In burgeoning domains, like urban goods distribution, the advent of aerial cargo transportation necessitates the development of routing solutions that prioritize safety. This paper introduces Larp, a novel path planning framework that leverages the concept of restrictive potential fields as cost maps to forge demonstrably safe routes. The algorithm achieves it by segmenting the potential field into a hierarchy of cells, each with a designated restriction zone determined by the obstacles proximity. While the primary impetus behind Larp is to enhance the safety of aerial pathways for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), its utility extends to a wide array of path planning scenarios. Comparative analyses with both established and contemporary potential field-based methods reveal Larp's proficiency in maintaining a safe distance from restrictions and its adeptness in circumventing local minima.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff: An Effective Generative Diffusion Model for Sampling-Free Dynamic Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

      <title>Sparse Mamba: Introducing Controllability, Observability, And Stability To Structural State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state space models' (SSMs) development in recent studies, such as Mamba and Mamba2, outperformed and solved the computational inefficiency of transformers and large language models at small to medium scale. In this work, we introduce the concept of controllability and observability to the original Mamba SSM's architecture in our Sparse-Mamba (S-Mamba) for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Moreover, we reinforce stability on the $nxn$ $A$ matrix on Mmaba2. The Mamba SSMs architecture drops the need for attention layers or multilayer perception blocks in transformers. However, current Mamba models lack reinforcement of controllability in state-space equations for computing the $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ matrices at each time step, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Furthermore, the $A$ matrix in Mamba2 is not always stable. We demonstrate a reduction of parameters compared to the first published Mamba and Mamba2. We showcase an improvement in perplexity by 5\% and a decrease in training time by 3\% after reinforcing controllability and observability on the original Mamba architecture in our proposed S-Mamba. We further enforce stability on the $A$ matrix in Mamba2 to improve the loss and perplexity of the model. The controllable and stable $n \times n$ state matrix $A$ is sparse, and it has only $n$ free parameters. Our novel approach will ensure controllable/observable and stable SSMs, which will be the gate key for Mamba3.</description>

      <title>GLinSAT: The General Linear Satisfiability Neural Network Layer By Accelerated Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/HunterTracer/GLinSAT}.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the values of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between experimental data and numerical approximations of the behavior of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations of the models that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>

      <title>Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</description>
