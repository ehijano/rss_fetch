      <title>Propulsive transitions and scaling relations of a heaving flexible foil in a cylinder wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the propulsive dynamics of a heaving flexible foil immersed in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder, focusing on the coupled effects of unsteady wake forcing, passive structural flexibility, and prescribed heaving kinematics. The analysis employs a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction solver based on a partitioned variational formulation with a nonlinear iterative force correction scheme. Systematic simulations are conducted over a broad parameter space of dimensionless heaving amplitude and frequency at a Reynolds number of 3000. Five distinct response modes are identified, namely full-wake, semi-wake, full-wake-flexible, semi-wake-flexible, and vortex-flexible, based on propulsive transitions and associated flow features. An empirical boundary plane is discovered, separating regimes where the wake hinders lift performance (wake-dominated) from those where it enhances performance (flapping-dominated). Scaling relations for the force and power coefficients are formulated by decomposing the contributions of quasi-steady motion, added-mass effects, structural curvature, wake momentum deficit, and transverse flow gradients. At sufficiently large amplitude and frequency, a two-way lock-in emerges: the foil not only synchronizes with the cylinder shedding but also modulates it, accelerating the wake and enhancing lift.Flexibility is found to be detrimental in fully immersed wakes but beneficial in partial wakes, where it creates extra suction without much extra drag in the semi-wake-flexible mode. These findings elucidate the energy-saving and maneuverability strategies employed by biological propulsors and provide predictive guidelines for the design of bio-inspired energy harvesters and unmanned vehicles in disturbed flows.</description>

      <title>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</description>

      <title>Capillary Rise in Pipes with Variable Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an ODE model for a capillary rise in pipes with variable cross section and compares it to the lubrication theory model. Two key assumptions are made: (1) radius of the pipe varies with axial coordinate, and (2) pipe's convergence angle is small. The model reduction process involves the identification of critical parameters and simplifies the governing equations by neglecting higher-order terms. Under appropriate scaling, it is shown that generalized Washburn's equation for capillary rise in pipes with variable cross section reduces to the known lubrication theory model.</description>

      <title>Influence of dissolved gas concentration on the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles at the air-liquid interface are important for many natural and industrial processes. Factors influencing the lifetime of such surface bubbles have been investigated extensively, yet the impact of dissolved gas concentration remains unexplored. Here we investigate how the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids depends on the dissolved gas concentration. The bubble lifetime is found to decrease with the dissolved gas concentration. Larger microbubbles at increased gas concentration are found to trigger bubble bursting at earlier times. Combined with the thinning rate of the bubble cap thickness, a scaling law of the bubble lifetime is developed. Our findings may provide new insight on bubble and foam stability.</description>

      <title>Steady advection-diffusion in multiply-connected potential flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the steady heat transfer between a collection of impermeable obstacles immersed in an incompressible 2D potential flow, when each obstacle has a prescribed boundary temperature distribution. Inside the fluid, the temperature satisfies a variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equation (PDE), the solution of which usually requires expensive techniques. To solve this problem efficiently, we construct multiply-connected conformal maps under which both the domain and governing equation are greatly simplified. In particular, each obstacle is mapped to a horizontal slit and the governing equation becomes a constant-coefficient elliptic PDE. We then develop a boundary integral approach in the mapped domain to solve for the temperature field when arbitrary Dirichlet temperature data is specified on the obstacles. The inverse conformal map is then used to compute the temperature field in the physical domain. We construct our multiply-connected conformal maps by exploiting the flexible and highly accurate AAA-LS algorithm. In multiply-connected domains and domains with non-constant boundary temperature data, we note similarities and key differences in the temperature fields and Nusselt number scalings as compared to the isothermal simply-connected problem analyzed by Choi et al. (2005). In particular, we derive new asymptotic expressions for the Nusselt number in the case of arbitrary non-constant temperature data in singly connected domains at low P\'eclet number, and verify these scalings numerically. While our language focuses on the problem of conjugate heat transfer, our methods and findings are equally applicable to the advection-diffusion of any passive scalar in a potential flow.</description>

      <title>Capillary hysteresis induced by gap-resolved meniscus dynamics on Faraday instability in Hele-Shaw cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theoretical analyses on Faraday waves in Hele-Shaw cells typically adopt gap-averaged governing equations and rely on Hamraoui's model coming from molecular kinetics theory, thereby oversimplifying essential transverse information, such as contact line velocity and capillary hysteresis, and conflicting with the unsteady meniscus dynamics. In this paper, a gap-resolved approach is developed by directly modeling the transverse gap flow and the contact angle dynamics, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations, ultimately yielding a modified damping with respect to the static contact angle and hysteresis range. A novel amplitude equation for Faraday waves is derived that combines this damping and the gap-averaged counterpart based on the oscillatory Stokes boundary layer, with the viscous dissipation preserved. By means of Lyapunov's first method, an explicit analytical expression for the critical stability boundary is established. Two series of laboratory experiments are performed that focus, respectively, on evolutions of the lateral meniscus and the longitudinal free surface near the Faraday onset, from which key parameters relevant to the theory are precisely measured. Based on the experimental data, the validity of the proposed mathematical model for addressing the Faraday instability problem in Hele-Shaw cells is confirmed, and the generation and development mechanisms of the onset are clarified. We find that the dispersion relation is significantly affected by the pinned contact line constraints, which partially compensate for the detuning caused by oscillatory Stokes flow approximation.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Turbulent Transport in Decaying 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on the transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. Turbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves through nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent structures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial vorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively distinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle trajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian framework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such as absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and velocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily governed by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing fraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of behaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between anisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing, flow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated by the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also influenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping rotational motion and random walks, and L\'evy flight-like events. These findings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from laboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical structures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of a partially loaded intermodal container freight train passing through a tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bluff nature of a freight train locomotive, coupled with large gaps created between different wagon formations and loaded goods, influence the overall pressure wave pattern generated as the train passes through a tunnel. Typically, 1D models are used to predict the patterns and properties of tunnel pressure wave formations. However, accurate modelling of regions of separation at the head of the blunted containers and at unloaded gap sections is essential for precise predictions of pressure magnitudes. This has traditionally been difficult to capture with 1D models. Furthermore, achieving this accuracy through 3D computational methods demands exceptional mesh quality, significant computational resources, and the careful selection of numerical models. This paper evaluates various numerical models to capture these complexities within regions of flow separation. Findings have supported the development of a new 1D programme to calculate the pressure wave generated by a freight locomotive entering a tunnel, and is here further extended to consider the discontinuities of the train body created by intermodal container loading patterns, by implementing new mesh system and boundary conditions into the 1D programme. A parameterisation study for different loading configurations is also presented to improve the overall programme adaptability, and the relationship between predetermined parameters and gap length is investigated. We validate the effectiveness of the improved 1D model through comprehensive Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results and conduct an extensive parameterisation study to enhance its applicability across various loading configurations. Consequently, this research bridges the gap in freight train tunnel aerodynamics, offering a versatile 1D numerical tool for accurate pressure wave prediction.</description>

      <title>The reflection-transmission problem for inertial waves on geostrophic shear layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial waves in fluid regions of planets and stars play an important role in their dynamics and evolution, through energy, heat and angular momentum transport and mixing of chemicals. While inertial wave propagation in flows prescribed by solid-body rotation is well-understood, natural environments are often characterized by convection or zonal flows. In these more realistic configurations, we do not yet understand the propagation of inertial waves or their transport properties. In this work, we focus on the interaction between inertial waves and geostrophic currents, which has thus far only been investigated using ray theory, where the wave length is assumed to be small relative to the length scale of the current, or averaging/statistical approaches. We develop a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model to investigate the reflection and transmission of inertial waves in the presence of a localized geostrophic shear layer of arbitrary width and compare our theoretical findings to a set of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, in contrast to ray theory predictions, partial reflections occur even in subcritical shear layers and tunnelling with almost total transmission is possible in supercritical shear layers, if the layer is thin compared to the wavelength. That is, supercritical shear layers act as low-pass filters for inertial wave beams allowing the low-wavenumber waves to travel through. Thus, our analytical model allows us to predict interactions between inertial waves and geostrophic shear layers not addressed by ray-based or statistical theories and conceptually understand the behaviour of the full wavefield around and inside such layers.</description>

      <title>Cross-validation of meshless Navier-Stokes solvers in porous media flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, two mesh-free CFD solvers for pore-scale fluid flow through porous media are considered, namely the Lattice Boltzmann Method with the two relaxation time collision term and the direct Navier-Stokes solver under the artificial compressibility limit. The porous media is built with a regular arrangement of spherical grains with variable radii, which allows control of the porosity. Both solvers use the same $h$-refined meshless spatial discretization to adequately capture the underlying geometry and the same Radial Basis Function (RBF) method to approximate the involved fields and partial differential operators. First, the results are compared with the data from the literature in terms of drag coefficient and permeability at different porosities achieving excellent agreement with the reported results. Next, the simulations are extended beyond the porosity range reported in the literature using proposed $h$-refined CFD solvers. The results are supported by convergence and timing analyses and discussions on meshless parameters such as stencil size and refinement settings.</description>

      <title>Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate global normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</description>
