      <title>Macroscopic boundary conditions for a fractional diffusion equation in chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine boundary effects in a fractional chemotactic equation derived from a kinetic transport model describing cell movement in response to chemical gradients (chemotaxis). Specifically, we analyze reflecting boundary conditions within a nonlocal fractional framework. Using boundary layer methods and perturbation theory, we derive first-order approximations for interior and boundary layer solutions under symmetric reflection conditions. This work provides fundamental insights into the complex interplay between fractional dynamics, chemotactic transport phenomena, and boundary interactions, opening future research in biological and physical applications involving nonlocal processes.</description>

      <title>One-sided Rellich inequalities, Regularity problem and uniform rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$, $n\geq1$, be a bounded open set satisfying the interior corkscrew condition with a uniformly $n$-rectifiable boundary but without any connectivity assumptions. We establish the estimate $$ \Vert \partial_\nu u_f \Vert_{M} \lesssim \Vert \nabla_H f \Vert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)}, \quad \mbox{for all $f\in\operatorname{Lip}(\partial\Omega)$} $$ where $u_f$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem with boundary data $f$, $\partial_\nu u_f$ is the normal derivative of $u_f$ at the boundary in the weak sense, $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{M}$ denotes the total variation norm and $\nabla_H f$ is the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev gradient of $f$.
  Conversely, if $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ is a corkscrew domain with $n$-Ahlfors regular boundary and the previous inequality holds for solutions to the Dirichlet problem on $\Omega$, then $\partial\Omega$ must satisfy the weak-no-boxes condition introduced by David and Semmes. Hence, in the planar case, the one-sided Rellich inequality characterizes the uniform rectifiability of $\partial\Omega$.
  We also show solvability of the regularity problem in weak $L^1$ for bounded corkscrew domains with a uniformly $n$-rectifiable boundary, that is $$\Vert N(\nabla u_f) \Vert_{L^{1,\infty}(\partial\Omega)} \lesssim \Vert \nabla_H f\Vert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)},\quad \mbox{for all $f\in\operatorname{Lip}(\partial\Omega)$}$$ where $N$ is the nontangential maximal operator. As an application of our results, we prove that for general elliptic operators, the solvability of the Dirichlet problem does not imply the solvability of the regularity problem.</description>

      <title>Some progress in global existence of solutions to a higher-dimensional chemotaxis system modelling Alopecia Areata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with different logistic damping effects on the global existence in a chemotaxis system \begin{equation*} \left\{\aligned
  &amp; u_{t}=\Delta u-\chi_{1}\nabla\cdot(u\nabla w)+w-\mu_{1}u^{r_{1}},&amp;&amp;x\in\Omega,t&gt;0,
  &amp; v_{t}=\Delta v-\chi_{2}\nabla\cdot(v\nabla w)+w+ruv-\mu_{2}v^{r_{2}},&amp;&amp;x\in\Omega,t&gt;0,
  &amp; w_{t}=\Delta w+u+v-w,&amp;&amp;x\in\Omega,t&gt;0,\\ \endaligned\right. \end{equation*} which was initially proposed by Dobreva \emph{et al.} (\cite{DP2020}) to describe the dynamics of hair loss in Alopecia Areata form. Here, $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^{N}$ $(N\geq3)$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, and the parameters fulfill $\chi_{i}&gt;0$, $\mu_{i}&gt;0$, $r_{i}\geq2$ $(i=1,2)$ and $r&gt;0$. It is proved that if $r_{1}=r_{2}=2$ and $\min\{\mu_{1},\mu_{1}\}&gt;\mu^{\star}$ or $r_{i}&gt;2$ $(i=1,2)$, the Neumann type initial-boundary value problem admits a unique classical solution which is globally bounded in $\Omega\times(0,\infty)$ for all sufficiently smooth initial data. The lower bound $\mu^{\ast}=\frac{2(N-2)_{+}}{N}C_{\frac{N}{2}+1}^{\frac{1}{\frac{N}{2}+1}}\max\{\chi_{1},\chi_{2}\}+\left[(\frac{2}{N})^{\frac{2}{N+2}}\frac{N}{N+2}\right]r$, where $C_{\frac{N}{2}+1}$ is a positive constant corresponding to the maximal Sobolev regularity. Furthermore, the basic assumption $\mu_{i}&gt;0$ $(i=1,2)$ can ensure the global existence of a weak solution. Notably, our findings not only first provide new insights into the weak solution theory of this system but also offer some novel quantized impact of the (generalized) logistic source on preventing blow-ups.</description>

      <title>The Obstacle Problem Arising from the American Chooser Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated with the American chooser option. The obstacle is given by the maximum of an American call option and an American put option, which, in turn, can be expressed as the maximum of the solutions to the corresponding obstacle problems. This structure makes the obstacle problem particularly challenging and non-trivial. Using theoretical analysis, we overcome these difficulties and establish the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the monotonicity and smoothness of the free boundary arising from the obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of non-equilibrium steady states of a weakly non-linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equation in a domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a weakly non-linear Fokker-Planck equation with BGK heat thermostats in a spatially bounded domain with conservative Maxwell boundary conditions, presenting a space-dependent accommodation coefficient and a space-dependent temperature on the spatial boundary. The model is based from a problem introduced in [E. A. Carlen, R. Esposito, J. L. Lebowitz, R. Marra, and C. Mouhot. Approach to the steady state in kinetic models with thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. J. Stat. Phys., 172(2):522--543, 2018] where the authors studied the properties of the non-equilibrium steady states for non-linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with BGK thermostats in the torus. We generalize those results for bounded domains using the recent results presented in [K. Carrapatoso, P. Gabriel, R. Medina, and S. Mischler. Constructive krein-rutman result for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in a domain, 2024] for the study of general kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with Maxwell boundary conditions. More precisely, in a weakly non-linear regime, we obtain the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state and its stability in the perturbative regime. .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum field theory for a scalar model of the electromagnetic field interacting with a system of two-level atoms. In this setting, we show that it is possible to uniquely determine the density of atoms from measurements of the source to solution map for a system of nonlocal partial differential equations, which describe the scattering of a two-photon state from the atoms. The required measurements involve correlating the outputs of a point detector with an integrating detector, thereby providing information about the entanglement of the photons.</description>

      <title>Adaptation in shifting and size-changing environments under selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model to characterize how a diffusing population adapts under a time periodic selection, while its environment undergoes shifts and size changes, leading to significant differences with classical results on fixed domains. After studying the underlying periodic parabolic principal eigenelements, we address the extinction vs. persistence issue, taking into account the interplay between the moving habitat and periodic selection. Subsequently, we employ a space-time finite element approach, establish the well-posedness of the approximation scheme, and conduct numerical simulations to explore these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transition threshold of Couette flow for 2D Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the stability threshold of $\alpha\leq \frac13$ for 2D Boussinesq equations around the Couette flow in $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}$ with Richardson number $\gamma^2&gt;\frac14$ and different viscosity $\nu$ and thermal diffusivity $\mu$. More precisely, if $\|v_{in}-(y,0)\|_{H^{s+1/2}}+ \|\rho_{in}+\gamma^2 y-1\|_{H^{s+1/2}}\leq c(\min\{\nu,\mu\})^{1/3}$, $\frac{\nu+\mu}{2\gamma\sqrt{\nu \mu} }&lt; 2-\varepsilon$, $s&gt;3/2$, then the asymptotic stability holds. This stability threshold is consistent with the optimal stability threshold for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations in Sobolev space. And in the sense of inviscid damping effect, the regularity assumption of the initial data should be sharp.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model for polyatomic gas with quasi-resonant collisions leading to bi-temperature relaxation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the Boltzmann framework for polyatomic gases by introducing quasi-resonant kernels, which relax resonant interactions, for which kinetic and internal energies are separately conserved and lead to equilibrium states with two temperatures. We establish an H-theorem and analyze the quasi-resonant model's asymptotic behaviour, demonstrating a two-phase relaxation process: an initial convergence towards a two-temperature Maxwellian state followed by gradual relaxation of the two temperatures towards each other. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical predictions. The notion of quasi-resonance provides the first rigorous framework of a Boltzmann dynamics for which the distribution is at all times close to a multi-temperature Maxwellian, relaxing towards a one-temperature Maxwellian.</description>

We deduce this result as a consequence of a more general theorem valid for quasiregular gradient mappings.</description>

      <title>Finite-time self-similar implosion of hollow vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the finite-time blowup of hollow vortices. These are solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equations for which the fluid domain is the complement of finitely many Jordan curves $\Gamma_1, \ldots, \Gamma_M$, and such that the flow is irrotational and incompressible, but with a nonzero circulation around each boundary component. The region bounded by $\Gamma_k$ is a ``vortex core'', modeled as a bubble of ideal gas: the pressure is constant in space and inversely proportional to the area of the vortex. This can be thought of as the isobaric approximation assuming isothermal flow.
  Our results come in two parts. There exist explicit families of purely circular rotating and imploding hollow vortices. Implosion means more precisely that the vortex core shrinks to the origin in finite time, while the absolute value of the pressure simultaneously diverges to infinity. We prove that for any $m \geq 2$, there exist near-circular $m$-fold symmetric rotating hollow vortices. By contrast, for all $m \geq 2$, the purely circular imploding vortices are locally unique among all collapsing vortices with uniform velocity at infinity.
  The second part concerns configurations of multiple hollow vortices. The existence of configurations of point vortices that collapse into a common point in finite time is classical. We prove that generically, these can be desingularized to yield families of hollow vortex configurations exhibiting self-similar finite-time implosion. Specific examples of an imploding trio and quartet of hollow vortices are given.</description>

      <title>Global convergence rates in the relaxation limits for the compressible Euler and Euler-Maxwell systems in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two relaxation problems in the class of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems: the compressible Euler system with damping and the compressible Euler-Maxwell system. In classical Sobolev spaces, we derive a global convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ between strong solutions of the relaxed Euler system and the porous medium equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq1$) for \emph{ill-prepared} initial data. In a well-prepared setting, we derive an enhanced convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ between the solutions of the compressible Euler system and their first-order asymptotic approximation. Regarding the Euler-Maxwell system, we prove the global strong convergence of its solutions to the drift-diffusion model in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. These results are achieved by developing an asymptotic expansion approach that, combined with stream function techniques, ensures uniform-in-time error estimates.</description>

      <title>Half-space Liouville-type theorems for minimal graphs with capillary boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two Liouville-type theorems for capillary minimal graph over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. First, if $u$ has linear growth, then for $n=2,3$ and for any $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, or $n\geq4$ and $\theta\in(\frac{\pi}6,\frac{5\pi}6)$, $u$ must be flat. Second, if $u$ is one-sided bounded on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, then for any $n$ and $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, $u$ must be flat. The proofs build upon gradient estimates for the mean curvature equation over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ with capillary boundary condition, which are based on carefully adapting the maximum principle to the capillary setting.</description>

Abstract: This work is devoted to the convergence of a time-discrete numerical scheme of a semi-discretization model arising from biology, consisting of a chemotaxis equation coupled with a Galerkin approximation of Navier-Stokes system driven by transport noise in a three-dimensional bounded and convex domain. We propose a semi-implicit Euler numerical scheme approximating the infinite dimensional model, for which we study the well-posedness and derive some uniform estimates for the discrete variables</description>

      <title>Frobenius theorem and fine structure of tangency sets to non-involutive distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a complete answer to the question whether Frobenius' Theorem can be generalized to surfaces below the $C^{1,1}$ threshold. We study the fine structure of the tangency set in terms of involutivity of a given distribution and we highlight a tradeoff behavior between the regularity of a tangent surface and that of the tangency set. First of all, we prove a Frobenius-type result, that is, given a $k$-dimensional surface $S$ of class $C^1$ and a non-involutive $k$-distribution $V$, if $E$ is a Borel set contained in the tangency set $\tau(S,V)$ of $S$ to $V$ and $\mathbb1_E\in W^{s,1}(S)$ with $s&gt;1/2$ then $E$ must be $\mathscr{H}^k$-null in $S$. In addition, if $S$ is locally a graph of a $C^1$ function with gradient in $W^{\alpha,q}$ and if a Borel set $E \subset \tau(S,V)$ satisfies $ \mathbb1_E\in W^{s,1}(S)$ with \[ s \in \bigl(0,\tfrac{1}{2}\bigr]\qquad\text{and}\qquad\alpha \;&gt;\; 1 - \Bigl(2 - \tfrac{1}{q}\Bigr) \, s, \] then $\mathscr{H}^k(E) = 0$. We show this exponents' condition to be sharp by constructing, for any $\alpha &lt; 1 - \bigl(2 - \tfrac{1}{q}\bigr) s$, a surface $S $ in the same class as above and a set $E \subset \tau(S,V)$ with $\mathbb1_E \in W^{s,1}(S)$ and $\mathscr{H}^k(E) &gt; 0$. Our methods combine refined fractional Sobolev estimates on rectifiable sets, a Stokes-type theorem for rough forms on finite-perimeter sets, and a generalization of the Lusin's Theorem for gradients.</description>

      <title>LQ optimal control for infinite-dimensional passive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Linear-Quadratic optimal control problem for a general class of infinite-dimensional passive systems, allowing for unbounded input and output operators. We show that under mild assumptions, the finite cost condition is always satisfied. Moreover, we show that the optimal cost operator is a contraction. In the case where the system is energy preserving, the optimal cost operator is shown to be the identity, which allows to deduce easily the unique stabilizing optimal control. In this case, we derive an explicit solution to an adapted operator Riccati equation. We apply our results to boundary control systems, first-order port-Hamiltonian systems and an Euler-Bernoulli beam with shear force control.</description>

Abstract: Transversally K\"ahler foliations are a generalisation of K\"ahler manifolds, appearing naturally in the complex non-K\"ahler setting. We give a self-contained proof of how the classical methods used in the proof of the Aubin-Yau theorem adapt to the transversally K\"ahler case under the homological orientability condition. We apply this result to obtain a new, simpler proof of the already known Vaisman Aubin-Yau theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heat semigroups of the form $\exp(t(\Delta - \lambda\mathbf{1}_{\Omega_0}))$ on bounded domains. These singularly perturbed equations arise in certain models of diffusion limited chemical reactions. Using variants of Moser iteration, we show sub-exponential decay in the ``large coupling limit", i.e. as $\lambda\nearrow\infty$, in compact subdomains of the ``obstacle", $\Omega_0$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional signal-dependent parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system and its mean-field derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness of two-dimensional signal-dependent Keller-Segel system and its mean-field derivation from a interacting particle system on the whole space are investigated. The signal dependence effect is reflected by the fact that the diffusion coefficient in the particle system depends non-linearly on the interactions between the individuals. Therefore, the mathematical challenge in studying the well-posedness of this system lies in the possible degeneracy and the aggregation effect when the concentration of signal becomes unbounded. The well-established method on bounded domains, to obtain the appropriate estimates for the signal concentration, is invalid for the whole space case. Motivated by the entropy minimization method and Onofri's inequality, which has been successfully applied for the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, we establish a complete entropy estimate benefited from the linear diffusion term, which plays an important role in obtaining the L^p estimates for the solution. Furthermore, the upper bound for the concentration of signal is obtained. Based on the estimates we obtained for the density of bacteria, the rigorous mean-field derivation is proved by introducing an intermediate particle system with a mollified interaction potential with logarithmic scaling. By using this mollification, we obtain the convergence of the particle trajectories in expectation, which implies the weak propagation of chaos. Additionally, under a regularity assumption of the initial data, we infer higher regularity for the solutions, which allows us to use the relative entropy method to derive the strong L^1 convergence for the propagation of chaos.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 2. 1-D Ohmic Contact Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of the steady-state for a 1-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with Ohmic contact boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We utilize Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to ensure the global existence of solutions around the steady state. In contrast to the deterministic case, the presence of stochastic forces lead to the lack of temporal derivatives of momentum, posing challenges for energy estimates. Furthermore, Ohmic contact boundary conditions pose greater challenges for energy estimates compared to systems with insulating boundary conditions. To address this issue, we establish asymptotic stability concerning the spatial derivatives through weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from that of the deterministic case. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure based on the a priori energy estimates. This invariant measure precisely corresponds to the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, due to the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of degenerate parabolic and elliptic equations in divergence form in the upper half space $\{x_d&gt;0\}$. The leading coefficients are of the form $x_d^2a_{ij}$, where $a_{ij}$ are bounded, uniformly elliptic, and measurable in $(t,x_d)$ except $a_{dd}$, which is measurable in $t$ or $x_d$. Additionally, they have small bounded mean oscillations in the other spatial variables. We obtain the well-posedness and regularity of solutions in weighted mixed-norm Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the vectorial stationary Schr{\"o}dinger equation -$\Delta$u + a U + b u = F, with a saturated nonlinearity U = u/|u| and with some complex coefficients (a, b) $\in$ C 2 . Besides the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, we prove the compactness of the support of the solution, under suitable conditions on (a, b) and even when the source in the right hand side F (x) is not vanishing for large values of |x|. The proof of the compactness of the support uses a local energy method, given the impossibility of applying the maximum principle. We also consider the associate Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson system when coupling with a simple magnetic field. Among other consequences, our results give a rigorous proof of the existence of ''solitons with compact support'' claimed, without any proof, by several previous authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlinear, spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equations of BGK-type with density dependent collision rates. These equations share the same superlinearity as the Boltzmann equation, and fall into the class of run and tumble equations appearing in mathematical biology. We prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed, and the solutions propagate Maxwellian bounds over time. Moreover, we show that the solutions approach to equilibrium with an exponential rate, known as a hypocoercivity result. Lastly, we derive a class of nonlinear diffusion equations as the hydrodynamic limit of the kinetic equations in the diffusive scaling, employing both hypocoercivity and relative entropy methods. The limit equations cover a wide range of nonlinear diffusion equations including both the porous medium and the fast diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and leapfrogging phenomena of multiple helical vortices for 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of multiple interacted helical vortices without swirl for the incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Assuming that the initial helical symmetric vorticity is concentrated within an $\ep$ neighborhood of $N$ distinct helices with vanishing mutual distance of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|})$, and each vortex core possesses a vorticity mass of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|^2})$, we show that as $\ep\to 0$, the motion of the helical vortices converges to a dynamical system for positive times. Notably, in the case of two interacting helical vortices with initial mutual separation $ \frac{\rho_0}{|\ln \ep|}$, by selecting sufficiently small $\rho_0$, our analysis extends to longer timescales encompassing several periods. This result provides the first mathematical justification for the phenomena in numerical observation termed "leapfrogging of Kelvin waves" reported in e.g. [N. Hietala et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2016].</description>

Abstract: We establish $L^2$ boundedness of all "nice" parabolic singular integrals on "Good Parabolic Graphs", aka {\em regular} Lip(1,1/2) graphs. The novelty here is that we include non-homogeneous kernels, which are relevant to the theory of parabolic uniform rectifiability. Previously, the third named author had treated the case of homogeneous kernels. The present proof combines the methods of that work (which in turn was based on methods described in Christ's CBMS lecture notes), with the techniques of Coifman-David-Meyer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banach famously related the smoothness of a function to the size of its level sets. More precisely, he showed that a continuous function is of bounded variation exactly when its "indicatrix" is integrable. In a similar vein, we connect the smoothness of the function -- measured now by its integral modulus of continuity -- to the structure of its superlevel sets. Our approach ultimately reduces to a continuum incidence problem for quantifying the regularity of open sets. The pay off is a refinement of Banach's original theorem and an answer to a question of Garsia--Sawyer.</description>

Abstract: We consider a damped/driven cubic NLS equation on a torus under the limit when first the amplitude of solutions goes to zero and then the period of the torus goes to infinity. We suggest another proof of the kinetic approximation for the energy spectrum under a subcritical scaling, extending to the exact solutions result obtained in [Dymov, Kuksin, Maiocchi, Vladuts '2023] for quasisolutions which were defined as the second order truncations of decompositions for the solutions in amplitude. The proof does not involve Feynman diagrams, instead relying on a robust inductive analysis of cumulants.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>
