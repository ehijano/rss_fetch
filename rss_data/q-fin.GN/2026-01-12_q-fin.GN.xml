      <title>Geopolitical and Institutional Constraints on Adaptive Market Efficiency -- A Feasibility Diagnostic for Robust Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a structural framework for characterizing the informational feasibility of financial markets under heterogeneous institutional and geopolitical conditions. Departing from the assumption of uniform and time-invariant market efficiency, adaptive efficiency is conceptualized as a localized and state-dependent property emerging from the interaction between economic scale, institutional enforcement, and geopolitical embedding. To operationalize this perspective, the paper introduces the Geopolitical-Adaptive Efficiency Ratio (GAER), a descriptive cross-sectional indicator measuring the concentration of adaptive-efficiency-supporting mass within institutionally and geopolitically central assets. GAER is not a return-predictive signal, factor, or regime classifier. Instead, it functions as a diagnostic boundary condition, delimiting the domain in which ranking-based and robustness-oriented portfolio construction methods are plausibly applicable. The framework integrates insights from adaptive market theory, institutional economics, and political economy, linking disclosure continuity, liquidity provision, and enforcement credibility to the persistence of informational signals in asset prices. GAER is formalized, its theoretical properties are discussed, and its interpretation is illustrated using a global equity snapshot based on publicly observable information. The contribution separates informational feasibility from portfolio construction and execution, providing a conceptual foundation for constraint-aware financial modeling without reliance on forecast-driven assumptions or parametric optimization.</description>

      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>
