      <title>Data mining method of single-cell omics data to evaluate a pure tissue environmental effect on gene expression level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While single-cell RNA-seq enables the investigation of the celltype effect on the transcriptome, the pure tissue environmental effect has not been well investigated. The bias in the combination of tissue and celltype in the body made it difficult to evaluate the effect of pure tissue environment by omics data mining. It is important to prevent statistical confounding among discrete variables such as celltype, tissue, and other categorical variables when evaluating the effects of these variables. We propose a novel method to enumerate suitable analysis units of variables for estimating the effects of tissue environment by extending the maximal biclique enumeration problem for bipartite graphs to $k$-partite hypergraphs. We applied the proposed method to a large mouse single-cell transcriptome dataset of Tabala Muris Senis to evaluate pure tissue environmental effects on gene expression. Data Mining using the proposed method revealed pure tissue environment effects on gene expression and its age-related change among adipose sub-tissues. The method proposed in this study helps evaluations of the effects of discrete variables in exploratory data mining of large-scale genomics datasets.</description>

      <title>pVACview: an interactive visualization tool for efficient neoantigen prioritization and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neoantigen targeting therapies including personalized vaccines have shown promise in the treatment of cancers. Accurate identification/prioritization of neoantigens is highly relevant to designing clinical trials, predicting treatment response, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing technologies, it is now possible to predict neoantigens based on patient-specific variant information. However, numerous factors must be considered when prioritizing neoantigens for use in personalized therapies. Complexities such as alternative transcript annotations, various binding, presentation and immunogenicity prediction algorithms, and variable peptide lengths/registers all potentially impact the neoantigen selection process. While computational tools generate numerous algorithmic predictions for neoantigen characterization, results from these pipelines are difficult to navigate and require extensive knowledge of the underlying tools for accurate interpretation. Due to the intricate nature and number of salient neoantigen features, presenting all relevant information to facilitate candidate selection for downstream applications is a difficult challenge that current tools fail to address. We have created pVACview, the first interactive tool designed to aid in the prioritization and selection of neoantigen candidates for personalized neoantigen therapies. pVACview has a user-friendly and intuitive interface where users can upload, explore, select and export their neoantigen candidates. The tool allows users to visualize candidates using variant, transcript and peptide information. pVACview will allow researchers to analyze and prioritize neoantigen candidates with greater efficiency and accuracy in basic and translational settings. The application is available as part of the pVACtools pipeline at pvactools.org and as an online server at pvacview.org.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gene Selection in Single-Cell Genomics: Pre-Filtering Synergy and Reinforced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in single-cell genomics necessitate precision in gene panel selection to interpret complex biological data effectively. Those methods aim to streamline the analysis of scRNA-seq data by focusing on the most informative genes that contribute significantly to the specific analysis task. Traditional selection methods, which often rely on expert domain knowledge, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, are prone to biases and inefficiencies that may obscure critical genomic signals. Recognizing the limitations of traditional methods, we aim to transcend these constraints with a refined strategy. In this study, we introduce an iterative gene panel selection strategy that is applicable to clustering tasks in single-cell genomics. Our method uniquely integrates results from other gene selection algorithms, providing valuable preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge as initial guides in the search space to enhance the efficiency of our framework. Furthermore, we incorporate the stochastic nature of the exploration process in reinforcement learning (RL) and its capability for continuous optimization through reward-based feedback. This combination mitigates the biases inherent in the initial boundaries and harnesses RL's adaptability to refine and target gene panel selection dynamically. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted detailed comparative experiments, case studies, and visualization analysis.</description>

      <title>LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, has become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce $\textbf{LangCell}$, the first $\textbf{Lang}$uage-$\textbf{Cell}$ pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.</description>
