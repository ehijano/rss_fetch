      <title>High-energy eigenfunctions of point perturbations of the Laplacian on the spheres $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of Quantum Limits, and more generally, of semiclassical measures of sequences of eigenfunctions of perturbations of the Laplacian on the spheres $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{3}$ by point-scatterers. In the unperturbed case, it is known that the set of semiclassical measures coincides with the set of measures that are invariant under the geodesic flow; on the other hand, when the Laplacian is perturbed by a generic smooth potential, the set of semiclassical measures turns out to be strictly contained within that of invariant measures. In this article, we prove that the addition of a perturbation by a finite set of point-scatterers has a different effect: (i) all invariant measures are semiclassical measures for some sequence of eigenstates of the perturbed operator, and (ii) as soon as the set of scatterers contains a pair of antipodal points, it is possible to construct a sequence of eigenfunctions whose semiclassical measure is not invariant under the geodesic flow. We also show that this geometric condition is sharp: if the set of scatterers does not contain a pair of antipodal points, then the sets of invariant and semiclassical measures coincide.</description>

      <title>High-energy eigenfunctions of point perturbations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the high-frequency properties of eigenfunctions of point perturbations of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold. More specifically, we are interested in understanding to what extent the high-frequency behavior of eigenfunctions depends on the global dynamics of the geodesic flow in the manifold, as is the case when smooth perturbations are present. Our main result proves that as soon as the Laplacian is perturbed by a finite family of Dirac masses placed at points whose set of looping directions has zero measure, semiclassical measures corresponding to high-frequency sequences of eigenfunctions are supported on the unit cosphere bundle and invariant under the geodesic flow. The main difficulty in establishing this result relies on the fact that point perturbations are unbounded operators that cannot be written as pseudodifferential operators, and therefore, the corresponding perturbed Laplacian does not have an unambiguously defined classical flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Response of a Finite Circular Plate on an Elastic Half-Space Using the Truncated Lamb Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an exact operator formulation for the dynamic interaction between a finite circular elastic plate and an elastic half-space. Classical analyses, beginning with Lamb's representation of the half-space response, typically assume an infinite plate and rely on diagonalization of the soil operator via the continuous Hankel transform. For a plate of finite radius $R$, however, both traction and displacement are supported only on $0 \le r \le R$, leading to the spatially truncated Lamb operator \[ \mathscr{M}(\omega) = \chi_{[0,R]} \, T(\omega)\, \chi_{[0,R]}, \] where $T(\omega)$ is the Hankel multiplier involving the Rayleigh denominator $\Omega(\xi,\omega)$. Truncation destroys the diagonal structure of $T(\omega)$ and introduces real-axis singularities associated with the Rayleigh pole, in addition to square-root branch points at $\xi = k_T$ and $\xi = k_L$. We represent the action of $\mathscr{M}(\omega)$ on a finite-disk Bessel basis $\{ \phi_n(r) = A_{1,n} J_0(\lambda_n r) + A_{2,n} I_0(\lambda_n r)\},$ which satisfies the free-edge boundary conditions of the plate, and derive explicit expressions for the resulting matrix elements. These involve integrals of the Lamb kernel evaluated as Cauchy principal values, with residue contributions corresponding to radiation damping in the half-space. The resulting operator matrix is dense but spectrally convergent. Its inversion yields a complete frequency-domain solution for finite-radius plates. The analysis reproduces Chen et al.'s finite-radius experiments for small $R$, approaches the infinite-radius limit as $R \to \infty$, and quantifies finite-radius corrections. To our knowledge, this is the first exact operator-level treatment of finite-radius plate-half-space interaction that retains the full nonlocal Lamb kernel.</description>

      <title>Rotationally symmetric critical metrics for Laplace eigenvalues on tori in a conformal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the first Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue normalized by area in a conformal class on a torus. By a result of Nadirashvili, El Soufi, and Ilias, critical metrics for the $k$-th normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue functional $\bar\lambda_k$ in a conformal class correspond to harmonic maps to spheres. In this paper we construct certain $\mathbb S^1$-equivariant harmonic maps $\mathbb T^2\to\mathbb S^3$. For each non-rhombic conformal class on a torus, one of these maps corresponds to a rotationally symmetric critical metric for $\bar\lambda_1$ in this conformal class with the value of $\bar\lambda_1$ being greater than that of the flat metric. This refines a recent result by Karpukhin that answers a question by El Soufi, Ilias, and Ros. Also, we are able to show that if a rotationally invariant metric on a rectangular torus is maximal for $\bar\lambda_1$ in its conformal class, then it is $\mathbb S^1$-equivariant and coincides (up to a scalar factor) with the above metric. Finally, we show that a family of minimal tori in $\mathbb S^3$ called Otsuki tori fits naturally into our family. This gives an explicit parametrization of Otsuki tori in terms of elliptic integrals.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of self-similar wave maps without symmetry in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider wave maps from $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski space into the $d$-sphere. For every $d \geq 3$, there exists an explicit self-similar solution that exhibits finite time blowup. This solution is corotational and its mode stability in the class of corotational functions is known. Recently, Weissenbacher, Koch, and the first author proved mode stability without symmetry assumptions in $d =3$. In this paper we extend this result to all $d \geq 4$. On a technical level, this is the first successful implementation of the quasi-solution method where two additional parameters are present.</description>

      <title>Quantitative FUP and spectral gap for quasi-Fuchsian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the exponent $\beta$ in the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) established by Cohen 2023, quantifying its dependence on the porosity parameter $\nu$ of the Fourier support. This quantitative version of FUP yields an explicit essential spectral gap for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from quasi-Fuchsian groups, thereby refining the result of Tao 2025. Our result extends the earlier work of Jin-Zhang 2020 to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Discrete trace formulas and holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrix of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified method to study the adjacency matrices of regular graphs (including infinite ones) using holomorphic functional calculus. By applying this calculus on a specific ellipse that contains the spectrum, we derive an expansion of $h(A)$ using non-backtracking matrices. This framework allows us to systematically obtain discrete trace formulas that link spectral theory with graph combinatorics. To show how this method works, we give new proofs for several well-known problems, such as walk counting, the Ihara-Bass formula, and solutions to the heat and Schr\"odinger equations on graphs.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of radial potentials for given Dirichlet spectra with distinct angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse spectral problem for radial Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials. First, we show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet spectra for infinitely many angular momenta~$\ell$ satisfying a M\"untz-type condition uniquely determines the potential. Next, in a neighborhood of the zero potential, we prove local uniqueness from two Dirichlet spectra associated with distinct angular momenta in the cases \((\ell_1,\ell_2) = (0,1)\) and \((0,3)\). Our approach relies on an explicit analysis of the associated singular differential equation, combined with the classical Kneser--Sommerfeld formula. These results sharpen a theorem of Carlson-Shubin~(1994) and confirm, in the linearized setting and for these configurations, a conjecture originally formulated by Rundell and Sacks~(2001).</description>
