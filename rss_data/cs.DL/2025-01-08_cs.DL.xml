      <title>Scope and limitations of library metrics for the assessment of ebook usage: COUNTER R5 and link resolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data are at the heart of electronic resource management in academic libraries. Assessing the usage data of electronic resources has become a prevalent approach to demonstrate the value of digital collections, justify library expenditures, and gain insights into how users interact with library materials. This study analyzes the usage statistics of electronic books (ebooks) generated locally by the OpenURL link resolver in an academic library, and statistics collected by platform vendors based on Release 5 of the Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resource (COUNTER R5). Three content provider platforms (Cambridge Core, EBSCOhost, and ScienceDirect) were analyzed as data sources. The COUNTER and link resolver statistics were examined to determine the degree of association between these two metrics. The Spearman correlation coefficient was moderate (rs &gt; 0.561 and &lt; 0.678) and statistically significant (p &lt; .01). This suggests that these metrics capture different aspects of the usage of ebooks in different contexts. Other factors, such as the types of access to electronic resources and the units of content delivered, were also examined. The study concludes with a discussion regarding the scope and limitations of link resolver and COUNTER R5 as library metrics for measuring the usage of ebooks.</description>

      <title>Detection of metadata manipulations: Finding sneaked references in the scholarly literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report evidence of a new set of sneaked references discovered in the scientific literature. Sneaked references are references registered in the metadata of publications without being listed in reference section or in the full text of the actual publications where they ought to be found. We document here 80,205 references sneaked in metadata of the International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT). These sneaked references are registered with Crossref and all cite -- thus benefit -- this same journal. Using this dataset, we evaluate three different methods to automatically identify sneaked references. These methods compare reference lists registered with Crossref against the full text or the reference lists extracted from PDF files. In addition, we report attempts to scale the search for sneaked references to the scholarly literature.</description>
