      <title>Numerical Attributes Learning for Cardiac Failure Diagnostic from Clinical Narratives - A LESA-CamemBERT-bio Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical records created by healthcare professionals upon patient admission are rich in details critical for diagnosis. Yet, their potential is not fully realized because of obstacles such as complex medical language, inadequate comprehension of medical numerical data by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), and the limitations imposed by small annotated training datasets. This research aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical documents across seven distinct physiological categories, employing CamemBERT-bio. Previous studies suggested that transformer-based models might not perform as well as traditional NLP models in such tasks. To enhance CamemBERT-bio's performances, we introduce two main innovations: integrating keyword embeddings into the model and adopting a number-agnostic strategy by excluding all numerical data from the text. The implementation of label embedding techniques refines the attention mechanisms, while the technique of using a `numerical-blind' dataset aims to bolster context-centric learning. Another key component of our research is determining the criticality of extracted numerical data. To achieve this, we utilized a simple approach that involves verifying if the value falls within the established standard ranges Our findings are encouraging, showing substantial improvements in the effectiveness of CamemBERT-bio, surpassing conventional methods with an F1 score of 0.89. This represents an over 20\% increase over the 0.73 $F_1$ score of traditional approaches and an over 9\% increase over the 0.82 $F_1$ score of state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for AFDM With Superimposed Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) employing a multi-chirp waveform has shown its reliability and robustness in doubly selective fading channels. In the existing embedded pilot-aided channel estimation methods, the presence of guard symbols in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain causes inevitable degradation of the spectral efficiency (SE). To improve the SE, we propose a novel AFDM channel estimation scheme by introducing the superimposed pilots in the DAFT domain. An effective pilot placement method that minimizes the channel estimation error is also developed with a rigorous proof. To mitigate the pilot-data interference, we further propose an iterative channel estimator and signal detector. Simulation results demonstrate that both channel estimation and data detection performances can be improved by the proposed scheme as the number of superimposed pilots increases.</description>

      <title>Little Pilot is Needed for Channel Estimation with Integrated Super-Resolution Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated super-resolution sensing and communication (ISSAC) is a promising technology to achieve extremely high sensing performance for critical parameters, such as the angles of the wireless channels. In this paper, we propose an ISSAC-based channel estimation method, which requires little or even no pilot, yet still achieves accurate channel state information (CSI) estimation. The key idea is to exploit the fact that subspace-based super-resolution algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) do not require a priori known pilots for accurate parameter estimation. Therefore, in the proposed method, the angles of the multi-path channel components are first estimated in a pilot-free manner while communication data symbols are sent. After that, the multi-path channel coefficients are estimated, where very little pilots are needed. The reasons are two folds. First, compared to the conventional channel estimation methods purely relying on channel training, much fewer parameters need to be estimated once the multi-path angles are accurately estimated. Besides, with angles obtained, the beamforming gain is also enjoyed when pilots are sent to estimate the channel path gains. To rigorously study the performance of the proposed method, we first consider the basic line-of-sight (LoS) channel. By analyzing the minimum mean square error (MMSE) of channel estimation and the resulting beamforming gains, we show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional methods purely based on channel training. We then extend the study to the more general multipath channels. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Edge Inference with End-to-End Multi-View Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution to accelerate edge inference via the dual use of wireless signals. However, this paradigm needs to minimize the inference error and latency under ISAC co-functionality interference, for which the existing ISAC or edge resource allocation algorithms become inefficient, as they ignore the inter-dependency between low-level ISAC designs and high-level inference services. This letter proposes an inference-oriented ISAC (IO-ISAC) scheme, which minimizes upper bounds on end-to-end inference error and latency using multi-objective optimization. The key to our approach is to derive a multi-view inference model that accounts for both the number of observations and the angles of observations, by integrating a half-voting fusion rule and an angle-aware sensing model. Simulation results show that the proposed IO-ISAC outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and latency.</description>

      <title>Robust Snapshot Radio SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic geometric connections between millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and the propagation environment can be leveraged for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 5G and beyond networks. However, estimated channel parameters that are mismatched to the utilized geometric model can cause the SLAM solution to degrade. In this paper, we propose a robust snapshot radio SLAM algorithm for mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments that can estimate the unknown user equipment (UE) state, map of the environment as well as the presence of the LoS path. The proposed method can accurately detect outliers and the LoS path, enabling robust estimation in both LoS and NLoS conditions. The proposed method is validated using 60 GHz experimental data, indicating superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Riemannian Optimization with Uncertain Target Steering Vector for Slow-Time Transmit Sequence of Cognitive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of slow-time transmit sequence endows cognitive radar with the ability to suppress strong clutter in the range-Doppler domain. However, in practice, inaccurate target velocity information or random phase error would induce uncertainty about the actual target steering vector, which would in turn severely deteriorate the the performance of the slow-time matched filter. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new optimization method for slow-time transmit sequence design. The proposed method transforms the original non-convex optimization with an uncertain target steering vector into a two-step worst-case optimization problem. For each sub-problem, we develop a corresponding trust-region Riemannian optimization algorithm. By iteratively solving the two sub-problems, a sub-optimal solution can be reached without accurate information about the target steering vector. Furthermore, the convergence property of the proposed algorithms has been analyzed and detailed proof of the convergence is given. Unlike the traditional waveform optimization method, the proposed method is designed to work with an uncertain target steering vector and therefore, is more robust in practical radar systems. Numerical simulation results in different scenarios verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing the clutter and show its advantages in terms of the output signal-to-clutter plus noise ratio (SCNR) over traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G wireless networks will integrate communication, computing, localization, and sensing capabilities while meeting the needs of high reliability and trustworthiness. In this paper, we develop similar techniques as those used by communication modules of previous generations for the sensing functionality of 6G networks. Specifically, this paper introduces the concept of extended automatic repeat request (e-ARQ) for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) networks. We focus on multi-static sensing schemes, in which the nodes receiving the reflected sensing signals provide the transmitting nodes with configurable levels of feedback about the sensing result. This technique improves the sensing quality via retransmissions using adaptive parameters. We show that our proposed e-ARQ boosts the sensing quality in terms of detection accuracy and provides a sense of adaptability for applications supported by ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Ray-Tracing Calibration from Channel Sounding Measurements in a Millimeter-Wave Industrial Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New-generation communication and sensing systems are gaining strong interest in the context of Industry 4.0 e.g., related to mapping techniques, environmental sensing, automation or hyper-vision. The radio propagation in confined, cluttered and heavily metalized factory environments is a critical challenge; thus an evaluation by accurate propagation channel models is necessary. Site-specific channel emulation can be obtained from Ray-tracing (RT); but RT validation for factory environments is still an on-going work. For this purpose, a measurement campaign was performed in a machine room with many metallic objects and machines, using a mmWave channel sounder. Wideband channel responses were collected and compared to RT simulations. The RT prediction tool was calibrated to minimize the error observed on some large scale statistics, thus reaching a very good agreement between the simulation and the measurement. Average error in received power, delay spread and azimuth spread is below 1.5 dB, 5 ns and 2{\deg} respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mobile Target Detection and Tracking in Active Sonar Array Using a Track-Before-Detect Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for detecting and tracking underwater mobile objects using active acoustic transmission of broadband chirp signals whose reflections are received by a hydrophone array. The method overcomes the problem of high false alarm rate by applying a track-before-detect ap- proach to the sequence of received reflections. A 2D time- space matrix is created for the reverberations received from each transmitted probe signal by performing delay and sum beamforming and pulse compression. The result is filtered by a 2D constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector to identify reflection patterns corresponding to potential targets. Closely spaced signals for multiple probe transmissions are combined into blobs to avoid multiple detections of a single object. A track- before-detect method using a Nearly Constant Velocity (NCV) model is employed to track multiple objects. The position and velocity is estimated by the debiased converted measurement Kalman filter. Results are analyzed for simulated scenarios and for experiments at sea, where GPS tagged gilt-head seabream fish were tracked. Compared to two benchmark schemes, the results show a favorable track continuity and accuracy that is robust to the choice of detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Learning Wireless Data Knowledge Graph for Green Intelligent Communications: Methodology and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent communications have played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks. Native artificial intelligence (AI) within green communication systems must meet stringent real-time requirements. To achieve this, deploying lightweight and resource-efficient AI models is necessary. However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and indicators during operation, only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the network AI models. Therefore, real-time intelligence of communication systems heavily relies on a small but critical set of the data that profoundly influences the performance of network AI models. These challenges underscore the need for innovative architectures and solutions. In this paper, we propose a solution, termed the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which integrates the concept of knowledge graph (KG) into the intelligent operational manipulations of mobile networks, resulting in the establishment of a wireless data KG. Leveraging the wireless data KG, we characterize the massive and complex data collected from wireless communication networks and analyze the relationships among various data fields. The obtained graph of data field relations enables the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets, tailored to specific application requirements. Consequently, this architecture not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks. To implement this architecture, we have developed a specific solution comprising a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) as well as a feature dataset generation algorithm. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</description>

Abstract: With the impressive achievements of chatGPT and Sora, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has received increasing attention. Not limited to the field of content generation, GAI is also widely used to solve the problems in wireless communication scenarios due to its powerful learning and generalization capabilities. Therefore, we discuss key applications of GAI in improving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication and networking performance in this article. Specifically, we first review the key technologies of GAI and the important roles of UAV networking. Then, we show how GAI can improve the communication, networking, and security performances of UAV systems. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework of GAI for advanced UAV networking, and then present a case study of UAV-enabled spectrum map estimation and transmission rate optimization based on the proposed framework to verify the effectiveness of GAI-enabled UAV systems. Finally, we discuss some important open directions.</description>

      <title>Decade-Bandwidth RF-Input Pseudo-Doherty Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier using Signal-Flow-Based Phase Alignment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a first-ever decade-bandwidth pseudo-Doherty load-modulated balanced amplifier (PD-LMBA), designed for emerging 4G/5G communications and multi-band operations. By revisiting the LMBA theory using the signal-flow graph, a frequency-agnostic phase-alignment condition is found that is critical for ensuring intrinsically broadband load modulation behavior. This unique design methodology enables, for the first time, the independent optimization of broadband balanced amplifier (BA, as the peaking) and control amplifier (CA, as the carrier), thus fundamentally addressing the longstanding limits imposed on the design of wideband load-modulated power amplifiers (PAs). To prove the proposed concept, an ultra-wideband RF-input PD-LMBA is designed and developed using GaN technology covering the frequency range from 0.2 to 2 GHz. Experimental results demonstrate an efficiency of 51% to 72% for peak output power and 44% to 62% for 10-dB OBO, respectively.</description>

      <title>Resilient-By-Design Framework for MIMO-OFDM Communications under Smart Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Native jamming mitigation is essential for addressing security and resilience in future 6G wireless networks. In this paper a resilient-by-design framework for effective anti-jamming in MIMO-OFDM wireless communications is introduced. A novel approach that integrates information from wireless sensing services to develop anti-jamming strategies, which do not rely on any prior information or assumptions on the adversary's concrete setup, is explored. To this end, a method that replaces conventional approaches to noise covariance estimation in anti-jamming with a surrogate covariance model is proposed, which instead incorporates sensing information on the jamming signal's directions-of-arrival (DoAs) to provide an effective approximation of the true jamming strategy. The study further focuses on integrating this novel, sensing-assisted approach into the joint optimization of beamforming, user scheduling and power allocation for a multi-user MIMO-OFDM uplink setting. Despite the NP-hard nature of this optimization problem, it can be effectively solved using an iterative water-filling approach. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-assisted jamming mitigation, the corresponding worst-case jamming strategy is investigated, which aims to minimize the total user sum-rate. Experimental simulations eventually affirm the robustness of our approach against both worst-case and barrage jamming, demonstrating its potential to address a wide range of jamming scenarios. Since such an integration of sensing-assisted information is directly implemented on the physical layer, resilience is incorporated preemptively by-design.</description>

      <title>A Calibrated and Automated Simulator for Innovations in 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of 5G deployments has created the environment for many emerging technologies to flourish. Self-driving vehicles, Augmented and Virtual Reality, and remote operations are examples of applications that leverage 5G networks' support for extremely low latency, high bandwidth, and increased throughput. However, the complex architecture of 5G hinders innovation due to the lack of accessibility to testbeds or realistic simulators with adequate 5G functionalities. Also, configuring and managing simulators are complex and time consuming. Finally, the lack of adequate representative data hinders the data-driven designs in 5G campaigns. Thus, we calibrated a system-level open-source simulator, Simu5G, following 3GPP guidelines to enable faster innovation in the 5G domain. Furthermore, we developed an API for automatic simulator configuration without knowing the underlying architectural details. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the calibrated and automated simulator by developing an ML-based anomaly detection in a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

Abstract: X-ray and electron diffraction-based microscopy use bragg peak detection and ptychography to perform 3-D imaging at an atomic resolution. Typically, these techniques are implemented using computationally complex tasks such as a Psuedo-Voigt function or solving a complex inverse problem. Recently, the use of deep neural networks has improved the existing state-of-the-art approaches. However, the design and development of the neural network models depends on time and labor intensive tuning of the model by application experts. To that end, we propose a hyperparameter (HPS) and neural architecture search (NAS) approach to automate the design and optimization of the neural network models for model size, energy consumption and throughput. We demonstrate the improved performance of the auto-tuned models when compared to the manually tuned BraggNN and PtychoNN benchmark. We study and demonstrate the importance of the exploring the search space of tunable hyperparameters in enhancing the performance of bragg peak detection and ptychographic reconstruction. Our NAS and HPS of (1) BraggNN achieves a 31.03\% improvement in bragg peak detection accuracy with a 87.57\% reduction in model size, and (2) PtychoNN achieves a 16.77\% improvement in model accuracy and a 12.82\% reduction in model size when compared to the baseline PtychoNN model. When inferred on the Orin-AGX platform, the optimized Braggnn and Ptychonn models demonstrate a 10.51\% and 9.47\% reduction in inference latency and a 44.18\% and 15.34\% reduction in energy consumption when compared to their respective baselines, when inferred in the Orin-AGX edge platform.</description>

      <title>Greedy-optimized Approach for Interbeat Interval and Heart Rate Variability Daily Monitoring using Wearable PPG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of heart rate variability (HRV) provides insights in cardiovascular health. Wearable Photoplethysmography (PPG) assures convenient measurement of HRV. PPG, however, is susceptible to motion artifacts, considerably deteriorating the accuracy in estimation. In this study, a greedy-optimized approach is proposed for attaining high accuracy of interbeat intervals (IBIs) estimation from PPG signals collected during intensive daily activities. Utilizing the fact of continuity in heartbeats, the IBI estimation is converted into the shortest path problem in a directed acyclic graph, where candidate heartbeats from motion-contaminated PPG are regarded as vertices. The approach exploits a convex penalty function to optimize weight assignment in the shortest path calculation and a greedy fusion method to strengthen the selection process of optimal IBIs. Results achieve correlation of 0.96 for IBI estimation with the improvement of 58.4% in percentage error on the single-channel PPG signal from 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Cup. It also achieves correlation of 0.98 with percentage error of 2.2% in the two-channel PPG signal. Estimated and true HRV parameters are highly correlated. The approach is further validated on the PPG-DaLiA dataset with high correlation and low percentage error for IBI and HRV estimation in two daily activities, indicating the robustness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Noncontact Respiratory Anomaly Detection Using Infrared Light-Wave Sensing</title>

Abstract: Human respiratory rate and its pattern convey essential information about the physical and psychological states of the subject. Abnormal breathing can indicate fatal health issues leading to further diagnosis and treatment. Wireless light-wave sensing (LWS) using incoherent infrared light shows promise in safe, discreet, efficient, and non-invasive human breathing monitoring without raising privacy concerns. The respiration monitoring system needs to be trained on different types of breathing patterns to identify breathing anomalies.The system must also validate the collected data as a breathing waveform, discarding any faulty data caused by external interruption, user movement, or system malfunction. To address these needs, this study simulated normal and different types of abnormal respiration using a robot that mimics human breathing patterns. Then, time-series respiration data were collected using infrared light-wave sensing technology. Three machine learning algorithms, decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, were applied to detect breathing anomalies and faulty data. Model performances were evaluated through cross-validation, assessing classification accuracy, precision and recall scores. The random forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.75% with data collected at a 0.5m distance. In general, ensemble models like random forest and XGBoost performed better than a single model in classifying the data collected at multiple distances from the light-wave sensing setup.</description>

      <title>RIS with insufficient phase shifting capability: Modeling, beamforming, and experimental validations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most research works on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) rely on idealized models of the reflection coefficients, i.e., uniform reflection amplitude for any phase and sufficient phase shifting capability. In practice however, such models are oversimplified. This paper introduces a realistic reflection coefficient model for RIS based on measurements. The reflection coefficients are modeled as discrete complex values that have non-uniform amplitudes and suffer from insufficient phase shift capability. We then propose a group-based query algorithm that takes the imperfect coefficients into consideration while calculating the reflection coefficients. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and derive the closed-form expressions to characterize the received power of an RIS-aided wireless communication system. The performance gains of the proposed algorithm are confirmed in simulations. Furthermore, we validate the proposed theoretical results by experiments with our fabricated RIS prototype systems. The simulation and measurement results match well with the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization of 1D-CNN for Non-contact Respiration Pattern Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a deep learning-based approach for time-series respiration data classification. The dataset contains regular breathing patterns as well as various forms of abnormal breathing, obtained through non-contact incoherent light-wave sensing (LWS) technology. Given the one-dimensional (1D) nature of the data, we employed a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for classification purposes. Genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the 1D-CNN architecture to maximize classification accuracy. Addressing the computational complexity associated with training the 1D-CNN across multiple generations, we implemented transfer learning from a pre-trained model. This approach significantly reduced the computational time required for training, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process. This study contributes valuable insights into the potential applications of deep learning methodologies for enhancing respiratory anomaly detection through precise and efficient respiration classification.</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Tracking Design and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology to facilitate target tracking applications. In contrast to conventional UAV-based ISAC system designs that mainly focus on estimating the target position, the target velocity estimation also needs to be considered due to its crucial impacts on link maintenance and real-time response, which requires new designs on resource allocation and tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving object and also communicates with a device attached to the object. Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme. Moreover, three interesting trade-offs on system performance resulted from the fixed elevation angle are illustrated.</description>

      <title>C-Band Lithium Niobate on Silicon Carbide SAW Resonator with Figure-of-Merit of 124 at 6.5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a C-band shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) resonator with high electromechanical coupling (keff2) of 22% and a quality factor (Q) of 565 based on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on silicon carbide (SiC) platform, featuring an excellent figure-of-merit (FoM = keff2*Q ) of 124 at 6.5 GHz, the highest FoM reported in this frequency range. The resonator frequency upscaling is achieved through wavelength ($\lambda$) reduction and the use of thin aluminum (Al) electrodes. The LN/SiC waveguide and synchronous resonator design collectively enable effective acoustic energy confinement for a high FoM, even when the normalized thickness of LN approaches a scale of 0.5$\lambda$ to 1$\lambda$. To perform a comprehensive study, we also designed and fabricated five additional resonators, expending the $\lambda$ studied ranging from 480 to 800 nm, in the same 500 nm-thick transferred Y-cut thin-film LN on SiC. The fabricated SH-SAW resonators, operating from 5 to 8 GHz, experimentally demonstrate a keff2 from 20.3% to 22.9% and a Q from 350 to 575, thereby covering the entire C-band with excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Information-Bottleneck for Goal-oriented Feature Extraction and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is an information theoretical framework to design a parsimonious and tunable feature-extraction mechanism, such that the extracted features are maximally relevant to a specific learning or inference task. Despite its theoretical value, the IB is based on a functional optimization problem that admits a closed form solution only on specific cases (e.g., Gaussian distributions), making it difficult to be applied in most applications, where it is necessary to resort to complex and approximated variational implementations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to adapt the closed-form solution of the Gaussian IB to a general task. Whichever is the inference task to be performed by a (possibly deep) neural-network, the key idea is to opportunistically design a regression sub-task, embedded in the original problem, where we can safely assume a (joint) multivariate normality between the sub-task's inputs and outputs. In this way we can exploit a fixed and pre-trained neural network to process the input data, using a tunable number of features, to trade data-size and complexity for accuracy. This approach is particularly useful every time a device needs to transmit data (or features) to a server that has to fulfil an inference task, as it provides a principled way to extract the most relevant features for the task to be executed, while looking for the best trade-off between the size of the feature vector to be transmitted, inference accuracy, and complexity. Extensive simulation results testify the effectiveness of the proposed method and encourage to further investigate this research line.</description>

Abstract: Among the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the Fifth SDG is a call for action to turn Gender Equality into a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for a better world. It includes the eradication of all types of violence against women. Within this context, the UC3M4Safety research team aims to develop Bindi. This is a cyber-physical system which includes embedded Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for user real-time monitoring towards the detection of affective states, with the ultimate goal of achieving the early detection of risk situations for women. On this basis, we make use of wearable affective computing including smart sensors, data encryption for secure and accurate collection of presumed crime evidence, as well as the remote connection to protecting agents. Towards the development of such system, the recordings of different laboratory and into-the-wild datasets are in process. These are contained within the UC3M4Safety Database. Thus, this paper presents and details the first release of WEMAC, a novel multi-modal dataset, which comprises a laboratory-based experiment for 47 women volunteers that were exposed to validated audio-visual stimuli to induce real emotions by using a virtual reality headset while physiological, speech signals and self-reports were acquired and collected. We believe this dataset will serve and assist research on multi-modal affective computing using physiological and speech information.</description>

      <title>EchoScan: Scanning Complex Indoor Geometries via Acoustic Echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of indoor space geometries is vital for constructing precise digital twins, whose broad industrial applications include navigation in unfamiliar environments and efficient evacuation planning, particularly in low-light conditions. This study introduces EchoScan, a deep neural network model that utilizes acoustic echoes to perform room geometry inference. Conventional sound-based techniques rely on estimating geometry-related room parameters such as wall position and room size, thereby limiting the diversity of inferable room geometries. Contrarily, EchoScan overcomes this limitation by directly inferring room floorplans and heights, thereby enabling it to handle rooms with arbitrary shapes, including curved walls. The key innovation of EchoScan is its ability to analyze the complex relationship between low- and high-order reflections in room impulse responses (RIRs) using a multi-aggregation module. The analysis of high-order reflections also enables it to infer complex room shapes when echoes are unobservable from the position of an audio device. Herein, EchoScan was trained and evaluated using RIRs synthesized from complex environments, including the Manhattan and Atlanta layouts, employing a practical audio device configuration compatible with commercial, off-the-shelf devices. Compared with vision-based methods, EchoScan demonstrated outstanding geometry estimation performance in rooms with various shapes.</description>

      <title>Budget Recycling Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>
