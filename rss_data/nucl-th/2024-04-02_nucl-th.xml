      <title>Multiscale physics of atomic nuclei from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding is approached near the neutron- and proton driplines, traditional shell-structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here we achieve this within a unified and non-perturbative framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range correlations which accounts for the bulk of the binding energy is included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included via symmetry projection. Our calculations accurately reproduce available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in $^{20-30}$Ne. We also reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in $^{30}$Ne, which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number $N=20$ as the key nucleus $^{28}$O is approached, and we predict that the dripline nuclei $^{32,34}$Ne are strongly deformed. By developing reduced-order-models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S-wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective-field-theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Collective Nuclear Observables From the Chiral Potential Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an uncertainty estimate of quadrupole moments and B(E2) transition rates that inform nuclear collectivity. In particular, we study the low-lying states of 6Li and 12C using the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. For a narrow standard deviation of approximately 1% on the low-energy constants which parametrize high-precision chiral potentials, we find output standard deviations in the collective observables ranging from approximately 3-6%. The results mark the first step towards a rigorous uncertainty quantification of collectivity in nuclei that aims to account for all sources of uncertainty in ab initio descriptions of challenging collective and clustering observables.</description>

      <title>Decoding rotating neutron stars: Role of the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In December 2023, the Fermi LAT Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope $(L)$ affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 solar mass, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 $M_\odot$ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars' radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of heavy cluster decay from Z=118 and 120 isotopes: A search for an empirical formula in superheavy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various decay modes in superheavy nuclei have been of significant interest among which cluster radioactivity has recently gained sizable attention. The {\alpha}-decay being a predominant decay mode in the superheavy region, the accurate determination of cluster decay half-lives is also crucial in this region as it has tremendous potential to be explored as one of the major decay channels. The usability of the Royer analytical formula [Nuclear Physics A 683 (2001) 182], which is based on the asymmetric fission model, has been investigated for the cluster and {\alpha} decay in superheavy region, by comparing it with several other (semi)empirical/analytical formulas. After fitting the formula on around 100 cluster-decay data and around 423 {\alpha}-decay data, the refitted Royer formula (RRF) is found to be very robust which is able to estimate the cluster decay and {\alpha}-decay half-lives with good accuracy. In fact, a comparison of the half-lives of both the decay modes using the same formula points towards a substantial chance of heavy cluster (Kr and Sr) decay from various isotopes of Z=118 and 120. Hence, the formula proposed in this study works fairly well for the estimation of cluster decay half-lives in superheavy regions where most empirical formulas fail to match with the half-lives from the various established theories.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quark in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic bases with hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which controls the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of pairs of anti-charm/charm quarks through the rotation of Feynman diagrams using cross symmetry for elastic scattering of charm quark with thermal partons ((anti-)quarks or gluons) in the sQGP by the exchange of the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Comparing with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the 3{\alpha} reaction rates in helium burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium burning is one of the most fundamental steps of stellar nucleosynthesis, as it describes the formation of life-determining element of carbon, while it plays a key role in the evolution of Red Giant, accreting White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars. In this work we develop a generalized statistical theory for the 3{\alpha} reaction, which is based on the use of the Imaginary Time Method, along with the semi-classical Hybrid {\alpha}-Clustering (H{\alpha}C) and Neck Model (NM) frameworks. The results compared to the methodology and data of the NACRE collaboration, following in several orders of magnitude discrepancies, especially at low temperatures. This may be crucial for the early dynamics of helium burning stars.</description>

      <title>Coordinate versus momentum cuts and effects of collective flow on critical fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition by utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our previous study [V.A. Kuznietsov et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, 044903 (2022)] by incorporating longitudinal collective flow. The scaled variance of particle number distribution inside different coordinate and momentum space acceptances is computed through ensemble averaging and found to agree with earlier results obtained using time averaging, validating the ergodic hypothesis for fluctuation observables. Presence of a sizable collective flow is found to be essential for observing large fluctuations from the critical point in momentum space acceptances. We discuss our findings in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Farside-dominant quasinuclear rainbow in refractive $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering has a long history since the first experiment by Rutherford and Chadwick in 1927 and has been studied thoroughly experimentally and theoretically. However, $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering has never been paid attention from the viewpoint of refractive scattering. I have successfully analyzed the experimental angular distributions in $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering systematically over a wide range of incident energies $E_L$=53.4 - 280 MeV using a phenomenological optical model with a deep real potential. The existence of a farside-dominant quasinuclear rainbow with no well-defined rainbow angle and no supernumerary bow in the lit side followed by the shadow, which is not a genuine rainbow but a refractive scattering from a marginally small droplet at high energies, is found for the first time in $\alpha$+$\alpha$ scattering. The refraction due to the deep potentials with an attractive core at short distances are discussed from the viewpoint of the Luneburg. The deep vs shallow problem of the potential and the nuclear rainbow scattering in inelastic channels are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of entanglement and hadronization in jet production: lessons from the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization.</description>

      <title>Reaction dynamics with qubit-efficient momentum-space mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers, which are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We consider a qubit-efficient mapping on a lattice, which can be efficiently performed using momentum-space basis states. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, focusing on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We investigate ground-state preparation, controlled time evolution and the required measurements. We examine circuit depth and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <title>A new method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group directly formulated in $d=3$ spatial dimensions with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators. We find infrared fixed points spanned throughout the entire flavor number range that are inaccessible in the $\epsilon$ expansion. Stability analyses around the fixed points show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_A(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order transition, which could become almost continuous if the axial symmetry breaking is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>A new approach for deducing rms proton radii from charge-changing reactions of neutron-rich nuclei and the reaction-target dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the charge-changing cross sections ($\sigma_{\text{cc}}$) of 24 $p$-shell nuclides on both hydrogen and carbon at about 900$A$ MeV, of which $^{8,9}$Li, $^{10\textendash12}$Be, $^{10,14,15}$B, $^{14,15,17\textendash22}$N and $^{16}$O on hydrogen and $^{8,9}$Li on carbon are for the first time. Benefiting from the data set,we found a new and robust relationship between the scaling factor of the Glauber model calculations and the separation energies of the nuclei of interest on both targets.This allows us to deduce proton radii ($R_p$) for the first time from the cross sections on hydrogen. Nearly identical $R_p$ values are deduced from both target data for the neutron-rich carbon isotopes, however, the $R_p$ from the hydrogen target is systematically smaller in the neutron-rich nitrogen isotopes.This calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Coriolis force on the electrical conductivity of quark matter: A nonrelativistic description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating quarks and hadronic systems, produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions, can experience Coriolis force and other forces due to rotational motion. Considering only the effect of Coriolis force, we have calculated the electrical conductivity for non-relativistic rotating matter using the Relaxation Time Approximation based Boltzmann transport equation. A similarity in mathematical calculations of electrical conductivity at finite rotation and finite magnetic fields is exposed, where an equivalence role between Coriolis force on massive particle's motion and Lorentz force on charged particle's motion is noticed. As the beginning level step, we consider only the Coriolis force in the non-relativistic formalism, which will be extended in the future towards the relativistic case, and to adopt other forces for a more realistic description of the rotating quark and hadronic system.</description>

      <title>Linear Boltzmann transport for jet propagation in the quark-gluon plasma: Inelastic processes and jet modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Monte Carlo model has been developed to describe jet propagation and interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A complete set of elastic scattering processes and medium-induced gluon emissions based on the higher-twist formalism are incorporated for both jet shower and medium recoil partons. It has been employed to describe experimental data on large transverse momentum hadron and jet spectra, correlation and jet substructures in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We document in detail the structure of the model and validation of the Monte Carlo implementations of the physics processes in LBT, in particular, the inelastic process of medium-induced gluon radiation. We carry out a comprehensive examination of the jet-medium interaction as implemented in LBT through energy loss and momentum broadening of a single hard parton, the energy and transverse momentum transfer from leading partons to medium-induced gluons and jet-induced medium excitation, and medium modification of reconstructed jets in a static and uniform medium. With realistic and event-by-event hydrodynamic medium in heavy-ion collisions, we compute and compare to experimental data on the jet cone-size dependence of the single inclusive jet suppression at both Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the dijet asymmetry at LHC and $\gamma$-jet correlation at RHIC. Effects of medium-induced gluon emissions and jet-induced medium excitation on jet observables are systematically examined. Rescatterings of the radiated gluons and recoil partons with the QGP are found essential to account for the enhancement of soft particle yield toward the edge of the jet cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of quantum complex systems through a potential barrier is often described with transition-state theory, also known as RRKM theory in chemistry. Here we derive the basic formula for transition-state theory based on a generic Hamiltonian as might be constructed in a configuration-interaction basis. Two reservoirs of random Hamiltonians from Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are coupled to intermediate states representing the transition states at a barrier. Under the condition that the decay of the reservoirs to open channels is large, an analytic formula for reaction rates is derived. The transition states act as independent Breit-Wigner resonances which contribute additively to the total transition probability, as is well known for electronic conductance through resonant tunneling states. It is also found that the transition probability is independent of the decay properties of the states in the second reservoir over a wide range of decay widths.</description>

      <title>Low-energy structure and $\beta$ decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei in the region of a shape phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy structure and $\beta$ decay properties of the neutron-rich even-mass nuclei near the neutron number $N=60$ that are experimentally of much interest are investigated within the framework of the nuclear density functional theory and the interacting boson-fermion-fermion model. By using the results of the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the relativistic energy density functional, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing the even-even core nuclei, the boson-fermion, and the fermion-fermion interactions are determined. The Gamow-Teller transition strengths, with the corresponding operator being constructed without introducing further phenomenological adjustment, are computed by using the wave functions of the initial and final nuclei of the $\beta$ decay. The triaxial quadrupole potential energy surfaces computed for the $N=60$ even-even isotones suggest a pronounced $\gamma$ softness. The calculated energy spectra for the even-even and odd-odd nuclei in the Rb to Cd isotopic chains exhibit an abrupt change in nuclear structure around $N=60$, as suggested experimentally. The predicted $\beta$-decay $\log{}_{10}ft$ values underestimate the measured values for the nuclei with low $Z$ and with $N \leqslant 60$, exhibit a rapid increase for $N&gt;60$, reflecting the nuclear structure evolution, and agree rather well with the measured values for those nuclei with $Z$ being not far from the proton major shell closure $Z=50$. Sensitivity of the predicted $\beta$-decay properties to the model assumptions and parameters employed in the nuclear structure calculations is discussed, specifically, by comparing results obtained based on the different choices of the underlying energy density functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have examined the hypothesis by Bijker and Iachello who asserted that 12C has an internal structure with three alpha particles arranged in a triangular shape, leading to the formation of the ground rotational band consisting of 0+, 2+, 3-, 4$^\pm$ and 5- states. Following this idea, we reconstructed the intrinsic shape of 12C using experimental electron scattering data with minimal theoretical assumption. Our sole assumption was that the observed 0+, 2+, 3-, and 4+ states share a common internal structure, forming a rotational spectrum. The reconstructed intrinsic density showed a beautiful triangular shape with three peaks implying alpha cluster formation in the ground band.</description>

      <title>Analytical structure of the binary collision integral and the ultrarelativistic limit of transport coefficients of an ideal gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the analytical properties of the binary collision integral for a gas of ultrarelativistic particles interacting via a constant cross-section. Starting from a near-equilibrium expansion over a complete basis of irreducible tensors in momentum space we compute the linearized collision matrices analytically. Using these results we then numerically compute all transport-coefficients of relativistic fluid dynamics with various power-counting schemes that are second-order in Knudsen and/or inverse Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we also exactly compute the leading-order contribution with respect to the particle mass to the coefficient of bulk viscosity, the relaxation time, and other second-order transport coefficients of the bulk viscous pressure.</description>

Abstract: Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate a high-intensity collimated beam of neutrinos in the forward (beam) direction, characterised by energies of up to several TeV. The recent observation of LHC neutrinos by FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC signals that this hitherto ignored particle beam is now available for scientific inquiry. Here we quantify the impact that neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC would have on the parton distributions (PDFs) of protons and heavy nuclei. We generate projections for DIS structure functions for FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at Run III, as well as for the FASER$\nu$2, AdvSND, and FLArE experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating concurrently with the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). We determine that up to one million electron- and muon-neutrino DIS interactions within detector acceptance can be expected by the end of the HL-LHC, covering a kinematic region in $x$ and $Q^2$ overlapping with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. Including these DIS projections into global (n)PDF analyses, specifically PDF4LHC21, NNPDF4.0, and EPPS21, reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, in particular for strangeness and the up and down valence PDFs. We show that LHC neutrino data enables improved theoretical predictions for core processes at the HL-LHC, such as Higgs and weak gauge boson production. Our analysis demonstrates that exploiting the LHC neutrino beam effectively provides CERN with a "Neutrino-Ion Collider" without requiring modifications in its accelerator infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Probing the Short-Distance Structure of the Quark-Gluon Plasma with Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-energy-correlators (EEC's) are a promising observable to study the dynamics of jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through its imprint on angular scales in the energy flux of final-state particles. We carry out the first complete calculation of EEC's using realistic simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, and dissect the different dynamics underlying the final distribution through analyses of jet propagation in a uniform medium. The EEC's of $\gamma$-jets in heavy-ion collisions are found to be enhanced by the medium response from elastic scatterings instead of induced gluon radiation at large angles. In the meantime, EEC's are suppressed at small angles due to energy loss and transverse momentum broadening of jet shower partons. These modifications are further shown to be sensitive to the angular scale of the in-medium interaction, as characterized by the Debye screening mass. Experimental verification and measurement of such modifications will shed light on this scale, and the short-distance structure of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Parallel scattering, saturation, and generalized Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli (AGK) theorem in the EPOS4 framework, with applications for heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 5.02 TeV and 200 GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions will first realize many nucleon-nucleon scatterings, happening instantaneously and therefore necessarily in parallel, due to the short collision time. An appropriate quantum mechanical tool to treat that problem is S-matrix theory, and it has been known for a long time how to derive a simple geometric probabilistic picture, still widely used, and here the Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli (AGK) theorem plays a crucial role. All this is done in a scenario where energy conservation is not taken care of, but this is needed, in particular for Monte Carlo simulations. When introducing energy-momentum sharing properly, the AGK theorem does not apply anymore, nor do simple geometric concepts such as binary scaling. I will discuss this (very serious) problem, and how it can be solved, in the EPOS4 framework. When connecting the multiple Pomeron approach (for parallel scatterings) and perturbative QCD, one is actually forced to implement in a very particular way saturation scales, in order to get an approach free of contradictions. One recovers a generalized AGK theorem (gAGK), valid at large $p_{t}$ (larger than the relevant saturation scales). I discuss how gAGK is related to factorization (in proton-proton scatterings) and binary scaling (in heavy-ion collisions). I will show some applications, using this new approach as an initial condition for hydrodynamical evolutions, for heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 5.02 TeV and 200 GeV, to get some idea about the energy dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the analysis of transverse single-spin asymmetries $A_N$ in lepton-nucleon scattering where only a single pion is detected in the final state, $\ell\,N^\uparrow\to h\, X$. This observable is the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) analogue to $A_N$ in proton-proton collisions, $p^\uparrow p\to h\,X$, that has been studied intensely for decades, especially at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We incorporate new theoretical developments in the collinear twist-3 framework and utilize recent extractions of (Sivers-like and Collins-like) quark-gluon-quark correlators in the numerical computations. We compare our calculations to HERMES measurements as well as make predictions for Jefferson Lab, COMPASS, and EIC kinematics. We further explore the role of next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the (twist-2) unpolarized cross section (denominator of $A_N$) and consider what can be deduced empirically about the potential numerical significance of the full NLO calculation of $A_N$ in this process. We consider sources of theoretical uncertainty in our predictions, which present potential opportunities then for future measurements to improve our understanding of $A_N$ and multi-parton correlations in hadrons.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic waves in strongly coupled Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propagating chiral magnetic waves (CMW) are expected to exist in chiral plasmas due to the interplay between the chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects induced by the presence of a chiral anomaly. Unfortunately, it was pointed out that, because of the effects of electric conductivity and dissipation, CMW are overdamped and therefore their signatures are unlikely to be seen in heavy-ion collision experiments and in the quark gluon plasma. Nonetheless, the chiral anomaly plays a fundamental role in Weyl semimetals and their anomalous transport properties as well. Hence, CMW could be potentially observed in topological semimetals using table-top experiments. By using a holographic model for strongly coupled Weyl semimetals, we investigate in detail the nature of CMW in presence of Coulomb interactions and axial charge relaxation and estimate whether, and in which regimes, CMW could be observed as underdamped collective excitations in topological materials.</description>
