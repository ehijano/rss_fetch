      <title>Persuasion with Ambiguous Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores whether and to what extent ambiguous communication can be beneficial to the sender in a persuasion problem, when the receiver (and possibly the sender) is ambiguity averse. We provide a concavification-like characterization of the sender's optimal ambiguous communication. The characterization highlights the necessity of using a collection of experiments that form a splitting of an obedient experiment, that is, whose recommendations are incentive compatible for the receiver. At least some of the experiments in the collection must be Pareto-ranked in the sense that both the sender and receiver agree on their payoff ranking. The existence of a binary such Pareto-ranked splitting is necessary for ambiguous communication to benefit the sender, and, if an optimal Bayesian persuasion experiment can be split in this way, this is sufficient for an ambiguity-neutral sender as well as the receiver to benefit. We show such gains are impossible when the receiver has only two actions available. Such gains persist even when the sender is ambiguity averse, as long as not too much more so than the receiver and not infinitely averse.</description>

      <title>Optimal Information Acquisition Strategies: The Case of Online Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online lending has garnered significant attention in IS literature, particularly platform lending, but direct (balance sheet) lending is increasingly critical. This paper explores optimal information acquisition strategies for direct online lenders, addressing the broader question: Should a decision-maker rely on multiple lean experiments or opt for a single grand experiment? We first examine a model where an online lender issuing unsecured loans maximizes its expected NPV at an exogenous interest rate, finding that a lean experimentation strategy is optimal. However, when the interest rate is endogenous, the choice between lean and grand experimentation depends on the demand elasticity. If elasticity is increasing or constant, the lender prefers a grand experiment, offering the same loan terms in each period. We also analyze consumer segmentation and demonstrate how higher income variability benefits the lender through more effective experimentation. In addition, we investigate hybrid information architectures that combine dynamic experimentation with traditional static models. Our results show that the hybrid architecture enhances lender profitability, offering a flexible approach that integrates sequential learning with static information. The study contributes to understanding how different information architectures affect lending strategies, experimentation, and profitability in online lending.</description>

      <title>Scoring Auctions with Coarse Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a simplicity notion in a mechanism design setting in which agents do not necessarily share a common prior. I develop a model in which agents participate in a prior-free game of (coarse) information acquisition followed by an auction. After acquiring information, the agents have uncertainty about the environment in which they play and about their opponents' higher-order beliefs. A mechanism admits a coarse beliefs equilibrium if agents can play best responses even with this uncertainty. Focusing on multidimensional scoring auctions, I fully characterize a property that allows an auction format to admit coarse beliefs equilibria. The main result classifies auctions into two sets: those in which agents learn relatively little about their setting versus those in which they must fully learn a type distribution to form equilibrium strategies. I then find a simple, primitive condition on the auction's rules to distinguish between these two classes. I then use the condition to categorize real-world scoring auctions by their strategic simplicity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Environmental Quality through Technical Change: A Free Dynamic Equilibrium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the times we live in today, humanity faces unprecedented environmental challenges. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new doors in our collective efforts to address our planet's pressing problems; however, many have doubts on the actual extent of impact that AI have on the environment. In particular, AI also assisting dirty production is a drawback that is largely absent from the literature. To investigate the impact of AI on the environment, we establish mathematical models to model the economy and the production process of goods based on outdated and advanced technologies. The secondary results are stated in the form of lemmas, the main results are stated in the form of theorems. From the theorems we conclude that AI may not on its own prevent an environmental disaster, a reason of which is its concurrent contribution to dirty production. With temporary government intervention, however, AI is able to avert an environmental disaster.</description>

      <title>Search Prominence with Costly Product Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search prominence may have a detrimental impact on a firm's profits in the presence of costly product returns. We analyze the impact of search prominence on firm profitability in a duopoly search model, considering the presence of costly product returns. Consumer match values are assumed to be independently and identically distributed across the two products. Our results show that the non-prominent firm benefits from facing consumers with relatively low match values for the prominent firm's products, thus avoiding costly returns. When return costs are sufficiently high, the prominent firm may earn lower profits than its non-prominent competitor. This outcome holds under both price exogeneity and price competition. Furthermore, the profitability advantage of prominence diminishes as return costs increase. Platforms that maximize ad revenue should consider retaining positive return cost for consumers rather than fully passing it on to firms. For e-commerce platforms, it is crucial to align product return policies with broader management objectives to optimize firm profitability.</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</description>

      <title>Packing a Knapsack with Items Owned by Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a scenario within the field of mechanism design without money where a mechanism designer is interested in selecting items with maximum total value under a knapsack constraint. The items, however, are controlled by strategic agents who aim to maximize the total value of their items in the knapsack. This is a natural setting, e.g., when agencies select projects for funding, companies select products for sale in their shops, or hospitals schedule MRI scans for the day. A mechanism governing the packing of the knapsack is strategyproof if no agent can benefit from hiding items controlled by them to the mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that are strategyproof and $\alpha$-approximate in the sense that they always approximate the maximum value of the knapsack by a factor of $\alpha \in [0,1]$. First, we give a deterministic mechanism that is $\frac{1}{3}$-approximate. For the special case where all items have unit density, we design a $\frac{1}{\phi}$-approximate mechanism where $1/\phi \approx 0.618$ is the inverse of the golden ratio. This result is tight as we show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism with a better approximation exists. We further give randomized mechanisms with approximation guarantees of $1/2$ for the general case and $2/3$ for the case of unit densities. For both cases, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve an approximation guarantee better than $1/(5\phi -7)\approx 0.917$.</description>

      <title>Simple Models and Biased Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06921v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework in which agents are constrained to use simple models to forecast economic variables and characterizes the resulting biases. It considers agents who can only entertain state-space models with no more than d states, where d measures the intertemporal complexity of a model. Agents are boundedly rational in that they can only consider models that are too simple to capture the true process, yet they use the best model among those considered. Using simple models adds persistence to forward-looking decisions and increases the comovement among them. This mechanism narrows the gap between business-cycle theory and data. In a new neoclassical synthesis model, the assumption that agents use simple models fits the data much better than the rational-expectations hypothesis. Moreover, simple models simultaneously resolve the Barro-King and forward guidance puzzles while improving the propagation of TFP shocks.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design with Endogenous Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model endogenous perception of private information in single-agent screening problems, with potential evaluation errors. The agent's evaluation of their type depends on their cognitive state: either attentive (i.e., they correctly perceive their type) or inattentive (i.e., they might misperceive their type). The mechanism's incentives structure determines the agent's cognitive state via costly investment in cognition. We derive a general representation of attention incentives, show how they vary with the mechanism's allocation rule, and define a notion of accuracy of perception. In applications we showcase how perception both shapes and is shaped by the design of mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bicriteria Multidimensional Mechanism Design with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile methodology for multidimensional mechanism design that incorporates side information about agents to generate high welfare and high revenue simultaneously. Side information sources include advice from domain experts, predictions from machine learning models, and even the mechanism designer's gut instinct. We design a tunable mechanism that integrates side information with an improved VCG-like mechanism based on weakest types, which are agent types that generate the least welfare. We show that our mechanism, when carefully tuned, generates welfare and revenue competitive with the prior-free total social surplus, and its performance decays gracefully as the side information quality decreases. We consider a number of side information formats including distribution-free predictions, predictions that express uncertainty, agent types constrained to low-dimensional subspaces of the ambient type space, and the traditional setting with known priors over agent types. In each setting we design mechanisms based on weakest types and prove performance guarantees.</description>
