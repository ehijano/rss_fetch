      <title>Artificial Intelligence-based Analysis of Change in Public Finance between US and International Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public finances are one of the fundamental mechanisms of economic governance that refer to the financial activities and decisions made by government entities to fund public services, projects, and operations through assets. In today's globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation's public debt landscape can have significant impacts on that of international finances, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the correlations between international and national markets to help investors make informed investment decisions. Therefore, by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this study utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US and International Public Finances and predict the changes in international public finances based on the changes in US public finances. With the neural network model achieving a commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is able to affirm a discernible correlation and also plot the effect of US market volatility on international markets. To further test the accuracy and significance of the model, an economic analysis was conducted that aimed to correlate the changes seen by the results of the model with historical stock market changes. This model demonstrates significant potential for investors to predict changes in international public finances based on signals from US markets, marking a significant stride in comprehending the intricacies of global public finances and the role of artificial intelligence in decoding its multifaceted patterns for practical forecasting.</description>

      <title>On the potential of quantum walks for modeling financial return distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the temporal evolution of asset prices is crucial for understanding financial markets. We explore the potential of discrete-time quantum walks to model the evolution of asset prices. Return distributions obtained from a model based on the quantum walk algorithm are compared with those obtained from classical methodologies. We focus on specific limitations of the classical models, and illustrate that the quantum walk model possesses great flexibility in overcoming these. This includes the potential to generate asymmetric return distributions with complex market tendencies and higher probabilities for extreme events than in some of the classical models. Furthermore, the temporal evolution in the quantum walk possesses the potential to provide asset price dynamics.</description>

      <title>Most claimed statistical findings in cross-sectional return predictability are likely true</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I develop simple and intuitive bounds for the false discovery rate (FDR) in cross-sectional return predictability publications. The bounds can be calculated by plugging in summary statistics from previous papers and reliably bound the FDR in simulations that closely mimic cross-predictor correlations. Most bounds find that at least 75% of findings are true. The tightest bound finds at least 91% of findings are true. Surprisingly, the estimates in Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) imply a similar FDR. I explain how Harvey et al.'s conclusion that most findings are false stems from equating "false" and "insignificant."</description>
