      <title>The Relative Information Generating Function-A Quantile Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information generating functions have been used for generating various entropy and divergence measures. In the present work, we introduce quantile based relative information generating function and study its properties. The proposed generating function provides well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The quantile based relative information generating function for residual and past lifetimes are presented. A non parametric estimator for the function is derived. A simulation study is conducted to assess performance of the estimators. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real life data.</description>

      <title>On the optimality of coin-betting for mean estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence sequences are sequences of confidence sets that adapt to incoming data while maintaining validity. Recent advances have introduced an algorithmic formulation for constructing some of the tightest confidence sequences for bounded real random variables. These approaches use a coin-betting framework, where a player sequentially bets on differences between potential mean values and observed data. This letter establishes that such coin-betting formulation is optimal among all possible algorithmic frameworks for constructing confidence sequences that build on e-variables and sequential hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>On a rank-based Azadkia-Chatterjee correlation coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azadkia and Chatterjee (Azadkia and Chatterjee, 2021) recently introduced a graph-based correlation coefficient that has garnered significant attention. The method relies on a nearest neighbor graph (NNG) constructed from the data. While appealing in many respects, NNGs typically lack the desirable property of scale invariance; that is, changing the scales of certain covariates can alter the structure of the graph. This paper addresses this limitation by employing a rank-based NNG proposed by Rosenbaum (2005) and gives necessary theoretical guarantees for the corresponding rank-based Azadkia-Chatterjee correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 &gt; \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of R\'acz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph.</description>

      <title>The Broader Landscape of Robustness in Algorithmic Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient algorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An estimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the dataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the dataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of mean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the various forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas lead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.</description>

      <title>A Trek Rule for the Lyapunov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyapunov equation is a linear matrix equation characterizing the cross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process. We show a new version of the trek rule for this equation, which links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to the entries of the steady-state covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power series expansion of the covariance matrix, though for acyclic models it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of the drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas for the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift matrix. These results illustrate notable differences between covariance models entailed by the Lyapunov equation and those entailed by linear additive noise models. To further explore differences and similarities between these two model classes, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound for the marginal variances in the acyclic case. This sheds light on the phenomenon, well known for the linear additive noise model, that the variances in the acyclic case tend to increase along a topological ordering of the variables.</description>
