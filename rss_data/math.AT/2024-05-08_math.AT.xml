      <title>Symmetries of the cyclic nerve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a systematic study of the Hochschild homology, i.e. (the geometric realization of) the cyclic nerve, of $(\infty,1)$-categories (and more generally of category-objects in an $\infty$-category), as a version of factorization homology. In order to do this, we codify $(\infty,1)$-categories in terms of quiver representations in them. By examining a universal instance of such Hochschild homology, we explicitly identify its natural symmetries, and construct a non-stable version of the cyclotomic trace map. Along the way we give a unified account of the cyclic, paracyclic, and epicyclic categories. We also prove that this gives a combinatorial description of the $n=1$ case of factorization homology as presented in [AFR18], which parametrizes $(\infty,1)$-categories by solidly 1-framed stratified spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of the commutative graph complex and the top weight cohomology of $\mathcal M_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <title>The Injective category number on continuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the notion of injective category number of a map $f\colon X\to Y$ with basic results about this numerical invariant. For instance, we explore the injective category number under pullbacks and compositions. In the case that $f$ is the quotient map $q:X\to X/\tau$, where $X$ is a normal space and $\tau:X\to X$ is a fixed-point free involution, we show that the injective category of $q$ is equal to the index of $(X,\tau)$ plus $2$.</description>

      <title>Naive homotopy theories in cartesian closed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elementary notion of homotopy can be introduced between arrows in a cartesian closed category $E$. The input is a finite-product-preserving endofunctor $\Pi_0$ with a natural transformation $p$ from the identity which is surjective on global elements. As expected, the output is a new category $E_p$ with objects the same objects as $E$.
  Further assumptions on $E$ provide a finer description of $E_p$ that relates it to the classical homotopy theory where $\Pi_0$ could be interpreted as the ``path-connected components'' functor on convenient categories of topological spaces. In particular, if $E$ is a 2-value topos the supports of which split and is furthermore assumed to be precohesive over a boolean base, then the passage from $E$ to $E_p$ is naturally described in terms of explicit homotopies -- as is the internal notion of contractible space.</description>

      <title>Tamanoi equation for orbifold Euler characteristics: revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tamanoi equation is a Macdonald type equation for the orbifold Euler characteristic and for its analogues of higher orders. It claims that the generating series of the orbifold Euler characteristics of a fixed order of analogues of the symmetric powers for a space with a finite group action can be represented as a certain unified (explicitly written) power series in the exponent equal to the orbifold Euler characteristic of the same order of the space itself. In the paper, in particular, we explain how the Tamanoi equation follows from its verification for actions of (finite) groups on the one-point space. Statements used for that are generalized to analogues of the orbifold Euler characteristic corresponding to finitely generated groups. It is shown that, for these generalizatins, the analogue of the Tamanoi equation does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>On the $K$-theory of $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit algebraic description, based on prismatic cohomology, of the algebraic K-groups of rings of the form $O_K/I$ where $K$ is a p-adic field and $I$ is a non-trivial ideal in the ring of integers $O_K$; this class includes the rings $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$ where $p$ is a prime.
  The algebraic description allows us to describe a practical algorithm to compute individual K-groups as well as to obtain several theoretical results: the vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees, the determination of the orders of the odd K-groups in high degrees, and the degree of nilpotence of $v_1$ acting on the mod $p$ syntomic cohomology of $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper re-proves these connections via an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. One of the main contributions is a re-interpretation of convexity as an extrinsic rather than intrinsic property. All the axioms and results are applicable for the familiar context of topological spaces. We also provide a recipe for making the axioms come to fruition in arbitrary categories. This creates a complete framework for an algebraic characterization of various categories such as Dynamical systems, Open games, and Fractals, which also preserves a notion of Homotopy.</description>

      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, I: Construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. Motivated by work of Calaque-Haugseng-Scheimbauer, we construct a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories parametrized by an $\infty$-category with finite limits and a functor into symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories, such that the functor admits pushforwards. This $(\infty,3)$-category contains correspondences in the base $\infty$-category equipped with local systems, which compose via a push-pull formula. We apply this general construction to provide an approximation to the $3$-category of Rozansky-Witten models whose existence was conjectured by Kapustin-Rozansky-Saulina; this approximation behaves like a "commutative" version of the conjectured $3$-category and is related to work of Stefanich on higher quasicoherent sheaves.</description>
