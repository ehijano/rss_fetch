      <title>Torsion in $p$-adic \'etale cohomology: remarks and conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a complete algebraically closed extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $\mathfrak{X}$ be a smooth formal scheme over $\mathcal{O}_C$. By the work of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze, it is known that when $\mathfrak{X}$ is proper, the length of the torsion in the integral $p$-adic \'etale cohomology of the generic fiber $\mathfrak{X}_C$ is bounded above by the length of the torsion in the crystalline cohomology of its special fiber. In this note, we focus on the non-proper case and observe that when $\mathfrak{X}$ is affine, the torsion in the integral $p$-adic \'etale cohomology of $\mathfrak{X}_C$ can even be expressed as a functor of the special fiber, unlike in the proper case. As a consequence, we show that, surprisingly, if $\mathfrak{X}$ is affine, the integral $p$-adic \'etale cohomology groups of $\mathfrak{X}_C$ have finite torsion subgroups. We discuss further applications and propose conjectures predicting the torsion in the integral $p$-adic \'etale cohomology of a broader class of rigid-analytic varieties over $C$.</description>

      <title>A Hodge--Tate decomposition with rigid analytic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth proper rigid analytic space over a complete algebraically closed field extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We establish a Hodge--Tate decomposition for $X$ with $G$-coefficients, where $G$ is any commutative locally $p$-divisible rigid group. This generalizes the Hodge--Tate decomposition of Faltings and Scholze, which is the case $G=\mathbb{G}_a$. For this, we introduce geometric analogs of the Hodge--Tate spectral sequence with general locally $p$-divisible coefficients. We prove that these spectral sequences degenerate at $E_2$. Our results apply more generally to a class of smooth families of commutative adic groups over $X$ and in the relative setting of smooth proper morphisms $X\rightarrow S$ of smooth rigid spaces. We deduce applications to analytic Brauer groups and the geometric $p$-adic Simpson correspondence.</description>

      <title>Two reconstruction theorems in permutation equivariant quantum K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first generalize the K-theoretic Ancestor-Descendant (AD) correspondence in \cite{perm7} to allow arbitrary permutative inputs. With this version of AD correspondence, we reconstruct K-theoretical descendant $g=0$ invariants, and $g=1$ invariants with point target space, from $1$-point invariants of the corresponding genus. In the appendix, we show that the graph of big $\mathcal{J}$ function also forms a Lagrangian cone in the permutation equivariant setting.</description>

      <title>Variations on Pascal's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a variety of statements that are in the spirit of the famous theorem of Pascal, often referred to as the Mystic Hexagon. We give explicit equations describing the conditions for $d+4$ points to lie on rational normal curves. A collection of problems of Pascal type are considered for quadric surfaces in $\bbP^3$. Finally we reprove, using computer algebra methods, a remarkable theorem of Richmond, Segre, and Brown, for quadrics in $\bbP^4$ containing five general lines.</description>

      <title>The Schwartz index and the residue of singularities of logarithmic foliations along a hypersurface with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex compact manifold $X$, we prove a Baum-Bott type formula for one-dimensional foliations on $X$, logarithmic along a hypersurface with isolated singularities. In this case, we show that the residues of the singularities of foliations can be given in terms of the Schwartz index. Furthermore, in this context, we proved that the Schwartz index is positive when $dim(X)$ is even, and that the GSV index is positive when $dim(X)$ is odd. We also obtained some applications in the context of the Poincar\'e's problem.</description>

      <title>Weight sensitivity in K-stability of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for a spherical Fano threefold not in the Mori-Mukai family 2-29, and a weight function associated with the action of the connected center of a Levi subgroup of its automorphism group, weighted K-polystability is equivalent to vanishing of the weighted Futaki invariant. This is surprising since unlike the case of toric Fano manifold, there exist non-product, special, equivariant test configurations. For the K\"ahler-Einstein Fano threefold 2-29, and for well-chosen torus action on the three dimensional quadric, we show that this property is false and exhibit explicit examples of weighted optimal degenerations. We then generalize this to higher-dimensional quadrics and blowups of quadrics along a codimension 2 subquadric.</description>

      <title>On fundamental forms and osculating bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define higher order fundamental forms and osculating spaces of projective algebraic varieties, using sheaves of principal parts. We show that the $m$th fundamental form can be viewed as the differential of the $(m-1)$th Gauss map, and explain why the vanishing of the $m$th fundamental form implies that the variety is contained in a general $(m-1)$th osculating space. Pointwise, the fundamental forms give linear systems on the projectivized tangent spaces. We show that, at each point, the Jacobian of the $m$th fundamental form is contained in the $(m-1)$th fundamental form. In the case of ruled varieties, we describe these linear systems. We discuss conditions for a surface to be ruled, in terms of the second fundamental form and the Fubini cubic.</description>

      <title>Weil-\'etale cohomology and the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for constructible sheaves in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety over a finite field. Given an order $R$ in a semi-simple algebra over the rationals and a constructible \'etale sheaf $F$ of $R$-modules over $X$, one can consider a natural non-commutative $L$-function associated with $F$. We prove a special value formula at negative integers for this $L$-function, expressed in terms of Weil-\'etale cohomology; this is a geometric analogue of, and implies, the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for an Artin motive and its negative twists over a global function field. It also generalizes the results of Lichtenbaum and Geisser on special values at negative integers for zeta functions of varieties, and the work of Burns--Kakde in the case of non-commutative L-functions coming from a Galois cover of varieties.</description>

      <title>The Chirotropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in particle physics have revealed deep connections between scattering amplitudes and tropical geometry. At the heart of this relationship are the chirotropical Grassmannian $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(k,n)$ and chirotropical Dressian $\text{Dr}^\chi(k,n)$, polyhedral fans built from uniform realizable chirotopes that encode the combinatorial structure of generalized Feynman diagrams. We prove that $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n) = \text{Dr}^\chi(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$, and develop algorithms to compute these objects from their rays modulo lineality. Using these algorithms, we compute all chirotropical Grassmannians $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$ across all isomorphism classes of chirotopes. We prove that each chirotopal configuration space $X^\chi(3,6)$ is diffeomorphic to a polytope with an associated canonical logarithmic differential form. Finally, we show that the equality between chirotropical Grassmannian and Dressian fails for $(k,n) = (4,8)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Open enumerative mirror symmetry for lines in the mirror quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry gives predictions for the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of a closed Calabi-Yau variety in terms of period integrals on a mirror family of Calabi-Yau varieties. We deduce an analogous mirror theorem for the open Gromov-Witten invariants of a certain Lagrangian immersion in the quintic threefold from homological mirror symmetry, assuming the existence of a negative cyclic open-closed map. The open Gromov-Witten (OGW) invariants of this immersed Lagrangian coincide with relative period integrals on the mirror quintic calculated by Walcher. The immersed Lagrangian in question supports a one-dimensional family of objects in the Fukaya category mirror to coherent sheaves supported on lines in the mirror quintic. Its OGW invariants are irrational numbers contained in a nontrivial algebraic extension of the rationals, and admit an expression similar to the Ooguri-Vafa multiple cover formula involving special values of a Dirichlet L-function. This field also arises as the invariant trace field of the hyperbolic pieces in the JSJ decomposition of the domain of the immersion. These results are consistent with predictions on the existence of hyperbolic Lagrangian submanifolds in the quintic put forward by Jockers-Morrison-Walcher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the Cotangent Bundle of Complex Hyperbolic Manifolds with Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\overline{X}$ be the toroidal compactification of a cusped complex hyperbolic manifold $X=\mathbb{B}^n/\Gamma$ with the boundary divisor $D=\overline{X}\setminus X$. The main goal of this paper is to find the positivity properties of $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ depending intrinsically on $X$. We prove that $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big) \langle -r D \rangle$ is ample for all sufficiently small rational numbers $r &gt;0$, and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ is ample modulo $D.$ Further, we conclude that if the cusps of $X$ have uniform depth greater than $4\pi$, then $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ is semi-ample and is ample modulo $D$, all subvarieties of $X$ are of general type, and every smooth subvariety $V\subset \overline{X}$ intersecting $\overline{X}$ has ample $K_{V}$. Finally, we show that the minimum volume of subvarieties of $\overline{X}$ intersecting both $X$ and $D$ tends to infinity in towers of normal covering of $X.$</description>

For an arbitrary variety $X$ of generalized Kummer type, we show that all Hodge classes in the subalgebra of the rational cohomology generated by $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$ are algebraic.</description>

      <title>Bow varieties: Stable envelopes and their 3d mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the elliptic characteristic classes known as ''stable envelopes'', which were introduced by M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove that for a rich class of holomorphic symplectic varieties$\unicode{x2013}$called Cherkis bow varieties$\unicode{x2013}$their elliptic stable envelopes exhibit a duality property inspired by mirror symmetry in $d=3$, $\mathcal N=4$ quantum field theories. A crucial step of our proof involves the process of ''resolving'' large charge branes into multiple smaller charge branes. This phenomenon turns out to be the geometric counterpart of the algebraic fusion procedure. Along the way we discover various new features in the geometry of bow varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that A. Javanpeykar's proof of Belyi's theorem for smooth complete intersections of general type in ordinary projective spaces can be generalised to smooth complete intersections of general type in generalised Grassmannians and weighted projective spaces.
  We propose an approach to the generalisation of this result to smooth complete intersections of general type in more general Mori dream spaces.</description>

      <title>Nearby cycles at infinity as a triangulated functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polynomial function $f \colon \mathbb{C}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$, it is well-known in singularity (after Thom, Pham, Verdier,...) that outside a finite subset of $\mathbb{C}$, the function is a locally trivial $C^{\infty}$-fibration. The minimal such a finite set is called the bifurcation set associated with $f$ and determing the bifurcation sets is a difficult task in singularity theory. In his thesis, Raibaut attachs to such a function a virtual invariant called $\textit{motivic nearby cycles at infinity}$. This invariant lives in the some Grothendieck ring of varieties and measures the difference between the Euler characteristics of the general fiber and a fixed fiber. In this work, we show that the motivic nearby cycles at infinity constructed by Raibaut admits a functorial version in the context of motivic homotopy theory, called the $\textit{motivic nearby cycles functors at infinity}$. The nearby cycles functors at infinity live in the world of motives and hence capture cohomological information (not just Euler characteristics) of singularities at infinity and realizes to Raibaut's construction in the world of virtual motives.</description>

      <title>Motivic p-adic tame cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a comparison functor between ($\mathbf{A}^1$-local) tame motives and ($\overline{\square}$-local) log-\'etale motives over a field $k$ of positive characteristic. This generalizes Binda--Park--{\O}stv{\ae}r's comparison for the Nisnevich topology. As a consequence, we construct an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum $H\mathbb{Z}/p^m$ representing mod $p^m$ tame motivic cohomology: the existence of this ring spectrum and the usual properties of motives imply some results on tame motivic cohomology, which were conjectured by H\"ubner--Schmidt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.00134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian double Markovian models consist of covariance matrices constrained by a pair of graphs specifying zeros simultaneously in the covariance matrix and its inverse. We study the semi-algebraic geometry of these models, in particular their dimension, smoothness and connectedness as well as algebraic and combinatorial properties.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on equivariant quantum cohomology and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Floer theory induces a filtration by ideals on equivariant quantum cohomology of symplectic manifolds equipped with a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, this gives rise to Hilbert-Poincar\'e polynomials on ordinary cohomology that depend on Floer theory. En route, the paper develops structural properties of filtrations on three versions of equivariant Floer cohomology. We obtain an explicit presentation for equivariant symplectic cohomology in the Calabi-Yau and Fano settings.</description>

      <title>On lens spaces bounding smooth 4-manifolds with $\boldsymbol{b_2=1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study which lens spaces can bound smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one under various topological conditions. Specifically, we show that there are infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, simply-connected, smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one, yet cannot bound a 4-manifold consisting of a single 0-handle and 2-handle. Additionally, we establish the existence of infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, smooth 4-manifolds with first Betti number zero and second Betti number one, but cannot bound simply-connected 4-manifolds with second Betti number one. The construction of such 4-manifolds with lens space boundaries is motivated by the study of rational homology projective planes with cyclic quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>
