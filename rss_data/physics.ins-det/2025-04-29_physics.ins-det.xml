      <title>Synchrotron light source focused X-ray detection with LGADs, AC-LGADs and TI-LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs), a type of thin silicon detector with internal gain, to X-rays of energies between 6-16~keV was characterized at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The utilized beamline at SSRL was 7-2, with a nominal beam size of 30~$\mu$m, repetition rate of 500~MHz, and with an energy dispersion $\Delta E/E$ of $10^{-4}$. Multi-channel LGADs, AC-LGADs, and TI-LGADs of different thicknesses and gain layer configurations from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) were tested. The sensors were read out with a discrete component board and digitized with a fast oscilloscope or a CAEN fast digitizer. The devices' energy response, energy resolution, and time resolution were measured as a function of X-ray energy and position. The charge collection and multiplication mechanism were simulated using TCAD Sentaurus, and the results were compared with the collected data.</description>

      <title>Generative Models for Fast Simulation of Cherenkov Detectors at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) into experimental nuclear and particle physics has driven significant progress in simulation and reconstruction workflows. However, traditional simulation frameworks such as Geant4 remain computationally intensive, especially for Cherenkov detectors, where simulating optical photon transport through complex geometries and reflective surfaces introduces a major bottleneck. To address this, we present an open, standalone fast simulation tool for Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov Light (DIRC) detectors, with a focus on the High-Performance DIRC (hpDIRC) at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our framework incorporates a suite of generative models tailored to accelerate particle identification (PID) tasks by offering a scalable, GPU-accelerated alternative to full Geant4-based simulations. Designed with accessibility in mind, our simulation package enables both DL researchers and physicists to efficiently generate high-fidelity large-scale datasets on demand, without relying on complex traditional simulation stacks. This flexibility supports the development and benchmarking of novel DL-driven PID methods. Moreover, this fast simulation pipeline represents a critical step toward enabling EIC-wide PID strategies that depend on virtually unlimited simulated samples, spanning the full acceptance of the hpDIRC.</description>

      <title>Performance Study of a Position-sensitive Plastic Scintillator Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a long time, scintillator detectors have suffered from relatively weak spatial resolution due to various influencing factors. Additionally, the high cost of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) has limited the widespread adoption of scintillator detectors as position-sensitive detectors in particle and nuclear physics experiments. In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), their excellent cost-performance ratio has led to a renewed interest in scintillator detectors in particle and nuclear physics. This project provides a detailed discussion of a detector based on scintillators coupled with SiPMs, focusing on how to improve the detector's position accuracy. By developing algorithms based on traditional optical propagation, a position resolution of mm level has been achieved. Furthermore, the introduction of a machine learning CNN algorithm has further enhanced the detector's position resolution.</description>

      <title>Neutron source-based event reconstruction algorithm in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an event reconstruction algorithm, applicable to large liquid scintillator detectors, built primarily upon neutron calibration data. We employ a likelihood method using photon detection time and charge information from individual photomultiplier tubes. Detector response tables in the likelihood function were derived from americium-carbon neutron source events, 2.2~MeV $\gamma$-ray events from cosmic-ray muon spallation neutrons, and laser calibration events. This algorithm can reconstruct the event position, energy, and also has capability to differentiate particle types for events within the energy range of reactor neutrinos. Using the detector simulation of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment as a large liquid scintillator detector example, we demonstrate that the presented reconstruction algorithm has a reconstructed position accuracy within $\pm$4~cm, and a reconstructed energy non-uniformity under 0.5\% throughout the central detector volume. The vertex resolution for positron events at 1~MeV is estimated to be around 9~cm, and the energy resolution is confirmed to be comparable to that in the JUNO official publication. Furthermore, the algorithm can eliminate 80\% (45\%) of $\alpha$-particle (fast-neutron) events while maintaining a positron event selection efficiency of approximately 99\%.</description>

      <title>Wombat, the high intensity diffractometer in operation at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wombat is the high intensity neutron diffractometer in operation at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. While primarily used as a high-speed powder diffractometer, the high-performance area detector allows both texture characterisation and single-crystal measurements. The instrument can be configured over a large range of operational parameters, which are characterised in this contribution to aid experimental planning. Wombat is particularly optimised for the study of materials in situ and in operando using the wide range of sample environment available at the centre. Over 17 years of operation, Wombat has been used to explore a broad range of materials, including: novel hydrogen-storage materials, negative-thermal-expansion materials, cryogenic minerals, piezoelectrics, high performance battery anodes and cathodes, high strength alloys, multiferroics, superconductors and novel magnetic materials. This paper will highlight the capacity of the instrument, recent comprehensive characterisation measurements, and how the instrument has been utilised by our user community to date.</description>

      <title>Relative Spectral Response Function Retrieval of Hyperspectral Instruments in Atmospheric Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, tens of satellites carry hyperspectral spectrometers. Such instruments allow decomposing the light that exits the atmosphere from its top into hundreds to thousands of contiguous spectral channels. By analysis of the light spectral distribution, and in particular the depths of selected absorption lines, researchers and meteorological agencies can retrieve the atmosphere composition and thermodynamic state. To get a global view of the Earth, several instruments are generally operated synergistically, therefore, a harmonized calibration must be achieved between them.
  To cross-calibrate two spectrometers, a common practice is to analyze an ensemble of collocated measurements, meaning acquisitions performed at the same time and under the same geometry. Nonetheless, such analysis always faces the issue of setting appropriate temporal and geometric thresholds in defining the collocations, trading off between statistics and quality. Consequently, some collocation mismatches may have a substantial impact on the cross-calibration results. Thus, the following manuscript describes in detail the inclusion of collocation errors into the mathematical description and presents an application which is designed on purpose to be robust to such errors.
  Then, the knowledge of the spectral sensitivities of each channel to the incoming light, called the spectral response functions (SRF), are key to the exploitation of the acquisitions. In that context, the authors have studied and designed a novel methodology to retrieve relative SRF between two or more spectrometers, within a single instrument or between instruments embarked on different platforms. The objective of the methodology is to characterize discrepancies of responses between flying spectrometers, track long-term evolutions and harmonize their responses with post-processing when necessary.</description>

      <title>Future perspectives for $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for charged lepton flavor violation in the muon sector stand out among the most sensitive and clean probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ experiments provide the best constraints in this field and, in the coming years, new experiments investigating the processes of $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e^+e^+e^-}$ and $\mu \to \mathrm{e}$ conversion in the nuclear field are anticipated to surpass them. However, it is essential to maintain comparable sensitivities across all these processes to fully leverage their potential and differentiate between various new physics models if a discovery occurs. In this document, we present ongoing efforts to develop a future experimental program aimed at improving the sensitivity of \megp\ searches by one order of magnitude within the next decade.</description>

      <title>The Imaging Time-of-Propagation Detector at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the construction, operation, and performance of the Time-of-Propagation detector with imaging used for the Belle II experiment running at the Super-KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. This detector is located in the central barrel region and uses Cherenkov light to provide particle identification among hadrons. The Cherenkov light is radiated in highly polished bars of synthetic fused silica (quartz) and transported to the ends of the bars via total internal reflection. One bar end is instrumented with finely segmented micro-channel-plate photomultiplier tubes to record the light, while the other end has a mirror attached to reflect the photons back to the instrumented end. Both the propagation times and hit positions of the Cherenkov photons are measured; these depend on the Cherenkov angle and together provide good discrimination among charged pions, kaons, and protons with momenta up to around 4 GeV/$c$. To date, the detector has been used to record and analyze over 400 fb$^{-1}$ of Belle II data.</description>

      <title>Fiber laser based stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy with long working distance optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a highly sensitive chemical imaging technique. However, the broader application of SRS has been limited by two key challenges: the reliance on low-noise but bulky solid-state laser sources and stringent sample requirements necessitated by high numerical aperture (NA) optics. Here, we present a fiber laser based stimulated Raman photothermal (SRP) microscope that addresses these limitations. While appreciating the portability and compactness of a noisy source, fiber laser SRP enables a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in signal to noise ratio over fiber laser SRS without balance detection. Furthermore, with the use of low NA, long working distance optics for signal collection, SRP expands the allowed sample space from millimeters to centimeters, which diversifies the sample formats to multi-well plates and thick tissues. The sensitivity and imaging depth are further amplified by using urea for both thermal enhancement and tissue clearance. Together, fiber laser SRP microscopy provides a robust, user-friendly platform for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Extending the time-over-threshold calibration of Timepix3 for spatial-resolved ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid pixel detectors have a well-established array of applications ranging from particle physics to life sciences. The small dimensions of Timepix3 as well as its relatively low energetic expenses make it an intriguing option additionally for ion detection in nuclear physics experiments, as it reveals simultaneously precise temporal, spatial and energetic properties of recorded events from nuclear reactions. Currently, a limiting factor is the electronics behavior at high input charge resulting in improper energy determination of incident heavier ions. While the low-energy per-pixel calibration of Timepix3 is normally performed with the use of photons of up to 60 keV, the characteristic linear range permits a correct extrapolation up to only 150 keV/pixel. We developed a global per-pixel energy correction method involving the use of short-ranged accelerated ions and spectroscopic alpha sources, to suitably extend the energy determination capability of Timepix3 for nuclear ion spectroscopy experiments, where spatial and temporal precision of recorded events are equally crucial. It was found that upon applying this correction, the reliable per-pixel energy range has been increased from the original 150 keV to at least 1.1 MeV, while maintaining the relative energy resolution to better than 2.5% for stopped protons of up to 1.9 MeV and better than 3.1% for alpha particles of 5.5 MeV. Furthermore, to demonstrate the spatial resolution of Timepix3 detectors with silicon sensors, we present alpha-radiography measurements from which we extract the modulation transfer function (MTF) and produce real-world biological sample images.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved $74.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $87.38\%$ on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached $67.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $68.20\%$, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving $88.10\%$ and $74.80\%$ test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.</description>
