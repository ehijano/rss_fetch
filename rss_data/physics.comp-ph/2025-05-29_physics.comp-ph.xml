      <title>Physics-Infused Reduced-Order Modeling for Analysis of Multi-Layered Hypersonic Thermal Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM) framework for efficient and accurate prediction of transient thermal behavior in multi-layered hypersonic thermal protection systems (TPS). The PIROM architecture integrates a reduced-physics backbone, based on the lumped-capacitance model (LCM), with data-driven correction dynamics formulated via a coarse-graining approach rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. While the LCM captures the dominant heat transfer mechanisms, the correction terms compensate for residual dynamics arising from higher-order non-linear interactions and heterogeneities across material layers. The proposed PIROM is benchmarked against two non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs): Operator Inference (OpInf) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). The PIROM consistently achieves errors below 1% for a wide range of extrapolative settings involving time- and space-dependent boundary conditions and temperature-varying material property perturbations. In contrast, OpInf exhibits moderate degradation, and NODE suffers substantial loss in accuracy due to its lack of embedded physics. Despite higher training costs, PIROM delivers online evaluations of two orders of magnitude faster than the full-order model. These results demonstrate that PIROM effectively reconciles the trade-offs between accuracy, generalizability, and efficiency, providing a robust framework for thermal modeling of TPS under diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Descriptor Is All You Need: Accurate Machine Learning of Nonadiabatic Coupling Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of $S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source MLatom.</description>

      <title>Revolutionising Antibacterial Warfare: Machine Learning and Molecular Dynamics Unveiling Potential Gram-Negative Bacteria Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diseases caused by bacteria have been a threat to human civilisation for centuries. Despite the availability of numerous antibacterial drugs today, bacterial diseases continue to pose life-threatening challenges. The credit for this goes to Gram-Negative bacteria, which have developed multi-drug resistant properties towards \b{eta}-lactams, chloramphenicols, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, carbapenems, and macrolide antibiotics. V arious mechanisms of bacterial defence contribute to drug resistance, with Multi-Drug Efflux Pumps and Enzymatic degradation being the major ones. An effective approach to cope with this resistance is to target and inhibit the activity of efflux pumps and esterases. Even though various Efflux Pump Inhibitors and Esterase resistant macrolide drugs have been proposed in the literature, none of them has achieved FDA approval due to several side effects. This research has provided valuable insights into the mechanism of drug resistance by RND efflux pump and Erythromycin esterase. A handful of potential efflux pump inhibitors have been predicted through machine learning and molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computerized Modeling of Electrophysiology and Pathoelectrophysiology of the Atria -- How Much Detail is Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review focuses on the computerized modeling of the electrophysiology of the human atria, emphasizing the simulation of common arrhythmias such as atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Which components of the model are necessary to accurately model arrhythmogenic tissue modifications, including remodeling, cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis, to ensure reliable simulations? The central question explored is the level of detail required for trustworthy simulations for a specific context of use. The review discusses the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting the risks of oversimplification and excessive detail. It covers various aspects of atrial modeling, from cellular to whole atria levels, including the influence of atrial geometry, fiber direction, anisotropy, and wall thickness on simulation outcomes. The article also examines the impact of different modeling approaches, such as volumetric 3D models, bilayer models, and single surface models, on the realism of simulations. In addition, it reviews the latest advances in the modeling of fibrotic tissue and the verification and validation of atrial models. The intended use of these models in planning and optimization of atrial ablation strategies is discussed, with a focus on personalized modeling for individual patients and cohort-based approaches for broader applications. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating experimental data and clinical validation to enhance the utility of computerized atrial models to improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Diverse edge states of nanoribbons and excitonic insulator states of the monolayer Ta2Ni3Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ta2Ni3Te5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide with quasi-one-dimensional electronic states, exhibits rich topological and correlated phenomena. Using first-principles calculations, we explore Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons, demonstrating tunable electronic and magnetic properties-ranging from metallic to semimetallic and semiconducting (band gaps of 29.7-60.8 meV), and from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic-controlled by edge (Ni or Ta), ribbon width, and H/F saturation. Additionally, GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations, complemented by metaGGA-based modified BSE, reveal that the Ta2Ni3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator, with an exciton binding energy exceeding its band gap. These diverse properties position Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons and monolayers as promising candidates for nanoelectronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics, motivating further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Dyn-HTE: High-temperature expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop a fully analytic algorithm to compute its expansion coefficients. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. Moreover, the analytic frequency dependence in the expansion allows for stable analytic continuation to the real-frequency dynamic structure factor. This important application is discussed in a companion letter.</description>

      <title>Performance Portable Monte Carlo Neutron Transport in MCDC via Numba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a software engineering approach that allows for portability, rapid development, and open collaboration for high-performance computing on GPUs and CPUs is a challenge. We implement a portability scheme using the Numba compiler for Python in Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC), a new neutron transport application for rapidly developing Monte Carlo. Using this scheme, we have built MC/DC as an application that can run as a pure Python, compiled CPU, or compiled GPU solver. In GPU mode, we use Numba paired with an asynchronous GPU scheduler called Harmonize to increase GPU performance. We present performance results (including weak scaling up to 256 nodes) for a time-dependent problem on both CPUs and GPUs and compare favorably to a production C++ code.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Discovering Fractional Differential Equations in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex physical systems, conventional differential equations often fall short in capturing non-local and memory effects, as they are limited to local dynamics and integer-order interactions. This study introduces a stepwise data-driven framework for discovering fractional differential equations (FDEs) directly from data. FDEs, known for their capacity to model non-local dynamics with fewer parameters than integer-order derivatives, can represent complex systems with long-range interactions. Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques. We validate the framework across various datasets, including synthetic anomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozen soils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\'{e}vy motion. Results demonstrate the framework's robustness in identifying the structure of FDEs across diverse noise levels and its capacity to capture integer-order dynamics, offering a flexible approach for modeling memory effects in complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport is developing Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC) as a portable Monte Carlo neutron transport package for rapid numerical methods exploration on CPU- and GPU-based high-performance computers. In this paper, we describe MC/DC's current event-based GPU algorithm as well as the just-in-time (JIT) compilation scheme we use to enable GPU operability on Nvidia and AMD GPUs from MC/DC's Python source. To analyze performance, we conduct runtime tests of the C5G7 k-eigenvalue benchmark problem and a continuous-energy infinite pin cell on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, AMD MI250X GPU, and the AMD MI300A APU and make comparison to a dual-socket Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapid CPU node. We found that for the multi-group C5G7 benchmark problem, we respectively see a 15$\times$, 0.7$\times$, 12$\times$ speedup on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A over 112 Intel Xeon CPU cores. For the continuous-energy infinite pin-cell benchmark, we found speedups of 5$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$ on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A, respectively, over the same CPU node.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern science emerged from reasoning over repeatedly-observed planetary motions. We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. Reference solutions for each task are provided to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>
