      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a garden or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. The growth curve is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of epidemic spread in two-layer random graphs by classical and machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main goal in this paper is to quantitatively compare the performance of classical methods to XGBoost and convolutional neural networks in a parameter estimation problem for epidemic spread. As we use flexible two-layer random graphs as the underlying network, we can also study how much the structure of the graphs in the training set and the test set can differ while to get a reasonably good estimate. In addition, we also examine whether additional information (such as the average degree of infected vertices) can help improving the results, compared to the case when we only know the time series consisting of the number of susceptible and infected individuals. Our simulation results also show which methods are most accurate in the different phases of the epidemic.</description>

      <title>Orchard: building large cancer phylogenies using stochastic combinatorial search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i.e., cancer phylogenies, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1,000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.</description>
