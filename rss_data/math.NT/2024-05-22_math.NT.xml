      <title>Sparse Admissible Sets and a Problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham asked whether any sparse enough admissible set of natural numbers can be translated into a subset of the primes. By using a greedy construction involving powers of primitive roots, we prove that there exist arbitrarily sparse admissible sets that cannot be translated into a subset of the primes, thus answering this question in the negative.</description>

      <title>Integral canonical models of exceptional Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Shimura varieties admit integral canonical models for sufficiently large primes. In the case of abelian-type Shimura varieties, this recovers work of Kisin-Kottwitz for sufficiently large primes. We also prove the existence of integral canonical models for images of period maps corresponding to geometric families. We deduce several consequences from this, including an unramified rigid analogue of Borel's extension theorem, a version of Tate semisimplicity, CM lifting theorems, and a weakened version of Tate's isogeny theorem for ordinary points.</description>

      <title>On the transcendence of some operations of infinite series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper and as an application of Roth's theorem concerning the rational approximation of algebraic numbers, we give a sufficient condition that will assure us that a sum, product and quotient of some series of positive rational terms are transcendental numbers. We recall that all the infinite series that we are going to treat are Liouville numbers. At the end this article, we establish an approximation measure of these numbers.</description>

      <title>An explicit log-free zero density estimate for the Riemann zeta-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will provide the first explicit log-free zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ of the form $N(\sigma,T)\le AT^{B(1-\sigma)}$. In particular, this estimate becomes the sharpest known explicit zero-density estimate uniformly for $\sigma\in[\alpha_0,1]$, with $0.985\le \alpha_0\le 0.992$ and $3\cdot 10^{12}&lt;T\le \exp(6.7\cdot 10^{12})$.</description>

      <title>P-adic Rankin-Selberg L-functions in universal deformation families and functional equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $p$-adic Rankin-Selberg $L$-function associated to the product of two families of modular forms, where the first is an ordinary (Hida) family, and the second an arbitrary universal-deformation family (without any ordinarity condition at $p$). This gives a function on a 4-dimensional base space - strictly larger than the ordinary eigenvariety, which is 3-dimensional in this case. We prove our $p$-adic $L$-function interpolates all critical values of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions for the classical specialisations of our family, and derive a functional equation for our $p$-adic $L$-function.</description>

      <title>An $L^2$-bound for the Barban-Vehov weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ the Barban--Vehov weights, defined in $(1)$. Let $X\ge z_1\ge100$ and $z_2=z_1^\tau$ for some $\tau&gt;1$. We prove that
  \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{n\le
  X}\frac{1}{n}\Bigl(\sum_{\substack{d|n}}\lambda_d\Bigr)^2
  \le
  f(\tau)\frac{\log X}{\log (z_2/z_1)},
  \end{equation*}
  for a completely determined function $f:(1,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$.
  In particular, we may take $f(2)=30$, saving more than a factor of $5$ on what was the best known result for $\tau=2$. Two related estimates are also provided for general $\tau&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>On a universal characterisation of $p$-typical Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$ and a commutative ring $R$ with unity, let $W(R)$ denote the ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors. The ring $W(R)$ is endowed with a Verschiebung operator $W(R)\xrightarrow{V}W(R)$ and a Teichm\"{u}ller map $R\xrightarrow{\langle \ \rangle}W(R)$. One of the properties satisfied by $V, \langle \ \rangle$ is that the map $R \to W(R)$ given by $x\mapsto V\langle x^p\rangle - p\langle x \rangle$ is an additive map. In this paper we show that for $p\neq 2$, this property essentially characterises the functor $W$. Unlike other characterisations, this only uses the group structure on $W(R)$ and hence is suitable for generalising to the non-commutative setup. We give a conjectural characterisation of Hesselholt's functor of $p$-typical Witt vectors using a universal property for $p\neq 2$. Moreover we provide evidence for this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Jacobians of Graphs via Edges and Iwasawa Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacobian is an algebraic invariant of a graph which is often seen in analogy to the class group of a number field. In particular, there have been multiple investigations into the Iwasawa theory of graphs with the Jacobian playing the role of the class group. In this paper, we construct an Iwasawa module related to the Jacobian of a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower of connected graphs, and give examples where we use this to compute asymptotic sizes of the Jacobians in this tower.</description>

      <title>Representability of G-functions as rational functions in hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fres\'an and Jossen have given a negative answer to a question of Siegel about the representability of every $E$-function as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $E$-functions of type ${}_pF_q[\underline{a};\underline{b};\gamma x^{q-p+1}]$ with $q\geq p\geq 0$, $\gamma \in \overline{\mathbb Q}$ and rational parameters $\underline{a}, \underline{b}$. In this paper, we study, in a more general context, a similar question for $G$-functions asked by Fischler and the second author: can every $G$-function be represented as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $G$-functions of type $\mu(x)\cdot {}_pF_{p-1}[\underline{a};\underline{b};\lambda(x)]$ with $p\ge 1$, rational parameters $\underline{a},\underline{b}$ and $\mu,\lambda$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q(x)$ with  $\lambda(0)=0$? They have shown the answer to be negative under a generalization of Grothendieck's Period Conjecture and a technical assumption on the~$\lambda$'s. Using differential Galois theory, we prove that, for every $N\in \mathbb N$, there exists a $G$-function which can not be represented as a  rational function with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb C(x)}$ of solutions of linear differential equations with coefficients in $\mathbb C(x)$ and at most $N$ singularities in $\mathbb{P}^1 (\mathbb C)$. As a corollary, we deduce that not all $G$-functions can be represented as a rational function in hypergeometric series of the above mentioned type, when the $\lambda$'s are rational functions with degrees of their numerators and denominators bounded by an arbitrarily large fixed constant. This provides an unconditional negative answer to the question asked by Fischler and the second author for such~$\lambda$'s.</description>

      <title>Conditions for tractability of the weighted $L_p$-discrepancy and integration in non-homogeneous tensor product spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tractability properties of the weighted $L_p$-discrepancy. The concept of {\it weighted} discrepancy was introduced by Sloan and Wo\'{z}\-nia\-kowski in 1998 in order to prove a weighted version of the Koksma-Hlawka inequality for the error of quasi-Monte Carlo integration rules. The weights have the aim to model the influence of different coordinates of integrands on the error. A discrepancy is said to be tractable if the information complexity, i.e., the minimal number $N$ of points such that the discrepancy is less than the initial discrepancy times an error threshold $\varepsilon$, does not grow exponentially fast with the dimension. In this case there are various notions of tractabilities used in order to classify the exact rate.
  For even integer parameters $p$ there are sufficient conditions on the weights available in literature, which guarantee the one or other notion of tractability. In the present paper we prove matching sufficient conditions (upper bounds) and neccessary conditions (lower bounds) for polynomial and weak tractability for all $p \in (1, \infty)$.
  The proofs of the lower bounds are based on a general result for the information complexity of integration with positive quadrature formulas for tensor product spaces. In order to demonstrate this lower bound we consider as a second application the integration of tensor products of polynomials of degree at most 2.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'e theory via cohomology classifying stacks II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two results: first, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonn\'e module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence, we give a new proof of the isomorphism $\sigma^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base ring embed fully faithfully into the category of prismatic $F$-gauges, which extends the work of Ansch\"utz and Le Bras on prismatic Dieudonn\'e theory.</description>

      <title>A conjecture of Zagier and the value distribution of quantum modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his influential paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier developed a conjectural framework describing the behavior of certain quantum knot invariants under the action of the modular group on their arguments. More precisely, when $J_{K,0}$ denotes the colored Jones polynomial of a knot $K$, Zagier's modularity conjecture describes the asymptotics of the quotient $J_{K,0} (e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)}) / J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominators, where $\gamma \in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This problem is most accessible for the figure-eight knot $4_1$, where the colored Jones polynomial has a simple explicit expression in terms of the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. Zagier also conjectured that the function $h(x) = \log (J_{4_1,0} (e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ which is continuous at irrationals. In the present paper, we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture for all irrationals for which the sequence of partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion is unbounded. In particular, the continuity conjecture holds almost everywhere on the real line. We also establish a smooth approximation of $h$, uniform over all rationals, in accordance with the modularity conjecture. As an application, we find the limit distribution (after a suitable centering and rescaling) of $\log J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$, when $x$ ranges over all reduced rationals in $(0,1)$ with denominator at most $N$, as $N \to \infty$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Bettin and Drappeau.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Bound For Szemer\'edi's Theorem for a Complexity One Polynomial Progression over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a large prime and $P, Q \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ two linearly independent polynomials with $P(0) = Q(0) = 0$. We show that if a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ lacks a progression of the form $(x, x + P(y), x + Q(y), x + P(y) + Q(y))$, then $$|A| \le O\left(\frac{N}{\log_{(O(1))}(N)}\right)$$ where $\log_{C}(N)$ is an iterated logarithm of order $C$ (e.g., $\log_{2}(N) = \log\log(N)$). To establish this bound, we adapt Peluse's (2018) degree lowering argument to the quadratic Fourier analysis setting to obtain quantitative bounds on the true complexity of the above progression. Our method also shows that for a large class of polynomial progressions, if one can establish polynomial-type bounds on the true complexity of those progressions, then one can establish polynomial-type bounds on Szemer\'edi's theorem for that type of polynomial progression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a certain Hecke theoretic notion of family of smooth admissible representations of $GL_n(F)$, or of products of such groups, where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero. While this notion of family is rather weak a priori, we show that it implies strong rigidity properties for the Bernstein-Zelevinsky presentations of the members of such families, as well as for the variation of their epsilon factors (attached to arbitrary functorial lifts). Examples of such families come often from the theory of eigenvarieties, and in this case our results imply analyticity properties for the epsilon factors of the members of these families.</description>

Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $F=\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ be the rational function field over $\mathbb{F}_q$, the field with $q$ elements. Let $\phi$ be a Drinfeld module over $F$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ be a non-zero prime ideal of $A:=\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. Over the constant $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$, we introduce the fine Selmer group associated to the $\mathfrak{p}$-primary torsion of $\phi$. We show that it is a cofinitely generated module over $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. This proves an analogue of Iwasawa's $\mu=0$ conjecture in this setting, and provides context for the further study of the objects that have been introduced in this article.</description>

      <title>Diophantine avoidance and small-height primitive elements in ideals of number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field of degree $d$. Then every ideal $I$ in the ring of integers ${\mathcal O}_K$ contains infinitely many primitive elements, i.e. elements of degree $d$. A bound on smallest height of such an element in $I$ follows from some recent developments in the direction of a 1998 conjecture of W. Ruppert. We prove a very explicit bound like this in the case of quadratic fields. Further, we consider primitive elements in an ideal outside of a finite union of other ideals and prove a bound on the height of a smallest such element. Our main tool is a result on points of small norm in a lattice outside of an algebraic hypersurface and a finite union of sublattices of finite index, which we prove by blending two previous Diophantine avoidance results. We also obtain an avoidance result like this for lattice points in the positive orthant in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and use it to obtain a small-height totally positive primitive element in an ideal of a totally real number field outside of a finite union of other ideals. Additionally, we use our avoidance method to prove a bound on the Mahler measure of a generating non-sparse polynomial for a given number field. Finally, we produce a bound on the height of a smallest primitive generator for a principal ideal in a quadratic number field.</description>

Specifically, let $G$ be an abelian group of torsion $m$ (meaning $mg=0$ for all $g \in G$) and suppose that $A$ is a non-empty subset of $G$ with $|A+A| \leq K|A|$. Then $A$ can be covered by at most $(2K)^{O(m^3)}$ translates of a subgroup of $H \leq G$ of cardinality at most $|A|$. The argument is a variant of that used in the case $G = \mathbf{F}_2^n$ in a recent paper of the authors.</description>

      <title>Comer Schemes, Relation Algebras, and the Flexible Atom Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.11914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</description>

      <title>A $q$-analog of the Markoff injectivity conjecture holds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elements of Markoff triples are given by coefficients in certain matrix products defined by Christoffel words, and the Markoff injectivity conjecture, a long-standing open problem (also known as the uniqueness conjecture), is then equivalent to injectivity on Christoffel words. A $q$-analog of these matrix products has been proposed recently, and we prove that injectivity on Christoffel words holds for this $q$-analog. The proof is based on the evaluation at $q = \exp(i\pi/3)$. Other roots of unity provide some information on the original problem, which corresponds to the case $q=1$. We also extend the problem to arbitrary words and provide a large family of pairs of words where injectivity does not hold.</description>

      <title>Critical groups of arithmetical structures on star graphs and complete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arithmetical structure on a finite, connected graph without loops is an assignment of positive integers to the vertices that satisfies certain conditions. Associated to each of these is a finite abelian group known as its critical group. We show how to determine the critical group of an arithmetical structure on a star graph or complete graph in terms of the entries of the arithmetical structure. We use this to investigate which finite abelian groups can occur as critical groups of arithmetical structures on these graphs.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont-Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <title>Uncommon linear systems of two equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of linear equations $L$ is common over $\mathbb{F}_p$ if, as $n\to\infty$, any 2-coloring of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ gives asymptotically at least as many monochromatic solutions to $L$ as a random 2-coloring. The notion of common linear systems is analogous to that of common graphs, i.e., graphs whose monochromatic density in 2-edge-coloring of cliques is asymptotically minimized by the random coloring. Saad and Wolf initiated a systematic study on identifying common linear systems, built upon the earlier work of Cameron-Cilleruelo-Serra. When $L$ is a single equation, Fox-Pham-Zhao gave a complete characterization of common linear equations. When $L$ consists of two equations, Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison showed that irredundant $2\times 4$ linear systems are always uncommon. In this work, (1) we determine commonness of all $2\times 5$ linear systems up to a small number of cases, and (2) we show that all $2\times k$ linear systems with $k$ even and girth (minimum number of nonzero coefficients of a nonzero equation spanned by the system) $k-1$ are uncommon, answering a question of Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison.</description>
