      <title>Asymmetric Interactions Shape Survival During Population Range Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An organism that is newly introduced into an existing population has a survival probability that is dependent on both the population density of its environment and the competition it experiences with the members of that population. Expanding populations naturally form regions of high and low density, and simultaneously experience ecological interactions both internally and at the boundary of their range. For this reason, systems of expanding populations are ideal for studying the combination of density and ecological effects. Conservation ecologists have been studying the ability of an invasive species to establish for some time, attributing success to both ecological and spatial factors. Similar behaviors have been observed in spatially structured cell populations, such as those found in cancerous tumors and bacterial biofilms. In these scenarios, novel organisms may be the introduction of a new mutation or bacterial species with some form of drug resistance, leading to the possibility of treatment failure. In order to gain insight into the relationship between population density and ecological interactions, we study an expanding population of interacting wild-type cells and mutant cells. We simulate these interactions in time and study the spatially dependent probability for a mutant to survive or to take over the front of the population wave (gene surfing). Additionally, we develop a mathematical model that describes this survival probability and find agreement when the payoff for the mutant is positive (corresponding to cooperation, exploitation, or commensalism). By knowing the types of interactions, our model provides insight into the spatial distribution of survival probability. Conversely, given a spatial distribution of survival probabilities, our model provides insight into the types of interactions that were involved to generate it.</description>

      <title>Reentrant phase behavior in binary topological flocks with nonreciprocal alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a binary metric-free Vicsek model involving two species of self-propelled particles aligning with their Voronoi neighbors, focusing on a weakly nonreciprocal regime, where species $A$ aligns with both $A$ and $B$, but species $B$ does not align with either. Using agent-based simulations, we find that even with a small fraction of $B$ particles, the phase behavior of the system can be changed qualitatively, which becomes reentrant as a function of noise strength: traveling bands arise not only near the flocking transition, but also in the low-noise regime, separated in the phase diagram by a homogeneous polar liquid regime. We find that the ordered bands in the low-noise regime travel through an ordered background, in contrast to their metric counterparts. We develop a coarse-grained field theory, which can account for the reentrant phase behavior qualitatively, provided the higher-order angular modes are taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Directional Swimming of B. Subtilis Bacteria Near a Switchable Polar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of swimming bacteria depend on the properties of their habitat media. Recently it was shown that the motion of swimming bacteria dispersed directly in a non-toxic water-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal can be controlled by the director field of the liquid crystal. Here we investigate whether the macroscopic polar order of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) can be recognized by bacteria B. Subtilis swimming in a water dispersion adjacent to a glassy NF film by surface interactions alone. We show that B. Subtilis tends to move in the direction antiparallel to the spontaneous electric polarization at the NF surface. Their speed was found to be the same with or without a polar NF layer. In contrast to observation on crystal ferroelectric films, the bacteria do not get immobilized. These observations may offer a pathway to creation of polar microinserts to direct bacterial motion in-vivo.</description>

      <title>The lack of asymmetry of the Maxwell centroids, and of ocular dominance, in persons with dyslexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the existence of an asymmetry between the two Maxwell centroids at the centre of the two foveas recorded using a foveascope, leads to the ocular dominance in good readers, the lack of asymmetry in most of the observers with dyslexia leads to their non-dominance and their difficulties in reading and writing. Indeed, the lack of asymmetry between the two main roads to the brain, i.e. the two optical nerves, leads to perturbations in the brain central connectivity, namely between the two hemispheres inducing too robust interhemispheric visual connections, beyond the critical period of 7-8 years. The symmetrical mirror-connections like b-d (observed for about 60% of children with dyslexia) or the non-symmetrical connections like b-b (35%) induce confusions and duplications in observers with dyslexia but remain erasable thanks to pulsed systems (glasses, lamps, screens. . .), using Hebbian processes in primary cortex synapses. The effect is instantaneous, non-invasive and compensates the lack of asymmetry. These systems help most of the observers with dyslexia to overcome their difficulties. The orthoptists and speech therapists can acquire and improve the mechanism to help the children to catch up, and perhaps be able to use the foveascope for an early diagnosis with young children.</description>

      <title>Revealing Physical Mechanisms of Pattern Formation and Switching in Ecosystems via Nonequilibrium Landscape and Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium natural systems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, thereby exhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems such as embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However, how spatial pattern formation emerges and how the spatial pattern switches are not fully understood. Here, we developed a landscape-flux field theory via the spatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism of the pattern formation and switching. We identified the landscape and flux field as the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to the critical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-arid ecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives the switchings of spatial patterns. We uncovered how the pattern switching emerges through the optimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching. Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical and thermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering early warning signals for anticipating spatial pattern switching. Our work thus reveals physical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and, more generally, introduces a useful approach for quantifying spatial pattern switching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practical applications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>

      <title>Vertex model with internal dissipation enables sustained flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order, plays an important role in this process. Here we extend an active nematic vertex model by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, dominant in epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, which are found in many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets confined to a channel, providing a link between the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics and continuum active nematics, whose behaviour in a channel is theoretically understood and experimentally realisable. Our findings also show a simple mechanism that could account for collective cell migration correlated over distances large compared to the cell size, as observed during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Inferring nonlinear dynamics of cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>
