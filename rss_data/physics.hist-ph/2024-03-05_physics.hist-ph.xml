      <title>On the Time Orientation of Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An influential theorem by Satosi Wantabe convinced many that there can be no genuinely probabilistic theory with both non-trivial forward and backward transition probabilities. We show that this conclusion does not follow from the theorem. We point out the flaw in the argument, and we showcase examples of theories with well-defined backward and forward transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Special theory of regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of regularity is a philosophical perspective in which laws of nature are just descriptions, that is to say, laws of nature do not govern the world. Moreover, according to the theory of regularity, the number of laws of nature might be infinite, thus any attempt towards the theory of everything is doomed. Here I propose a special or restricted theory of regularity. The main difference as to the well-known version of that theory is both the range of validity and the scale of the laws of nature. Laws of nature ought to be considered just inside the observable universe and within certain energy and length scales. Even so I apply the theory of regularity to the multiverse scenario. As a consequence, the special theory of regularity supports only two types of multiverses by comparison with our world: those ones with a different sequence of unique events and different laws of nature and those ones with the same sequence of unique events and the same laws of nature instanced by the unique events. The latter case is some sort of eternal recurrence or a parallel eternal recurrence.</description>
