      <title>Highly Efficient Superconducting Diodes and Rectifiers for Quantum Circuitry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting electronics is essential for energy-efficient quantum and classical high-end computing applications. Towards this goal, non-reciprocal superconducting circuit elements, such as superconducting diodes (SDs) can fulfill many critical needs. SDs have been the subject of multiple studies, but integrating several SDs in a superconducting circuit remains a challenge. Here we implement the first SD bridge with multiple SDs exhibiting reproducible characteristics operating at temperatures of a few Kelvin. We demonstrate its functionality as a full wave rectifier using elemental superconductors and insulating ferromagnets, with efficiency up to 43%, and ac to dc signal conversion capabilities at frequencies up to 40 kHz. Our results show a pathway with a highly scalable thin film platform for nonreciprocal superconducting circuits. They could significantly reduce energy consumption as well as decohering thermal and electromagnetic noise in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Controlled Erasure as a Building Block for Universal Thermodynamically-Robust Superconducting Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the energy inefficiency of conventional CMOS-based computing devices -- which rely on logically irreversible gates to process information -- remains both a fundamental engineering challenge and a practical social challenge of increasing importance. In this work, we extend an alternative computing paradigm which utilizes distributions of microstates to store information in the metastable minima determined by an effective potential energy landscape. These minima serve as mesoscopic memory states which are manipulated by a dynamic landscape to perform information processing. Central to our results is the control erase (CE) protocol, which manipulates the landscape's metastable minima to control whether information is preserved or erased. Importantly, successive executions of this protocol can implement a NAND gate -- a logically-irreversible universal logic gate. We show how to practically implement this in a device created by two inductively coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). We identify circuit parameter ranges that give rise to effective CEs and characterize the protocol's robustness by comparing relevant protocol timescales. Due to their superconducting operational temperatures, performing optimized CEs with SQUIDs can serve as a platform for highly energy-efficient universal computation.</description>

      <title>Realization of a classical Ruddlesden Popper type bilayer nickelate in Sr$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-\delta}$ with unusual Ni$^{4+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at pressures greater than 14 GPa presents a unique opportunity to study a novel class of high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, other bilayer nickelate following the classical ($T^{4+}$) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) series of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ would present an interesting new candidate. In this work, we study the stabilization of RP $n=2$ phase in Sr$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$, via floating zone growth of crystals. With powder and single crystal XRD, we study the stability range of the RP-type phase. Our Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas extraction studies reveal a remarkably high oxidation state of Ni$^{4+}$. The obtained black crystals are insulating in transport and show a magnetic transition around 12 K.</description>

      <title>Coherence Length of Electronic Nematicity in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) advance the visualization of electronic nematicity and nematic domain structures in iron-based superconductors. In FeSe and BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.87}$P$_{0.13}$)$_2$ superconductors, it has been reported that the thickness of the electronic nematic domain walls is unexpectedly long, leading to the formation of mesoscopic nematicity wave [T. Shimojima $\textit{et al.}$, Science $\textbf{373}$ (2021) 1122]. This finding demonstrates that the nematic coherence length $\xi_{\rm nem}$ can be decoupled from the lattice domain wall. Here, we report that the electronic domain wall thickness shows a distinct variation in related materials: it is similarly long in FeSe$_{0.9}$S$_{0.1}$ whereas it is much shorter in undoped BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We find a correlation between the thick domain walls and the non-Fermi liquid properties of normal-state resistivity above the nematic transition temperature. This suggests that the nematic coherence length can be enhanced by underlying spin-orbital fluctuations responsible for the anomalous transport properties.</description>

      <title>Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states and identify a family of organic semiconductors exhibiting the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through chemical functionalisation and through the dielectric environment of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>

      <title>Emergence and evolution of electronic modes with temperature in spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic modes emerge within the band gap at nonzero temperature in strongly correlated insulators such as Mott and Kondo insulators, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. As the temperature increases, the emergent modes gain considerable spectral weights and form robust bands that differ from the zero-temperature bands. Here, the origin of the emergent modes, their relation to doping-induced modes, and how their spectral weights increase with temperature are clarified in the ladder and bilayer Hubbard models and one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattice models using effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping and numerical calculations. The results indicate that the temperature-driven change in the band structure reflecting spin excitation, including the change in the number of bands, can be observed in various strongly correlated insulators even with a spin gap, provided that the temperature increases up to about spin-excitation energies. The controlled analyses developed in this study significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the band structure of strongly correlated insulators at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci string-net condensate, a complex topological state that supports non-Abelian anyon excitations, holds promise for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, its realization by a static-lattice Hamiltonian has remained elusive due to the inherent high-order interactions demanded. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, that can dynamically prepare the state through reconfigurable graphs. DSNP enables the creation and manipulation of the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC). Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with a composite error-mitigation strategy on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid Fibonacci anyons in two spatial dimensions (2D) demonstrating their potential for universal quantum computation. To this end, we measure anyon charges for two species of anyons associated with the doubled topological quantum field theory underlying Fid-SNC, with an average experimental accuracy of 94%. We validate that a scalable 2D braiding operation on a logical qubit encoded on three anyons yields the golden ratio $\phi$ with 98% average accuracy and 8% measurement uncertainty. We further sample the Fib-SNC wavefunction to estimate the chromatic polynomial at $\phi+2$ for various graphs. Given the established computational hardness of the chromatic polynomial, the wavefunction amplitude is classically hard to evaluate. Our results establish the first proof of principle that scalable DSNP can open doors to fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and to classically-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning guided discovery of stable, spin-resolved topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index in a spinful two dimensional insulator indicates the presence of an odd, quantized (pseudo)spin-resolved Chern number, $C_{s}=(C_{\uparrow}-C_{\downarrow})/2$. However, the statement is not biconditional. An odd spin-Chern number can survive when the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index vanishes. Identification of solid-state systems hosting an odd, quantized $C_{s}$ and trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index is a pressing issue due to the potential for such insulators to admit band gaps optimal for experiments and quantum devices. Nevertheless, they have proven elusive due to the computational expense associated with their discovery. In this work, a neural network capable of identifying the spin-Chern number is developed and used to identify the first solid-state systems hosting a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index and odd $C_{s}$. We demonstrate the potential of one such system, Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$, to support Majorana corner modes via the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Is spontaneous vortex generation in superconducting 4Hb-TaS$_2$ from vison-vortex nucleation with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the superconducting van der Waals material 4Hb-TaS$_2$ to realize the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and interpret the recent discovery of the spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as the vison-vortex nucleation. For the alternating stacking of metallic/superconducting and Mott insulating layers in 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we expect the local moments in the Mott insulating 1T-TaS$_2$ layer to form the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. The spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is interpreted from the transition or nucleation between the superconducting vortex and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vison in different phase regimes. Differing from the single vison-vortex nucleation in the original Senthil-Fisher's cuprate proposal, we consider such nucleation process between the superconducting vortex lattice and the vison crystal. We further propose experiments to distinguish this proposal with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order from the chiral spin liquid scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the Josephson current-phase relation within a planar diffuse tunneling superconducting multilayer junction subjected to a parallel magnetic field. Our investigation involves computing the supercurrent associated with a fixed jump in the phase of the order parameter at each of the two insulating interfaces, allowing us to derive the current-phase relation for the junction. Employing perturbation theory in junction conductance, we determine both the first and second harmonics of the current-phase relation under specific magnetic field conditions. Notably, the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction in the middle region of the junction introduces an anomalous Josephson effect. The interplay between spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions results in the emergence of an effective vector potential. This specific characteristic induces a phase shift in each harmonic of the current-phase relation without altering the overall shape of the relation. The mechanism for the Josephson diode effect is discussed for disordered junctions of multiband superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conducting altermagnets have recently emerged as intriguing materials supporting strongly spin-polarized currents without magnetic stray fields. We demonstrate that altermagnets enable three key functionalities, merging superconductivity and spintronics. The first prediction is a controllable supercurrent-induced edge magnetization, which acts like a dissipationless spin-splitter effect. The second and third predictions are a Cooper pair spin-splitter and a filtering effect, respectively. These effects allow for spatial separation of triplet pairs with opposite spin-polarizations and spin-selective tunneling of Cooper pairs. We derive a quasiclassical theory with associated boundary conditions that describe these phenomena and explain how they can be experimentally verified. Our results open a new path for spatial control of spin signals via triplet Cooper pairs using hybrid superconductor-altermagnet devices.</description>

Abstract: Pair density Waves (PDW) are a inhomogeneous superconducting states whose Cooper pairs posses a finite momentum resulting in a oscillatory gap in space, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. There is growing evidence for the existence of PDW superconducting order in many strongly correlated materials particularly in the cuprate superconductios and in several other different types of systems. A feature of the PDW state is that inherently it has a CDW as a composite order associated with it. Here we study the structure of the electronic topological defects of the PDW, paying special attention to the half-vortex and its electronic structure that can be detected in STM experiments. We discuss tell-tale signatures of the defects in violations of inversion symmetry, in the excitation spectrum and their spectral functions in the presence of topological defects. We discuss the "Fermi surface" topology of Bogoliubov quasi-particle of the PDW phases and we briefly discuss the role of quasi-particle-interference.</description>

      <title>On dualities of paired quantum Hall bilayer states at $\nu_T = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-balanced, widely separated quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu_T = 1$ can be described as two copies of composite Fermi liquids (CFLs). The two CFLs have interlayer weak-coupling BCS instabilities mediated by gauge fluctuations, the resulting pairing symmetry of which depends on the CFL hypothesis used. If both layers are described by the conventional Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory-based composite electron liquid (CEL), the dominant pairing instability is in the $p+ip$ channel; whereas if one layer is described by CEL and the other by a composite hole liquid (CHL, in the sense of anti-HLR), the dominant pairing instability occurs in the $s$-wave channel. Using the Dirac composite fermion (CF) picture, we show that these two pairing channels can be mapped onto each other by particle-hole (PH) transformation. Furthermore, we derive the CHL theory as the non-relativistic limit of the PH-transformed massive Dirac CF theory. Finally, we prove that an effective topological field theory for the paired CEL-CHL in the weak-coupling limit is equivalent to the exciton condensate phase in the strong-coupling limit.</description>
