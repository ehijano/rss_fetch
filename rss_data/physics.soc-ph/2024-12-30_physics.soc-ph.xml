      <title>A Vehicle Size-Based Dynamic Model of Artificial Driving Risk Potential Fields and Vehicle Interaction Analysis for Highway Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional driving risk potential field model generally assumes uniform vehicle sizes, which fails to reflect the heterogeneity in real-world traffic environment. This study aims to develop an improved model by introducing the vehicle dimensions into the driving risk potential field framework. Vehicles are categorized based on size into standard-sized vehicles, medium-sized vehicles, and large-sized vehicles. And the interactions between two vehicles and the force field excited by the driving risk potential field are investigated in this paper. Our analysis of the risk field contours at various vehicle speeds and sizes reveals that larger and faster vehicles generate more intense and expansive risk fields, necessitating increased following distances. For larger vehicles, the risk field extends into adjacent lanes. Force field analysis demonstrates that vehicles traveling in adjacent lanes undergo changes in their motion state due to the influence of the force field emanating from the neighboring larger vehicles. The model effectively points out that, for adjacent lanes, the regions surrounding the tail and head of high-speed vehicles represent highly risky zones.</description>

      <title>Innovation beyond intention: harnessing exaptation for technological breakthroughs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frameworks that explore scientific and technological evolution suggest that discoveries and inventions are intrinsic processes, while the wealth of knowledge accumulated over time enables researchers to make further advancements, echoing Newton's sentiment of "standing on the shoulders of giants." Despite the exponential growth in new scientific and technical knowledge, the consolidation-disruption (D) index suggests a concerning decline in the disruptiveness of papers and patents. "Exaptation" a concept borrowed from biological evolution, is now recognized as a pivotal yet often neglected mechanism in technological evolution. Significant technologies often do not emerge out of thin air but rather result from the application of existing technologies in other domains. For instance, bird feathers initially served as waterproofing and insulation before enabling flight, and microwave ovens originated from radar magnetrons. Exaptation, acknowledged as the catalyst for "innovation beyond intention" signifies a cross-field evolutionary process that is driven by functional shifts in pre-existing knowledge, technology, or artifacts. In this study, we introduce the concept of exaptation value, deliberately excluding serendipity. Our analysis reveals that, despite a declining trend in the disruptiveness of innovation, there is an increasing trend in the application of cross-domain knowledge within the innovation process over time. We also explore the impact of technology exaptation on innovation disruptiveness and discuss how leveraging technology adaptability enhances innovation's disruptive potential.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of the spatial SEIR-HCD model of COVID-19 propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the identifiability of a spatial mathematical model of the spread of fast-moving epidemics based on the law of acting masses and diffusion processes. The research algorithm is based on global methods of Sobol sensitivity analysis and Bayesian approach, which together allowed to reduce the variation boundaries of unknown parameters for further solving the problem of parameter identification by measurements of the number of detected cases, critical and dead. It is shown that for identification of diffusion coefficients responsible for the rate of movement of individuals in space, it is necessary to use additional information about the process.</description>

      <title>A double explosive Kuramoto transition in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a generalised concept that will enable double explosive transitions in the forward and backward directions or a combination thereof. We found two essential factors for generating such phase transitions: the use of higher-order (triadic) interactions and the partial adaptation of a global order parameter acting on the triadic coupling. A compromise between the two factors may result in a double explosive transition. To reinforce numerical observations, we employed the Ott--Antonsen ansatz. We observed that for a wide class of hypergraphs, combining two elements can result in a double explosive transition.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Random walks on bifractal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that networks possessing scale-free and fractal properties may exhibit a bifractal nature, in which local structures are described by two different fractal dimensions. In this study, we investigate random walks on such fractal scale-free networks (FSFNs) by examining the walk dimension $d_{\text{w}}$ and the spectral dimension $d_{\text{s}}$, to understand how the bifractality affects their dynamical properties. The walk dimension is found to be unaffected by the difference in local fractality of an FSFN and remains constant regardless of the starting node of a random walk, whereas the spectral dimension takes two values, $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$ and $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}(&gt; d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}})$, depending on the starting node. The dimension $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$ characterizes the return probability of a random walker starting from an infinite-degree hub node in the thermodynamic limit, while $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}$ describes that of a random walker starting from a finite-degree non-hub node infinitely distant from hub nodes and is equal to the global spectral dimension $D_{\text{s}}$. The existence of two local spectral dimensions is a direct consequence of the bifractality of the FSFN. Furthermore, analytical expressions of $d_{\text{w}}$, $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$, and $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}$ are presented for FSFNs formed by the generator model and the giant components of critical scale-free random graphs, and are numerically confirmed.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Sustainability Value and Dignified Well-Being in Inclusive Product Lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sustainability is a concept mainly assessed by the features of a product that are considered as specific metrics for sustainability in an engineering context. However, sustainability is a comprehensive process for improvement in sustainable development that can be structured with the influence of inclusivity of empowered people. We define sustainability value, which measures the merit of the process to contribute to sustainable development. Sustainability is interrelated with the well-being and dignity of people; we propose a formula for dignified well-being to evaluate the benefit of dignity and well-being in an inclusive product lifecycle. This study uses the framework for assessing inclusivity and empowerment to correlate the influence of inclusivity of empowered people on sustainability value and dignified well-being. Based on the strength of the correlation, we can support the hypothesis that the inclusivity of empowered people can influence the sustainability value of the process and the dignified well-being of stakeholders. Due to the integration of qualitative methods in our approaches, we tested it with an intercoder reliability test with three coders. Results show high coder agreement and the generalisability of the framework.</description>

      <title>Global Prediction of COVID-19 Variant Emergence Using Dynamics-Informed Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the new variant and the timings of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. Can we predict when a variant existing elsewhere will arrive in a given region? To address this question, we propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, we derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that apply to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics motivate the introduction of certain features in the GNN. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamics-informed GNN outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). To advance research in this area, we introduce a benchmarking tool to assess a user-defined model's prediction performance across 87 countries and 36 variants.</description>

      <title>COARA will not save science from the tyranny of administrative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) agreement is a cornerstone in the ongoing efforts to reform research evaluation. CoARA advocates for administrative evaluations of research that rely on peer review, supported by responsible metrics, as beneficial for both science and society. Its principles can be critically examined through the lens of Philip Kitcher's concept of well-ordered science in a democratic society. From Kitcher's perspective, CoARA's approach faces two significant challenges: definitions of quality and impact are determined by governments or evaluation institutions rather than emerging from broad public deliberation, and a select group of scientists is empowered to assess research based on these predefined criteria. This creates susceptibility to both the ''tyranny of expertise'' and the ''tyranny of ignorance'' that Kitcher cautions against. Achieving Kitcher's ideal would require limiting administrative evaluations to essential tasks, such as researcher recruitment and project funding, while establishing procedures grounded in principles of fairness.</description>
