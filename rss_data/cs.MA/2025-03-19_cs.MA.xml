      <title>Adaptive AUV Hunting Policy with Covert Communication via Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative underwater target hunting, facilitated by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), plays a significant role in various domains, especially military missions. Existing research predominantly focuses on designing efficient and high-success-rate hunting policy, particularly addressing the target's evasion capabilities. However, in real-world scenarios, the target can not only adjust its evasion policy based on its observations and predictions but also possess eavesdropping capabilities. If communication among hunter AUVs, such as hunting policy exchanges, is intercepted by the target, it can adapt its escape policy accordingly, significantly reducing the success rate of the hunting mission. To address this challenge, we propose a covert communication-guaranteed collaborative target hunting framework, which ensures efficient hunting in complex underwater environments while defending against the target's eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the confidentiality of inter-agent communication into the design of target hunting policy. Furthermore, given the complexity of coordinating multiple AUVs in dynamic and unpredictable environments, we propose an adaptive multi-agent diffusion policy (AMADP), which incorporates the strong generative ability of diffusion models into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AMADP achieves faster convergence and higher hunting success rates while maintaining covertness constraints.</description>

      <title>LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The NL Controller, which uses an LLM to simulate human-like interventions, showed a stronger impact than the RB Controller. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>When Should We Orchestrate Multiple Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategies for orchestrating the interactions between multiple agents, both human and artificial, can wildly overestimate performance and underestimate the cost of orchestration. We design a framework to orchestrate agents under realistic conditions, such as inference costs or availability constraints. We show theoretically that orchestration is only effective if there are performance or cost differentials between agents. We then empirically demonstrate how orchestration between multiple agents can be helpful for selecting agents in a simulated environment, picking a learning strategy in the infamous Rogers' Paradox from social science, and outsourcing tasks to other agents during a question-answer task in a user study.</description>

      <title>Stable Task Allocation in Multi-Agent Systems with Lexicographic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing interest in the explicit representation and handling of various "preference" structures arising in modern digital economy, this work introduces a new class of "one-to-many stable-matching" problems where a set of atomic tasks must be stably allocated to a set of agents. An important characteristic of these stable-matching problems is the very arbitrary specification of the task subsets constituting "feasible" allocations for each agent. It is shown that as long as the agents rank their feasible task allocations lexicographically with respect to their stated preferences for each atomic task, matching stability reduces to the absence of blocking agent-task pairs. This result, together with a pertinent graphical representation of feasible allocations, enable (i) the representation of the space of stable matchings as a set of linear constraints with binary variables, and (ii) the specification and handling of certain notions of optimality within this space of stable matchings. The last part of the paper also addresses the notion of "substitutability" in the considered problem context.</description>

      <title>A Convex Formulation of Game-theoretic Hierarchical Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical decision-making is a natural paradigm for coordinating multi-agent systems in complex environments such as air traffic management. In this paper, we present a bilevel framework for game-theoretic hierarchical routing, where a high-level router assigns discrete routes to multiple vehicles who seek to optimize potentially noncooperative objectives that depend upon the assigned routes. To address computational challenges, we propose a reformulation that preserves the convexity of each agent's feasible set. This convex reformulation enables a solution to be identified efficiently via a customized branch-and-bound algorithm. Our approach ensures global optimality while capturing strategic interactions between agents at the lower level. We demonstrate the solution concept of our framework in two-vehicle and three-vehicle routing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Bloat in Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software bloat refers to code and features that is not used by a software during runtime. For Machine Learning (ML) systems, bloat is a major contributor to their technical debt leading to decreased performance and resource wastage. In this work, we present, Negativa-ML, a novel tool to identify and remove bloat in ML frameworks by analyzing their shared libraries. Our approach includes novel techniques to detect and locate unnecessary code within device code - a key area overlooked by existing research, which focuses primarily on host code. We evaluate Negativa-ML using four popular ML frameworks across ten workloads over 300 shared libraries. The results demonstrate that the ML frameworks are highly bloated on both the device and host code side. On average, Negativa-ML reduces the device code size in these frameworks by up to 75% and the host code by up to 72%, resulting in total file size reductions of up to 55%. The device code is a primary source of bloat within ML frameworks. Through debloating, we achieve reductions in peak host memory usage, peak GPU memory usage, and execution time by up to 74.6%, 69.6%, and 44.6%, respectively.</description>

      <title>KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14234v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Destructive Bribery in Approval-Based Multi-winner Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.00836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of constructive manipulation, control, and bribery problems for approval-based multiwinner voting have been extensively studied recently. However, their destructive counterparts seem to be less explored. This paper investigates the complexity of several destructive bribery problems under five prestigious approval-based multiwinner voting rules -- approval voting, satisfaction approval voting, net-satisfaction approval voting, Chamberlin-Courant approval voting, and proportional approval voting. Broadly, these problems are to determine if a number of given candidates can be excluded from any winning committees by performing a limited number of modification operations. We offer a complete landscape of the complexity of the problems. For NP-hard problems, we study their parameterized complexity with respect to meaningful parameters.</description>

      <title>A Game of Pawns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study pawn games, a class of two-player zero-sum turn-based graph games. A turn-based graph game proceeds by placing a token on an initial vertex, and whoever controls the vertex on which the token is located, chooses its next location. This leads to a path in the graph, which determines the winner. Traditionally, the control of vertices is predetermined and fixed. The novelty of pawn games is that control of vertices changes dynamically throughout the game as follows. Each vertex of a pawn game is owned by a pawn. In each turn, the pawns are partitioned between the two players, and the player who controls the pawn that owns the vertex on which the token is located, chooses the next location of the token. Control of pawns changes dynamically throughout the game according to a fixed mechanism. Specifically, we define several grabbing-based mechanisms in which control of at most one pawn transfers at the end of each turn. We study the complexity of solving pawn games, where we focus on reachability objectives and parameterize the problem by the mechanism that is being used and by restrictions on pawn ownership of vertices. On the positive side, even though pawn games are exponentially-succinct turn-based games, we identify several natural classes that can be solved in PTIME. On the negative side, we identify several EXPTIME-complete classes, where our hardness proofs are based on a new class of games called Lock &amp; Key games, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unsynchronized Decentralized Q-Learning: Two Timescale Analysis By Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stationarity is a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents update their behaviour as they learn. Many theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of non-stationarity by coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies. Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multi-timescale methods, but such synchronization is infeasible in many decentralized applications. In this paper, we study an unsynchronized variant of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient conditions under which the unsynchronized algorithm drives play to equilibrium with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchronization assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to unsynchronized generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multi-timescale methods that study Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics. This work extends the applicability of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm and its relatives to settings in which parameters are selected in an independent manner, and tames non-stationarity without imposing the coordination assumptions of prior work.</description>

      <title>Sable: a Performant, Efficient and Scalable Sequence Model for MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>

      <title>OffLight: An Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient traffic control (TSC) is essential for urban mobility, but traditional systems struggle to handle the complexity of real-world traffic. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</description>
