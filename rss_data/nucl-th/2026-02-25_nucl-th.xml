      <title>Probing Neutron Skins with KDAR Neutrinos: From Coherent to Diffractive Elastic Neutrino--Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) induced by pion--decay--at--rest ($\pi$DAR) and kaon--decay--at--rest (KDAR) neutrinos, with emphasis on the transition from strict coherence to the diffractive regime. Organizing CE$\nu$NS observables in terms of the dimensionless variable $qR$, we show that $\pi$DAR measurements remain confined to the near--coherent region for all nuclei, whereas KDAR neutrinos ($E_\nu=236$~MeV) extend the kinematics into $qR\gtrsim1$, where recoil spectra develop genuine shape sensitivity to the nuclear weak form factor. Using representative light, medium--mass, and heavy nuclei ($^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb), we examine relevant cross sections and quantify the statistical sensitivity to the neutron skin thickness achievable at a JSNS$^2$--like facility. For a total exposure of 10~ton$\cdot$year and realistic KDAR fluences, projected $1\sigma$ sensitivities reach $\Delta R_{np}^{\,(1 \sigma)}$ $\simeq0.09$--$0.02$~fm for $^{48}$Ca and $\simeq0.07$--$0.02$~fm for $^{208}$Pb as the fluence increases. These sensitivities are competitive with, and complementary to, parity--violating electron--scattering measurements such as CREX and PREX, while relying on an electroweakly clean neutral--current probe with distinct systematic uncertainties. 
Our results establish KDAR--based CE$\nu$NS as a quantitatively robust and complementary avenue for probing neutron skins and nuclear weak densities beyond the coherent limit.</description>

      <title>Empirical formula for total inelastic cross-section of proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generic empirical formula for total inelastic cross-sections for various target nuclei scattered by a proton at different energies, which is applicable over a wide range of energy from $15 ~MeV$ to $1~ TeV$. The proposed model is parameterized based on the fitting of extensively studied experimental cross-section data for the Aluminium and Carbon nucleus targets, considering factorization over high-energy and low-energy regimes. The parameters in high-energy formula are determined by the fitting of the high-energy saturation value of the inelastic scattering cross-section data with mass numbers. The universality of the empirical formula is investigated by comparing the model prediction with the experimental data of inelastic proton-nucleus scattering over a wide range from light elements such as Deuterium to heavy elements such as Uranium. A detailed comparison with the existing models and GEANT4 simulation is also presented.</description>

      <title>Resummed azimuthal decorrelation and transverse momentum imbalance of dijets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the azimuthal decorrelation $\delta\phi$ and transverse momentum imbalance $q_T$ in dijet production at the LHC, offering intriguing insights into the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics. We define the jet axes using the recoil-free winner-take-all (WTA) recombination scheme. For the azimuthal decorrelation $\delta\phi$, this axis choice eliminates non-global logarithms (NGLs) entirely. For the transverse momentum imbalance $q_T$, NGLs emerge specifically in the small jet radius limit ($R \ll 1$). In this regime, the WTA scheme simplifies the theoretical framework by restricting jet radius logarithms to the soft sector. We derive factorization formulae for both observables within soft-collinear effective theory. To address the small-$R$ NGLs in the $q_T$ distribution, we refactorize the soft function into global soft, collinear-soft, and ultra-collinear-soft modes. We perform the resummation of global large logarithms $\ln(\delta\phi)$ and $\ln(q_T/Q)$ up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. For the $q_T$ distribution, this is combined with a leading-logarithmic resummation of the non-global $\ln R$ terms. We match our predictions to leading fixed-order $O(\alpha_s^3)$ calculations. We also numerically investigate the structure of the first subleading power corrections. Comparisons with PYTHIA8 simulations demonstrate that the observables we consider are robust against non-perturbative multi-parton interactions and hadronization effects.</description>

      <title>Resolving the structure of bound states using lattice quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first lattice calculation of a two-to-two particle matrix element of a local current. This exploratory calculation is performed using a leading-order pionless effective field theory of two nucleons in a finite 3D spatial volume, where the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly for moderate volumes. By considering a range of couplings where the theory supports a deuteron-like bound state, we determine the finite-volume spectra and matrix elements of the conserved local vector current. Using the L\"uscher formalism, we constrain the infinite-volume, purely hadronic amplitude for this theory. Using previously derived formalism, we then map the finite-volume matrix elements to scattering amplitudes describing a reaction coupling two-particle states via a current insertion, $\2+\Jc \to \2$. We then use a recently derived relation between this class of amplitudes and the bound-state elastic form factor to directly constrain the infinite-volume form factor. By varying over a range of values of the coupling of the theory, we explore the effects of this analysis for deep-bound states and shallow-bound states. We reproduce the expected result that for deep bound states, the finite-volume formalism is largely unnecessary, while for shallow bound states, it is absolutely critical to obtain a sensible result. We present a detailed outline of the analysis of this class of matrix elements, including the determination of the charge radius of the bound state. In the shallow bound state limit, we find good agreement with the prediction stemming from the anomalous threshold.</description>

      <title>Spatial confinement-deconfinement transition in accelerated gluodynamics within lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of weak acceleration on the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics. Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of the observation of $\eta^{\prime}$ mesic nuclei in the semi-exclusive $^{12}$C($p, dp$) reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the feasibility of the semi-exclusive $^{12}$C($p,dp$)$X$ reaction for the observation of $\eta^\prime$ mesic nuclei using the microscopic transport model JAM. The semi-exclusive measurements of the ($p,d$) reaction with protons from $\eta^\prime$ absorption are found to be significant for the observation of the $\eta^\prime$ bound states. Especially, the measurements of the energetic protons from $\eta^\prime$ non-mesic two-body absorption ($\eta^\prime NN \to NN$) are considered to be critically important. The Green's function method is used to calculate the expected spectrum of forward going deuterons corresponding to the excitation energy spectrum of the $\eta^\prime \otimes {}^{11}$C system in the semi-exclusive measurement. The semi-exclusive measurements are shown to be important in general for the $\eta^\prime$ mesic nucleus observation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Phase-Transition EoS using the Energy Dependence of Directed Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid equation of state (VDF+MIT EoS) to describe the hadron-quark phase transition in dense nuclear matter. By coupling this EoS with the AMPT-HC transport model and comparing to recent experimental data on proton and $\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$, we constrain the transition to likely occur near $5\rho_0$--$6\rho_0$, ruling out transitions below $3\rho_0$. Furthermore, we introduce the energy derivative of the mid-rapidity $v_1$ slope, $d(dv_1/dy)/d(\sqrt{s_{NN}})$, as a weakly model-dependent observable. Its zero crossing provides a direct signature of the phase transition critical point, offering a new tool for mapping the QCD phase diagram in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Imprint of $\alpha$-Clustering on Ab Initio Correlations in Relativistic Light Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of $\alpha$-cluster structures in relativistic light nuclear collisions. Using a cluster framework, I extract the characteristics of the nucleonic configurations of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne as predicted by various \textit{ab-initio} models, including Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT), Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). Additionally, I analyze configurations derived from a three-parameter Fermi (3pF) density function. The investigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point correlators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne). The cluster parameters are determined by minimizing the \textit{chi-square} statistic to align the nucleon distributions with those predicted by the aforementioned theories. The results reveal that perturbative calculations effectively capture the structural features of these nuclei, while comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations validate these findings. Furthermore, the analysis reveals distinct cluster geometries: VMC suggests tetrahedral shapes, while NLEFT, PGCM, and 3pF indicate irregular triangular pyramids. Notably, NLEFT shows a bowling pin-like $\alpha$ cluster structure for $^{20}$Ne. The study also identifies constraints on cluster parameters in the different oxygen structures, with a gradual increase in $\varepsilon_2\{2\}$ for the states of $\alpha$+$^{12}$C. Accurate modeling of asymmetric collisions necessitates a range of nucleons from heavy spherical nuclei, leading to weighted correlators in perturbative calculations. I demonstrate consistency between perturbative calculations and Monte Carlo models, with analytical calculations providing more insights into asymmetric than symmetric collisions.</description>

      <title>Two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ decay to excited states at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-neutrino double-beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) into first-excited $0^+_2$ states of nuclei used in $\beta\beta$ decay experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe. We calculate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) within the nuclear shell model, using various Hamiltonians that describe well the spectroscopy of the initial and final nuclei. We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can significantly increase due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and consistent with the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.</description>

      <title>Probing in-medium effect via giant dipole resonance in the extended quantum molecular dynamics model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rather than using the geometric method employed in the original Extended Quantum Molecular Dynamics (EQMD) model, this article employs a stochastic approach to analyze the collision term and examine the width of the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) in ${}^{208}$Pb. Based on the ``soft" EQMD model, which we recently developed, the response and strength functions are self-consistently determined for various symmetry energy coefficients and in-medium reduction factor values. The results confirm that the peak position and GDR width in ${}^{208}$Pb are highly sensitive to the symmetry energy and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon ({\it NN}) cross section. This provides an opportunity to study the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and the medium effect. A significant reduction in free {\it NN} elastic cross sections within the medium is necessary to accurately reproduce the GDR width, as demonstrated by a comparison with the evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of pygmy dipole resonance with its gamma decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isospin properties and the collectivity of the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) are long-standing open questions in nuclear structure studies. To answer these questions, the $\gamma$-decay of PDR states in $^{208}$Pb to the low-lying $2_{1}^{+}$ state is investigated using the Skyrme particle-vibration coupling (PVC) model. It is found that the $E1$ $\gamma$ decay from the PDR states to the low-lying $2_{1}^+$ state is strongly suppressed compared to that from the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR), which reveals the predominantly isoscalar character of PDR. A detailed decomposition of the decay diagrams of the amplitudes of the processes contributing to the decay demonstrates the non-negligible presence of the 1 particle-1 hole configurations coupled to the $2_1^{+}$ phonon in the PDR wave function. Furthermore, we give a quantitative way to identify the components of complex-configurations in the wave function, and it is found that such component in PDR is smaller than that in IVGDR and much smaller than that in isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR).</description>

Abstract: A recent work considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider the more efficient representation of the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is discretized by using the Green's function of the discrete Laplacian operator under the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian and the discretized one proposed here guarantee that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields are decoupled and commute with the corresponding Hamiltonian. Thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate count for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy, and Hamiltonian parameters in lattice units. The gate cost here for implementing the time evolution of the gauge field is reduced at least by a factor on the order of $10^8$ for modest lattice size and accuracy level compared with the previous work.</description>

      <title>Dihadron fragmentation framework for near-side energy-energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an approach to analyze the free hadron and transition (nonperturbative) regions of near-side energy-energy correlators (EECs) based on dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFFs). We introduce a (nonperturbative) function we call the "EEC-DiFF" and explicitly show that expanding it for large relative transverse momentum between the two hadrons gives the $O(\alpha_s)$ expression for the "EEC jet" function used in the quark/gluon (perturbative) region. This connection indicates that a formal theoretical matching will be able to bridge the free hadron, transition, and quark/gluon regions and allow all of them to be analyzed simultaneously. We further derive a result valid for near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions of $e^+e^-$ annihilation in terms of the EEC-DiFF. Using a simple model for the function, we perform the first fit within the dihadron framework to experimental data in this regime. We find reasonable agreement with the measurements and reproduce the salient features of near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity distributions in QCD jets and jet topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling functions for quark- and gluon-initiated jets by incorporating energy conservation into the Double Logarithmic Approximation (DLA). The resulting modified DLA (MDLA) expressions differ substantially from the DLA predictions and qualitatively align with the recently proposed QCD-inspired expressions, albeit with some quantitative differences. By fixing the two parameters in the MDLA expressions, we show that the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity distributions of the two leading jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, measured by ATLAS over a wide jet $p_T$ range of $0.1$-$2.5$ TeV, are well described within experimental uncertainties and consistent with PYTHIA simulations. This conclusion is further supported by direct comparisons with quark- and gluon-initiated jet distributions extracted via jet topics, though the propagated uncertainties from experimental data remain sizable.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>
