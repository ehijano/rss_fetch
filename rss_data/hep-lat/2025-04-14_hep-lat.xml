      <title>Centre vortices in thermal lattice QCD with dynamical fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for a second finite-temperature transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is revealed through the study of centre vortex geometry and its temperature-dependent evolution. Using the anisotropic dynamical ensembles from the Fastsum collaboration, we conduct a detailed analysis at several temperatures above and below the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial lattice slices demonstrate that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at approximately twice the chiral transition temperature, T_c. This indicates that confinement is maintained up to T \approx 2T_c, suggesting a second transition associated with deconfinement. The loss of percolation, quantified by vortex cluster extent, provides a clear signal for this transition. Statistical analysis of vortex density and cluster extent is presented which reveals consistent evidence of two transitions in QCD: the chiral transition at T_c and the deconfinement transition at T_d \approx 2T_c. By analysing these, and other quantities, we obtain a precise determination of the deconfinement temperature, T_d = 321(6) MeV.</description>

      <title>Kaon radiative leptonic decay rates from lattice QCD simulations at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the radiative leptonic decay rates of the kaon, improving upon our previous work, arXiv:2006.05358. Our analysis uses gauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For the first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including quark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been implemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light- and strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated using lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \simeq 3.8\,\mathrm{fm}$ to $L \simeq 7.7\,\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on three lattice spacings in the range $a \in [0.08, 0.058]\,\mathrm{fm}$. As a result of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation functions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form factors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When compared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \to e^- \bar{\nu}_e \gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$ standard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are compatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the muonic decay channel ($K^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \gamma$), we confirm the tensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD predictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the value of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.</description>

      <title>Kaon and Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drell-Levy-Yan relation is employed to obtain pion and kaon elementary fragmentation functions (EFFs) from the hadron-scale parton distribution functions (DFs) of these mesons. Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We analytically show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <title>Can the strong interactions between hadrons be determined using femtoscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, femtoscopic measurements from heavy-ion collisions have become a popular tool to investigate the strong interactions between hadrons. The key observables measured in such experiments are the two-hadron momentum correlations, which depend on the production mechanism of hadron pairs and the final-state interactions. Given the complexity of ultra-relativistic collision experiments, the source term describing the production mechanism can only be modeled phenomenologically based on numerous assumptions. The commonly employed approach for analyzing femtoscopic data relies on the Koonin-Pratt formula, which relates the measured correlation functions with the relative wave function of an outgoing hadron pair and a source term that is assumed to be universal. Here, we critically examine this universality assumption and show that for strongly interacting particles such as nucleons, the interpretation of femtoscopic measurements suffers from a potentially large intrinsic uncertainty. We also comment on the ongoing efforts to explore three-body interactions using this experimental technique.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence and identify the different volume scalings depending on the region. Using phenomenological inputs for \pi \pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor, we obtain an estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu, which is consistent with previous works. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Computing the UV-finite electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization in the muon $(g-2)$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reach a precision of $0.2\%$ on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, such that the full Standard-Model prediction matches in precision the direct experimental measurement, it is crucial to include the leading, O($\alpha$) electromagnetic corrections to HVP. In this work, we determine an important contribution to the latter from a diagram comprised of two two-point quark-loops, connected by the internal photon and gluons. This ultraviolet-finite correction is calculated from lattice QCD using a coordinate-space formalism, where photons are treated in the continuum and infinite volume. Our result amounts to a $(-0.89\pm 0.18)\%$ correction to the leading-order HVP contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. To overcome the worsening statistical noise at large distances, our analysis is combined with phenomenological models featuring light pseudoscalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV. In particular, our data show a very steep mass dependence as dictated by the charged pion loop. Similarly, the other diagrams appearing in the O$(\alpha)$-corrections to the HVP with the internal photon connecting two separate quark loops are also ultraviolet-finite and can be computed with the same formalism.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Hamiltonian method for two-particle systems containing long-range potential on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic method to block-diagonalize the finite volume effective Hamiltonian for two-particle systems with arbitrary spin in both the rest and moving frame. The framework is convenient and efficient for addressing the left-hand cut issue arising from long-range potential, which are challenging in the framework of standard L\"uscher formula. Furthermore, the method provides a foundation for further extension to three-particle systems. We first benchmark our method by examining several toy models, demonstrating its consistency with standard L\"uscher formula in the absence of long-range potential. In the presence of long-range potential, we investigate and resolve the effects and issues of left-hand cut. As a realistic application, we calculate the finite volume spectra of isoscalar $D\bar{D}^*$ system, where the well-known exotic state $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is observed. The results are qualitatively consistent with the lattice QCD calculation, highlighting the reliability and potential application of our framework to the study of other exotic states in hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>
