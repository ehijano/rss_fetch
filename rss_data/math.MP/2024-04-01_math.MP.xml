      <title>Twists of superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of ``conformal twists'' of superconformal field theories in dimensions 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. The conformal twists describe all possible inequivalent choices of a nilpotent element in the superconformal algebra. Such twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we leave these subtleties to future work. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Inversion Theorem for Normal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an inversion theorem for the Fourier transform defined for normal functions, in the case when such functions are of moderate decrease, and in dimensions 2 and 3. This improves on Carleson's general almost everywhere convergence result for square integrable functions to everywhere convergence, in the special case of normal functions of moderate decrease. The class of normal functions appear in Physics and the everywhere convergence is important for further analysis of wave equations and no radiation properties of electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Emerging Jordan blocks in the two-dimensional Potts and loop models at generic $Q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently suggested -- based on general self-consistency arguments as well as results from the bootstrap (arXiv:2005.07708, arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) -- that the CFT describing the $Q$-state Potts model is logarithmic for generic values of $Q$, with rank-two Jordan blocks for $L_0$ and ${\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu L\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu}_0$ in many sectors of the theory. This is despite the well-known fact that the lattice transfer matrix (or Hamiltonian) is diagonalizable in (arbitrary) finite size. While the emergence of Jordan blocks only in the limit $L\to\infty$ is perfectly possible conceptually, diagonalizability in finite size makes the measurement of logarithmic couplings (whose values are analytically predicted in arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) very challenging. This problem is solved in the present paper (which can be considered a companion to arXiv:2007.11539), and the conjectured logarithmic structure of the CFT confirmed in detail by the study of the lattice model and associated "emerging Jordan blocks."</description>

      <title>On the Hartree-Fock Ground State Manifold in Magic Angle Twisted Graphene Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can exhibit correlated insulator behavior at half-filling. Seminal theoretical results towards understanding this phase in MATBG has shown that Hartree-Fock ground states (with a positive charge gap) can be exact many-body ground states of an idealized flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree-Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a ${\rm U}(4) \times {\rm U}(4)$ hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions of Stochastic Burgers-KdV Equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will present exact solutions for three variations of stochastic Korteweg de Vries-Burgers (KdV-Burgers) equation featuring variable coefficients. In each variant, white noise exhibits spatial uniformity, and the three categories include additive, multiplicative, and advection noise. Across all cases, the coefficients are time-dependent functions. Our discovery indicates that solving certain deterministic counterparts of KdV-Burgers equations and composing the solution with a solution of stochastic differential equations leads to the exact solution of the stochastic Korteweg de Vries-Burgers (KdV-Burgers) equations.</description>

      <title>On Fractional Kinetic Equations Involving Srivastava Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic equations hold a very important place in physics and further their fractional generalization enhances the scope of their applicability and significance in describing the continuity of motion in materials. After the development of generalized form of fractional kinetic equations, many researchers proffered several new forms of these equations and found their solutions by different techniques. In this work, we have proposed some novel generalised fractional kinetic equations involving the Srivastava polynomial and, by applying the Laplace transform approach, their solutions are calculated. Further, to study the behaviour of these, numerical and graphical interpretation of the solutions are also provided.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectory of the one atom maser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system undergoing repeated indirect measurements naturally leads to a Markov chain on the set of states which is called a quantum trajectory. In this paper we consider a specific model of such a quantum trajectory associated to the one-atom maser model. It describes the evolution of one mode of the quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with two-level atoms. When the system is non-resonant we prove that this Markov chain admits a unique invariant probability measure. We moreover prove convergence in the Wasserstein metric towards this invariant measure. These results rely on a purification theorem: almost surely the state of the system approaches the set of pure states. Compared to similar results in the literature, the system considered here is infinite dimensional. While existence of an invariant measure is a consequence of the compactness of the set of states in finite dimension, in infinite dimension existence of an invariant measure is not free. Furthermore usual purification criterions in finite dimension have no straightforward equivalent in infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Designing Poisson Integrators Through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general method to construct Poisson integrators, i.e., integrators that preserve the underlying Poisson geometry. We assume the Poisson manifold is integrable, meaning there is a known local symplectic groupoid for which the Poisson manifold serves as the set of units. Our constructions build upon the correspondence between Poisson diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian bisections, which allows us to reformulate the design of Poisson integrators as solutions to a certain PDE (Hamilton-Jacobi). The main novelty of this work is to understand the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE as an optimization problem, whose solution can be easily approximated using machine learning related techniques. This research direction aligns with the current trend in the PDE and machine learning communities, as initiated by Physics- Informed Neural Networks, advocating for designs that combine both physical modeling (the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE) and data.</description>

      <title>Study on a Quantization Condition and the Solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger-type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study a quantization condition in relation to the solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This quantization condition is called the SWKB (supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) quantization condition and has been known in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for decades. The main contents of this thesis are recapitulated as follows: the foundation and the application of the SWKB quantization condition. The first half of this thesis aims to understand the fundamental implications of this condition based on extensive case studies. It turns out that the exactness of the SWKB quantization condition indicates the exact solvability of a system via the classical orthogonal polynomials. The SWKB quantization condition provides quantizations of energy, which we call the direct problem of the SWKB. We formulate the inverse problem of the SWKB: the problem of determining the superpotential from a given energy spectrum. The formulation successfully reconstructs all conventional shape-invariant potentials from the given energy spectra. We further construct novel solvable potentials, which are classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable, by this formulation. We further demonstrate several explicit solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable potentials, whose family is referred to as a harmonic oscillator with singularity functions in this thesis. In one case, the energy spectra become isospectral, with several additional eigenstates, to the ordinary harmonic oscillator for special choices of a parameter. By virtue of this, we formulate a systematic way of constructing infinitely many potentials that are strictly isospectral to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three main topics were raised in this discussion session, which took place on the 19th of June at the NumHyp-2015 meeting: nonlinear resonance for 1D systems of balance laws, dispersive extensions of standard hyperbolic conservation laws, and the validation of weakly dispersive shallow water wave models. An introductory overview with many bibliographic references is provided for all these topics. Based on kinetic formulation, a numerical strategy that can overcome resonance issues is presented, and a well-balanced (WB) technique for Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations is outlined. This WB scheme relies on the spectral representation of stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras in Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalent. From physical perspective, it is equivalent to say we give the criterion when different $E_2$ condensable algebras result in a same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon condensation process. By taking left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we can exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper gives a complete interplay between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C}\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$.
  The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated to their module categories, which corresponds to the domain walls in topological orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of domain walls. We also find an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may lead to a non-trivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite groups. We develop a lattice model depiction of $E_1$ condensable algebras, in which the role played by the left and right centers can be realized on a lattice model. Examples beyond group symmetries are also been discussed.
  The classification of condensable algebras and domain walls motive us to introduce some promising concepts such as categorical quantum entanglement. Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt equivalent modular tensor categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perceptive. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits and their stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space.</description>

      <title>A Moving Mesh Method for Porous Medium Equation by the Onsager Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving the porous medium equation using a moving mesh finite element method that leverages the Onsager variational principle as an approximation tool. Both the continuous and discrete problems are formulated based on the Onsager principle. The energy dissipation structure is maintained in the semi-discrete and fully implicit discrete schemes. We also develop a fully decoupled explicit scheme by which only a few linear equations are solved sequentially in each time step. The numerical schemes exhibit an optimal convergence rate when the initial mesh is appropriately selected to ensure accurate approximation of the initial data. Furthermore, the method naturally captures the waiting time phenomena without requiring any manual intervention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Hamiltonian aspects of the integro-differential kinetic equation for dense soliton gas which results as a thermodynamic limit of the Whitham equations. Under a delta-functional ansatz, the kinetic equation reduces to a non-diagonalisable system of hydrodynamic type whose matrix consists of several $2\times 2$ Jordan blocks. We demonstrate that the resulting system possesses local Hamiltonian structures of differential-geometric type, for all standard two-soliton interaction kernels (KdV, sinh-Gordon, hard-rod, Lieb-Liniger, DNLS, and separable cases). In the hard-rod case, we show that the continuum limit of these structures provides a local multi-Hamiltonian formulation of the full kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Scaled Brownian motion with random anomalous diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaled Brownian motion (SBM) is regarded as one of the paradigmatic random processes, featuring the anomalous diffusion property characterized by the diffusion exponent. It is a Gaussian, self-similar process with independent increments, which has found applications across various fields, from turbulence and stochastic hydrology to biophysics. In our paper, inspired by recent single particle tracking biological experiments, we introduce a process termed the scaled Brownian motion with random exponent (SBMRE), which preserves SBM characteristics at the level of individual trajectories, albeit with randomly varying anomalous diffusion exponents across the trajectories. We discuss the main probabilistic properties of SBMRE, including its probability density function (pdf), and the q-th absolute moment. Additionally, we present the expected value of the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) and the ergodicity breaking parameter. Furthermore, we analyze the pdf of the first hitting time in a semi-infinite domain, the martingale property of SBMRE, and its stochastic exponential. As special cases, we consider two distributions of the anomalous diffusion exponent, namely the two-point and beta distributions, and discuss the asymptotics of the presented characteristics in such cases.

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator with a Step and its Isospectral Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a harmonic oscillator with a finite jump $a$ at the origin. The solution is constructed by employing the ordinary matching-of-wavefunctions technique. For the special choices of $a$, $a=4\ell$ ($\ell=1,2,\ldots$), the wavefunctions can be expressed by the Hermite polynomials. Moreover, we explore isospectral deformations of the potential via the Darboux transformation. In this context, infinitely many isospectral Hamiltonians to the ordinary harmonic oscillator are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the generic slowing down of quantum dynamics in low energy density states of spatially local Hamiltonians. Beginning with quantum walks of a single particle, we prove that for certain classes of Hamiltonians (deformations of lattice-regularized $H\propto p^{2k}$), the ``butterfly velocity" of particle motion at low energies has an upper bound that must scale as $E^{(2k-1)/2k}$, as expected from dimensional analysis. We generalize these results to obtain bounds on the typical velocities of particles in many-body systems with repulsive interactions, where for certain families of Hubbard-like models we obtain similar scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence in point-gap topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A striking feature of non-Hermitian systems is the presence of two different types of topology. One generalizes Hermitian topological phases, and the other is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, which are called line-gap topology and point-gap topology, respectively. Whereas the bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in the former topology, its role in the latter has not been clear yet. This Letter establishes the bulk-boundary correspondence in the point-gap topology in non-Hermitian systems. After revealing the requirement for point-gap topology in the open boundary conditions, we clarify that the bulk point-gap topology in open boundary conditions can be different from that in periodic boundary conditions. On the basis of real space topological invariants and the $K$-theory, we give a complete classification of the open boundary point-gap topology with symmetry and show that the nontrivial open boundary topology results in robust and exotic surface states.</description>

      <title>Exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation has been proposed as a means to combat unwanted and unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing without the heavy resource overheads required by fault tolerant schemes. Recently, error mitigation has been successfully applied to reduce noise in near-term applications. In this work, however, we identify strong limitations to the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively `undone' for larger system sizes. Our framework rigorously captures large classes of error mitigation schemes in use today. By relating error mitigation to a statistical inference problem, we show that even at shallow circuit depths comparable to the current experiments, a superpolynomial number of samples is needed in the worst case to estimate the expectation values of noiseless observables, the principal task of error mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that scrambling due to noise can kick in at exponentially smaller depths than previously thought. They also impact other near-term applications, constraining kernel estimation in quantum machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms and ruling out exponential quantum speed-ups in estimating expectation values in the presence of noise or preparing the ground state of a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.</description>

      <title>The qudit Pauli group: non-commuting pairs, non-commuting sets, and structure theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qudits with local dimension $d&gt;2$ can have unique structure and uses that qubits ($d=2$) cannot. Qudit Pauli operators provide a very useful basis of the space of qudit states and operators. We study the structure of the qudit Pauli group for any, including composite, $d$ in several ways. To cover composite values of $d$, we work with modules over commutative rings, which generalize the notion of vector spaces over fields. For any specified set of commutation relations, we construct a set of qudit Paulis satisfying those relations. We also study the maximum size of sets of Paulis that mutually non-commute and sets that non-commute in pairs. Finally, we give methods to find near minimal generating sets of Pauli subgroups, calculate the sizes of Pauli subgroups, and find bases of logical operators for qudit stabilizer codes. Useful tools in this study are normal forms from linear algebra over commutative rings, including the Smith normal form, alternating Smith normal form, and Howell normal form of matrices. Possible applications of this work include the construction and analysis of qudit stabilizer codes, entanglement assisted codes, parafermion codes, and fermionic Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons with a statistical phase parameter $\alpha\in(0,2)$ are a kind of quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world. We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.</description>

  1. We give a complete classification of Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALF/AF gravitational instantons. This confirms a conjecture by Aksteiner-Andersson.
  2. We also show that such gravitational instantons can be compactified to toric log del Pezzo surfaces. This explains a curious relation between Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALF/AF gravitational instantons and compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds.
  3. We prove the non-existence of ALG and ALH type Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instantons.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB analysis for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics: Study of the Ai-Bender-Sarkar conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider exact WKB analysis to a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics defined by the potential, $V(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^2(i x)^{\varepsilon=2}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R} _{&gt; 0}$. We in particular aim to verify a conjecture proposed by Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS), that pertains to a relation between $D$-dimensional ${\cal PT}$-symmetric theories and analytic continuation (AC) of Hermitian theories concerning the energy spectrum or Euclidean partition function. For the purpose, we construct energy quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis and write down their transseries solution by solving the conditions. By performing alien calculus to the energy solutions, we verify validity of the ABS conjecture and seek a possibility of its alternative form by Borel resummation theory if it is violated. Our results claim that the validity of the ABS conjecture drastically changes depending on whether $\omega &gt; 0$ or $\omega = 0$: If ${\omega}&gt;0$, then the ABS conjecture is violated when exceeding the semi-classical level of the first non-perturbative order, but its alternative form is constructable by Borel resummation theory. The ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies are related to each other by a one-parameter Stokes automorphism, and a median resummed form, which corresponds to a formal exact solution, of the AC energy (resp. ${\cal PT}$ energy) is directly obtained by acting Borel resummation to a transseries solution of the ${\cal PT}$ energy (resp. AC energy). If $\omega = 0$, then, with respect to the inverse energy level-expansion, not only perturbative/non-perturbative structures of the ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies but also their perturbative parts do not match with each other. These energies are independent solutions, and no alternative form of the ABS conjecture can be reformulated by Borel resummation theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wanier Duality from Bilinear Phase Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Bilinear Phase Map (BPM), a concept that extends the Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights into relations between different quantum phases.</description>
