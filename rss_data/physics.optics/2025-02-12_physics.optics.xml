      <title>High-aspect-ratio silica meta-optics for high-intensity structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light and high-intensity ultrafast lasers are two rapidly advancing frontiers in photonics, yet their intersection remains largely unexplored. While ultrafast lasers continue to push the boundaries of peak intensities, structured light has enabled unprecedented control over light's spatial, temporal, and polarization properties. However, the lack of robust optical devices capable of bridging structured light with the high-intensity domain has constrained progress in combining these directions. Here, we demonstrate high-aspect-ratio silica meta-optics, which close this gap by combining silica's extraordinary damage resistance with the advanced phase and polarization control offered by metasurfaces. By leveraging anisotropic etching techniques, we fabricate nanopillars exceeding 3 $\mu$m in height with aspect ratios up to 14, enabling precise manipulation of complex light fields at intensities far beyond the thresholds of conventional metasurfaces. We showcase their functionality in generating vortex beams and achieving polarization manipulation with large phase retardance at challenging long-visible wavelengths. High-aspect-ratio silica meta-optics unlock structured laser-matter interactions in extreme regimes, that will surpass plasma ionization thresholds and enable applications such as relativistic particle acceleration and high-harmonic generation with structured beams, for both tabletop ultrafast systems and large-scale laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Elastically induced phase-shift and birefringence in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute how elastic deformations of optical fibers affect light propagation therein. Specifically, we consider differences in wave-guiding properties of straight fibers subject to different external temperatures, pressures, and gravitational fields. This is done by solving, perturbatively to first order, the Maxwell equations in deformed and anisotropic fibers using a multiple-scales approximation scheme. We derive explicit expressions for the induced phase shift and birefringence. The phase shift can be expressed in terms of the average radial pressure, longitudinal tension, and change in temperature, while birefringence depends on the quadrupole of the external pressure distribution and the stresses on the axis of the fiber.</description>

      <title>Virtual Critical Coupling in High-Power Resonant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciting high-power resonators pose challenges such as managing power reflections, which can cause energy losses and damage system components. This is crucial for applications like Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) systems in tokamaks, where plasma stability and confinement depend on efficient energy transfer. In this work, we introduce the Virtual Critical Coupling mechanism to address reflection-related challenges in S-band resonators. We theoretically designed a complex frequency excitation signal tailored to the resonator's characteristics, facilitating efficient energy storage and minimizing reflections without mechanical modifications. Using a custom low-level RF system, we conducted experiments at 32 mW and 600 kW with a 5 MW S-band klystron, demonstrating a ninefold reduction in reflection coefficients compared to traditional monochromatic excitation in high-power tests. This approach enhances the efficiency and stability of high-power resonant systems, potentially advancing nuclear fusion energy production.</description>

      <title>Effects of fractional diffraction on nonlinear PT phase transitions and stability of dark solitons and vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave propagation under the action of fractional diffraction has recently drawn increasing attention in nonlinear optics. Here, we address the effect of fractional diffraction on the existence, phase transitions, and stability of dark solitons (DSs) and vortices in parity-time (PT) symmetric graded-index waveguide with self-defocusing nonlinearity. The DSs and vortices are produced by numerical solution of the corresponding one- and two-dimensional fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We show that solution branches of fundamental and higher-order DSs collide pair-wise (merge) and disappear with the increase of the gain-loss strength, revealing nonlinear PT phase transitions in the waveguide. Numerically identifying the merger points, we demonstrate effects of the fractional diffraction on the phase transition.The phase transition points determine boundaries of existence regions for the DSs and vortices.The stability of the DSs and vortices is studied by means of the linearization with respect to small perturbations. Direct simulations of perturbed evolution corroborate their stability properties predicted by the analysis of small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Soliton microcombs in X-cut LiNbO3 microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-scale integration of optical frequency combs, particularly soliton microcombs, enables miniaturized instrumentation for timekeeping, ranging, and spectroscopy. Although soliton microcombs have been demonstrated on various material platforms, realizing complete comb functionality on photonic chips requires the co-integration of high-speed modulators and efficient frequency doublers, features that are available in a monolithic form on X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). However, the pronounced Raman nonlinearity associated with extraordinary light in this platform has so far precluded soliton microcomb generation. Here, we report the generation of transverse-electric-polarized soliton microcombs with a 25 GHz repetition rate in high-Q microresonators on X-cut TFLN chips. By precisely orienting the racetrack microresonator relative to the optical axis, we mitigate Raman nonlinearity and enable soliton formation under continuous-wave laser pumping. Moreover, the soliton microcomb spectra are extended to 350 nm with pulsed laser pumping. This work expands the capabilities of TFLN photonics and paves the way for the monolithic integration of fast-tunable, self-referenced microcombs.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Radiation from Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermal emitters that break the conventional Kirchhoff's law allow independent control of emissivity and absorptivity and promise exciting new functionalities in controlling heat flow for thermal and energy applications. In enabling some of these applications, nonreciprocal thermal emitters will unavoidably need to serve as hot emitters. Leveraging magneto-optical effects, degenerate semiconductors have been demonstrated as a promising optical material platform for nonreciprocal thermal radiation. However, existing modeling and experimental efforts are limited to near room temperature (&lt; 373 K), and it remains elusive whether nonreciprocal properties can persist at high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate strong nonreciprocal radiative properties at temperatures up to 600 K. We propose a theoretical model by considering the temperature dependence of the key parameters for the nonreciprocal behavior and experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the nonreciprocal properties of InAs, a degenerate semiconductor, using a customized angle-resolved high-temperature magnetic emissometry setup. Our theoretical model and experimental results show an agreement, revealing that strong nonreciprocity can persist at temperatures over 800 K for high-temperature stable semiconductors, enabling a pathway for nonreciprocal radiative heat flow control at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>An approach for improving the distorted structured light in holographic optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have been widely used for optical manipulation of various particles. At present, there are different type of optical tweezers. Among them, holographic optical tweezers have attracted growing attention as a powerful tools for optical trapping, optical transportation and optical sorting in many fields, due to its excellent properties including great flexibility and high convenience. Experimentally, however, the structured light has been easily distorted, which would lead to serious degradation of optical manipulation performance. In this work, the distortion of structured light is theoretically analyzed. In the following, the distortion of structured light are numerically simulated and experimentally measured. It shows that the simulated results are in consistent with the experimental ones. Then, an approach for decreasing its optical distortion is proposed, and the results reveal that the distortion of structured light can be effectively corrected. Accordingly, our study provides a way for improving the distorted structured light, which is useful for optically manipulating various particles in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy for imaging of localized optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy aims for imaging transient phenomena occurring on nanoscale. One of its goals is to visualize localized optical and plasmonic modes generated by coherent excitation in the vicinity of various types of nanostructures. Such imaging capability was enabled by photon-induced near-field optical microscopy, which is based on spectral filtering of electrons inelastically scattered due to the stimulated interaction with the near-field. Here we report on the development of ultrafast 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, which allows us to image the transverse components of the optical near-field while avoiding the need of electron spectral filtering. We demonstrate that this method is capable of imaging optical near-fields of a tungsten nanotip and ponderomotive potential of an optical standing wave with a spatial resolution of 21 nm.</description>

      <title>Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Dual-Frequency Comb in Fiber Fabry-Perot Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to dual-frequency comb generation utilizing a single fiber Fabry-Perot resonator, advancing the implementation of these sources in fiber-based systems. Dual-comb applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, and imaging, known for their high-resolution and rapid data acquisition capabilities, benefit significantly from the stability and coherence of optical frequency comb sources. Our method leverages the birefringent property of the resonator induced by the optical fiber to generate two orthogonally polarized optical frequency combs in a monolitic resonator. This approach allows for the generation of two different frequency combs with slightly different repetition rates, exhibiting excellent mutual coherence, making it highly relevant for dual-comb applications. The 40 nm bandwidth generated combs are induced by switching-waves in a normal dispersion fiber Fabry-Perot resonator. These comb types have the advantage of being easily generated by a pulse pumping scheme, which is employed in this study. Finally, the potential of the source is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept spectroscopy measurement.</description>

      <title>Decay Rates of Optical Modes Unveil the Island Structures in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the decay rates of optical modes in asymmetric microcavities with mixed phase space across a wide range of wavelengths that extend deep into the semiclassical, i.e., short-wavelength limit. Implementing an efficient numerical method, we computed 1000000 eigenmodes and discovered that certain decay rates form sequential separate branches with increasing wavenumber that eventually merge into smooth curves. The analysis of the localization properties and Husimi distributions reveals that each branch corresponds to a periodic orbit in the closed classical system. Our findings show that these decay rates gradually resolve the structure of the islands in mixed phase space as we approach the short-wavelength limit. We present an effective semiclassical model incorporating wavenumber-dependent localization, Fresnel reflection, and the Goos-Haenchen shift and demonstrate that these effects are crucial in accounting for the observed branches of decay rate curves.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable momentum space polarization singularities in liquid crystal microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum space polarization singularities of light appear as vectorial twists in the scattered and radiated far field patterns of exotic photonic structures. They relate to important concepts such as bound states in the continuum, spatiotemporal light steering, polarization M\"obius strips, Berry curvature and associated topological photonic phenomena. Polarization singularities, such as completely circularly polarized C-points, are readily designed in real space through interference of differently polarized beams. In momentum space, they require instead sophisticated patterning of photonic crystal slabs of reduced symmetries in order to appear in the corresponding band structure with scarce in-situ tunability. Here, we show that momentum space singularities can be generated and, importantly, electrically tuned in the band structure of a highly birefringent planar liquid crystal microcavity that retains many symmetries. Our results agree with theoretical predictions and offer exciting possibilities for integration of momentum space polarization singularities in spinoptronic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atomic clouds constitute highly resonant nonlinear optical media, whose refractive index can be easily tuned via the light frequency. When subjected to a retro-reflected laser beam and under appropriate conditions, the cloud undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking and spatial patterns develop in the transverse cross-section of the beam. We investigate the impact of the sign of the light detuning from the atomic resonance on these patterns, thus directly comparing pattern formation for self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. Our observations emphasize the need for a ''diffractively thick'' medium description of the light-cloud interaction, where diffraction and nonlinear propagation inside the sample are taken into account.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of determining the magnitude of neutral atom density in hydrogen plasma was investigated using Paschen-Back effect and resonant Faraday rotation of the polarization plane of light by residual neutral atoms in the plasma. In strong magnetic fields when the Zeeman shift is greater than the distance of the hyperfine structure energy levels the Paschen-Back effect is observed. In this case, it is no longer possible to speak about the independence of the splitting of each level of a given multiplet term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are spin-dependent phenomena critical to optoelectronics. The dynamics of spin populations during geminate triplet pair separation are crucial for controlling fission and TTA rates. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induces level crossings between spin manifolds, affecting spin populations and TTA rates in crystalline fission semiconductors. By investigating spin-dependent fluorescence in a triplet exciton pair with the magnetic field aligned along the fine structure tensor, we isolate the effect of DMI, as the triplet wavefunctions remain unaffected by the field. Our results reveal that DMI introduces additional TTA pathways that are forbidden by spin conservation, explaining the observed evolution of optically detected magnetic resonance signals with varying magnetic field. This study highlights the significant impact of DMI on the optical properties of triplet excitons, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Fingerprint Matrix Concept for Detecting, Localizing and Characterizing Targets in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes a full blurring of the image beyond a transport mean free path. Here, we show how to detect, localize, and characterize any scattering target through the reflection matrix of the complex medium in which this target is embedded and thus hidden from direct view. More precisely, we introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. Applied to the recorded reflection matrix, this operator provides a likelihood index of the target in any given state, despite the scattering fog induced by the surrounding environment. This state can be the target position for localization purposes, its shape for characterization, or any other parameter that influences the target response. Our concept is versatile and broadly applicable to different type of waves for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured. We demonstrate this here explicitly by performing different proof-of-concept experiments with ultrasound on targets buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension, on lesion markers for clinical applications, and on the architecture of muscle tissue.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic resonance energy transfer with strained phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of optical tweezers form the backbone of neutral atoms analog and digital quantum processors. However, the inter-trap distance remains generally much larger than the size of the tweezers to avoid interference-induced trap distortions, limiting the trap density. Here, we report single-atom trapping in four super-resolved tweezers, meaning with a separation below the Sparrow diffraction limit. The optical pattern is generated using superoscillatory phenomenon leading to subwavelength traps with full control of the trap relative phases. We investigate two sets of relative phases that impede or allow the hopping and the reshuffling of atoms. We envision that superoscillatory light structuring will bridge the gap between large-distance traps generated by tweezer arrays and short-distance traps formed with optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense light-field can dress both Bloch electrons inside crystals and photo-emitted free electrons in the vacuum, dubbed as Floquet and Volkov states respectively. These quantum states can further interfere coherently, modulating light-field dressed states. Here, we report experimental evidence of the Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor - black phosphorus. A highly asymmetric modulation of the spectral weight is observed for the Floquet-Volkov states, and such asymmetry can be further controlled by rotating the pump polarization. Our work reveals the quantum interference between different light-field dressed electronic states, providing insights for material engineering on the ultrafast timescale.</description>

      <title>Extended monocular 3D imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D vision is of paramount importance for numerous applications ranging from machine intelligence to precision metrology. Despite much recent progress, the majority of 3D imaging hardware remains bulky and complicated and provides much lower image resolution compared to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, there are many well-known scenarios that existing 3D imaging solutions frequently fail. Here, we introduce an extended monocular 3D imaging (EM3D) framework that fully exploits the vectorial wave nature of light. Via the multi-stage fusion of diffraction- and polarization-based depth cues, using a compact monocular camera equipped with a diffractive-refractive hybrid lens, we experimentally demonstrate the snapshot acquisition of a million-pixel and accurate 3D point cloud for extended scenes that are traditionally challenging, including those with low texture, being highly reflective, or nearly transparent, without a data prior. Furthermore, we discover that the combination of depth and polarization information can unlock unique new opportunities in material identification, which may further expand machine intelligence for applications like target recognition and face anti-spoofing. The straightforward yet powerful architecture thus opens up a new path for a higher-dimensional machine vision in a minimal form factor, facilitating the deployment of monocular cameras for applications in much more diverse scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of induced localized coupled modes in passive cavities with both loss and gain. Our model is based on linearly coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations, where a Gaussian pump beam is applied to only one mode. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that self-defocusing systems can support the formation of localized stationary modes in the partner field. The characteristics of these induced modes are determined by key parameters, including coupling strength, cavity decay rate, detuning effects, and the pump beam's intensity and width.</description>

Abstract: We measured the covariance matrix of the fields generated in an integrated third-order optical parametric oscillator operating above threshold. We observed up to $(2.3 \pm 0.3)$ dB of squeezing in amplitude difference, inferred $(4.9 \pm 0.7)$ dB of on-chip squeezing, while an excess of noise for the sum of conjugated quadratures hinders the entanglement. The degradation of amplitude correlations and state purity for the increasing of the pump power is consistent with the observed growth of the phase noise of the fields, showing the necessity of strategies for phase noise control aiming at entanglement generation in these systems.</description>

      <title>Low thermal noise mirror coatings utilising titanium dioxide and germanium dioxide mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upgrades to ground-based gravitational-wave observatories will require mirror coatings with reduced thermal noise, enabling improved detector sensitivity and extended astrophysical reach. Recent studies have shown that optical coatings utilising amorphous materials that exhibit a larger fraction of corner-sharing between adjacent structural units of metal-centered polyhedra are a promising route for reducing mechanical dissipation and thus thermal noise at room temperature. We report on multilayer optical coatings that are fabricated using germanium dioxide mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$) for the high index layers, and silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) for the low index material. Single layers of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ are characterised to optimise the mixture proportion and based on that highly reflective multilayer stacks were deposited. Exceptional optical absorption at 1064 nm below 1 part-per-million (ppm) is observed in the multilayer stacks after heat treatment. The annealing process also induces the formation of blisters which leads to increased optical scattering. However, there is indication that blisters can be suppressed by decreasing the water partial pressure in the deposition chamber. Direct thermal noise measurements provide experimental verification of a significant 25\% reduction of thermal noise over the mirrors currently employed, which combined with sub-ppm levels of optical absorption show the potential of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear optics lies at the heart of classical and quantum light generation. The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light penetration depth in biological tissue is limited by tissue scattering. Correcting scattering becomes particularly challenging in scenarios with limited photon availability and when access to the transmission side of the scattering tissue is not possible. Here, we introduce a new two-photon microscopy system with Fourier-domain intensity coupling for scattering correction (2P-FOCUS). 2P-FOCUS corrects scattering by intensity modulation in the Fourier domain, leveraging the nonlinearity of multiple-beam interference and two-photon excitation, eliminating the need for a guide star, iterative optimization, or measuring transmission or reflection matrices. 2P-FOCUS uses random patterns to probe scattering properties, combined with a single-shot algorithm to rapidly generate the correction mask. 2P-FOCUS can also correct scattering beyond the limitation of the memory effect by automatically customizing correction masks for each subregion in a large field-of-view. We provide several proof-of-principle demonstrations here, including focusing and imaging through a bone sample, and imaging neurons and cerebral blood vessels in the mouse brain ex vivo. 2P-FOCUS significantly enhances two-photon fluorescence signals by several tens of folds compared to cases without scattering correction at the same excitation power. 2P-FOCUS can also correct tissue scattering over a 230x230x500 um\textsuperscript{3} volume, which is beyond the memory effect range. 2P-FOCUS is able to measure, calculate, and correct scattering within a few seconds, effectively delivering more light deep into the scattering tissue. 2P-FOCUS could be broadly adopted for deep tissue imaging owing to its powerful combination of effectiveness, speed, and cost.</description>

      <title>Efficient transverse multi-wave interactions up to six-wave mixing in a high-Q lithium niobate microresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order nonlinear optical processes beyond four-wave mixing serve as fundamental tools for advancing photonic technologies, yet their practical implementation remains challenging due to stringent phase-matching requirements and inherently weak high-order nonlinear susceptibilities - limitations that persist even in state-of-the-art high-Q microresonators. In this work, we demonstrate a breakthrough in synthesizing transverse nonlinear processes up to six-wave mixing in an integrated lithium niobate microresonator, under single continuous-wave (CW) telecom-band laser pump. Our approach leverages self-organized subwavelength photorefractive gratings (SPGs) generated through bidirectional stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process in the microresonator, without using two external counterpropagating lasers. Under 1546 nm pumping, bidirectional SRS at 1713 nm creates two counterpropagating light waves that spontaneously form SPGs. These SPGs critically enable broadband phase-matching compensation across 500 nm spectral range by providing additional momentum matching for transverse nonlinear processes while maintaining ultrahigh-Q factor. Moreover, cascaded SRS process is simultaneously activated to generate light signal for subsequent nonlinear interactions. This novel approach enables, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of single-pump phase-matched transverse sum-frequency generation (SFG) with record conversion efficiency (590%/W). Furthermore, transverse multi-wave mixing processes from four-wave to six-wave mixing processes are achieved with high conversion efficiencies for the first time using only the single CW pump, representing a notable advance in nonlinear integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel reflection-mode diffraction tomography technique that enables simultaneous recovery of forward and backward scattering information for high-resolution 3D refractive index reconstruction. Our technique works by imaging a sample on a highly reflective substrate and employing a novel multiple-scattering model and reconstruction algorithm. It combines the modified Born series as the forward model, Bloch and perfect electric conductor boundary conditions to handle oblique incidence and substrate reflections, and the adjoint method for efficient gradient computation in solving the inverse-scattering problem. We validate the technique through simulations and experiments, achieving accurate reconstructions in samples with high refractive index contrasts and complex geometries. Forward scattering captures smooth axial features, while backward scattering reveals complementary interfacial details. Experimental results on dual-layer resolution targets, 3D randomly distributed beads, phase structures obscured by highly scattering fibers, fixed breast cancer cells, and fixed \emph{C. elegans} demonstrate its robustness and versatility. This technique holds promise for applications in semiconductor metrology and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Hearing carrier-envelope offset frequency and phase in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond science and frequency metrology rely on the precise measurement and control of the laser pulse waveform, a feat traditionally achieved using optoelectronic techniques. In this study, we conducted a laser-induced acoustic experiment in air ionized by carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. Our results reveal that the acoustic signal exhibits CEP dependence in few-cycle pulses, primarily through amplitude modulation from laser-driven ionization. This novel optoacoustic phenomenon enables not only the measurement of the carrier-envelope offset frequency but also the direct characterization of the waveform of optical pulses through a microphone. Our study highlights the potential of laser-induced acoustic waves for advancing frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Ultra-narrow linewidth light generation based on an optoelectronic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth light sources are essential for both fundamental research and various technological applications, yet they are challenging to generate directly due to instabilities in active laser cavities and the misalignment between closely spaced resonator modes and broad gain bandwidth. In this study, we demonstrate the direct generation of low-noise light from an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). By minimizing the delay in the optoelectronic link and employing a high-quality optical resonator, an OEO can simultaneously generate both a low-phase-noise optical oscillation that is resilient to phase fluctuations of its pump laser, and a radio frequency (RF) oscillation that captures these fluctuations. We leverage these RF-domain fluctuations to implement a high-performance feedback loop, which stabilizes the pump laser and significantly enhances the performance of optical oscillation. This approach achieves an outstanding phase noise level of -100 dBc/Hz at a 1 kHz offset and an integrated linewidth as narrow as 0.23 Hz. The integration of optoelectronic oscillation and feedback loop provides significant broadband noise suppression compared to conventional schemes for generating narrow-linewidth light, paving the way for developments in fields such as coherent optical communications, atomic spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Integrated electronic controller for dynamic self-configuration of photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can implement arbitrary operations and signal processing functionalities directly in the optical domain. Run-time configuration of these circuits requires an electronic control layer to adjust the working point of their building elements and make them compensate for thermal drifts or degradations of the input signal. As the advancement of photonic foundries enables the fabrication of chips of increasing complexity, developing scalable electronic controllers becomes crucial for the operation of complex PICs. In this paper, we present an electronic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for reconfiguration of PICs featuring numerous tuneable elements. Each channel of the ASIC controller independently addresses one optical component of the PIC, as multiple parallel local feedback loops are operated to achieve full control. The proposed design is validated through real-time reconfiguration of a 16-channel silicon photonics adaptive beam coupler. Results demonstrate automatic coupling of an arbitrary input beam to a single-mode waveguide, dynamic compensation of beam wavefront distortions and successful transmission of a 50 Gbit/s signal through an optical free-space link. The low power consumption and compactness of the electronic chip provide a scalable paradigm that can be seamlessly extended to larger photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Open transmission channels in multimode fiber cavities with random mode mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of light in disordered media is governed by open transmission channels, which enable nearly complete transmission of the incident power, despite low average transmission. Extensively studied in diffusive media and chaotic cavities, open channels exhibit unique properties such as universal spatial structure and extended dwell times. However, their experimental study is challenging due to the large number of modes required for control and measurement. We propose a multimode fiber cavity (MMFC) as a platform to explore open channels. Leveraging mode confinement and finite angular spread, MMFCs enable a full control over all channels. This allowed us to achieve an 18-fold power enhancement by selectively exciting an open channel with a transmission rate of $0.90 \pm 0.04$. By analyzing 100 transmission matrices of MMFC realizations, we observed a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution, indicating high channel control and low losses. The scalability of MMFCs, combined with long dwell times and potential for nonlinear phenomena, offers new opportunities for studying complex wave transport.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Cell Wall Heterogeneity for Aspergillus Fumigatus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) enables nanoscale chemical mapping of biological structures, providing high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio imaging into molecular distribution and interactions beyond the capabilities of conventional Raman imaging. However, challenges such as the deformation of fragile biological cells and the complexity of signal interpretation would increase the difficulty in investigating biological samples with TERS. Here, we demonstrate using TERS to investigate the cell wall heterogeneity of Aspergillus fumigatus spores. Using TERS imaging and spectral analysis, we map the chemical components including melanin within the fungal cell wall. The results reveal distinct spectral features associated with polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins. Furthermore, by comparing the wild-type and albino mutant spores, we illuminate the biochemical characteristics of Dihydroxynaphthalene melanin (DHN-melanin) in the fungal cell wall.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy-breaking and Long-lived Multimode Microwave Electromechanical Systems Enabled by Cubic Silicon-Carbide Membrane Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cubic silicon-carbide crystals (3C-SiC), known for their high thermal conductivity and in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality ($Q$) mechanical oscillators. We reveal degeneracy-breaking phenomena in 3C-phase crystalline silicon-carbide membrane and present high-$Q$ mechanical modes in pairs or clusters. The 3C-SiC material demonstrates excellent microwave compatibility with superconducting circuits. Thus, we can establish a coherent electromechanical interface, enabling precise control over 21 high-$Q$ mechanical modes from a single 3C-SiC square membrane. Benefiting from extremely high mechanical frequency stability, this interface enables tunable light slowing with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of \emph{an hour}. Coherent energy transfer between distinct mechanical modes are also presented. In this work, the studied 3C-SiC membrane crystal with their significant properties of multiple acoustic modes and high-quality factors, provide unique opportunities for the encoding, storage, and transmission of quantum information via bosonic phonon channels.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection of time-dependent dielectric structure: Rayleigh's limit and quantum vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. Such imaging normally holds Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field zone. We show that time-modulation of an inhomogeneous dielectric can be used to determine its susceptibility. To this end, we focus on the inverse quantum optics problem for spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. We show that the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies even in the far-field zone. Hence, certain dielectric features can be determined without radiating any incident field on the dielectric. When the incident light is scattered (or re-radiated), the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and overcomes Rayleigh's limit in the far-field zone. We study similar effects for an inhomogeneous dielectric moving with a constant speed, a problem we consider within relativistic optics. Now the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal reflects dielectric features, can be long-range in space but is not a far-field effect.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme allowing coherent shaping, i.e., controlling both the amplitude and phase, of attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the Wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production and control of phase-stable pulse trains using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source II.</description>

      <title>Towards Single-Lens Controllable Depth-of-Field Imaging via Depth-Aware Point Spread Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field. The source code and the established dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DCDI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.</description>
