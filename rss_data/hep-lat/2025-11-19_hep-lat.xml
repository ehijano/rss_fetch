      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest and next-to-nearest interactions on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest $J_1$ and next-to-nearest $J_2$ interactions on the triangular lattice for $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0. The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of the Self-Renormalized Nucleon Gluon PDF in Large-Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using the self-renormalized large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) approach in lattice QCD. This work extends previous gluon-PDF extractions by performing a detailed analysis of key systematic effects, including gauge-link smearing, lattice spacing, pion mass, and nucleon boost momentum. The self-renormalization framework mitigates ultraviolet divergences associated with Wilson-line self-energy and renormalon contributions by combining lattice matrix elements with perturbative short-distance information, thereby preserving the correct infrared structure. Calculations are performed on $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three lattice spacings and two pion masses, with boosted nucleon states reaching momenta up to 2.2~GeV. We determine renormalization factors from zero-momentum matrix elements and apply hybrid renormalization to suppress discretization artifacts. After extrapolating large-separation behavior and performing Fourier transforms, we reconstruct quasi-PDFs and match them to lightcone PDFs using next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. Our results demonstrate that smearing and lattice-spacing effects are under control, and pion-mass and lattice-spacing dependence is mild relative to the current $O(10^6)$ statistics; however, momentum dependence remains a significant source of uncertainty. Future work including even larger boost momenta will be essential to reduce systematics in lattice determinations of the gluon PDF and to advance toward precision QCD phenomenology at the LHC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Cluster phenomena using few-body and Lattice QCD theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of first-principles calculations for baryon-baryon interactions, it becomes possible to obtain reliable hyperon-nucleon potentials by lattice QCD simulations with the HAL QCD method. High-precision few-body methods, such as the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), are applicable to solve quantum few-body systems up to four- and five-body systems. By combining the HAL QCD potentials with the GEM, one can predict the level structure of novel hypernuclei prior to experimental observation. In this review, we utilize the lattice QCD $N\Xi$ potential obtained by the HAL QCD method to investigate the few-body systems $NN\Xi$ and $NNN\Xi$. Our analysis indicates that the lightest bound $\Xi$ hypernucleus is the $NNN\Xi$ system. To extract detailed information on the isospin and spin components of the $N\Xi$ interaction, we perform a four-body calculation for the $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ system with the total isospin $T = 0$ and $T = 1$. We demonstrate that the level structure of this system is sensitive to the isospin and spin dependencies of the $N\Xi$ interaction. Furthermore, we propose experimental investigations to produce the $NNN\Xi$ and $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ systems via the $(K^-, K^+)$ and $(K^-, K^0)$ reactions on $^4$He and $^{10}$B targets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Matching Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Simulations in (2+1)-dimensional U(1) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At finite lattice spacing, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian predictions differ due to discretization effects. In the Hamiltonian limit, i.e. at vanishing temporal lattice spacing $a_t$, the path integral approach in the Lagrangian formalism reproduces the results of the Hamiltonian theory. In this work, we numerically calculate the Hamiltonian limit of a U$(1)$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This is achieved by Monte Carlo simulations in the Lagrangian formalism with lattices that are anisotropic in the time direction. For each ensemble, we determine the ratio between the temporal and spatial scale with the static quark potential and extrapolate to $a_t \to 0$. Our results are compared with the data from Hamiltonian simulations at small volumes, showing agreement within $&lt;2\sigma$. These results can be used to match the two formalisms.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Entanglement Geometry by Structural Optimization of Tree Tensor Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess exact structures that resemble integrability, with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such structures live in the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and are based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes, have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite-dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle S^1 to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD, they are color singlets and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and eigenvalue dynamics of stochastic gradient descent in multilayer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.</description>
