      <title>Thermal Endurance of Suspended Thin-Film Lithium Niobate up to 800 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for high-temperature piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) requires pushing piezoelectric platforms to their thermal limits. In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 $^\circ$C and 800 $^\circ$C, with 50 $^\circ$C temperature increments. Fundamental symmetric (S0) mode acoustic resonators are fabricated on 600 nm stoichiometric LN (sLN) with 40 nm thick platinum top electrodes and a thin titanium adhesion layer. After each annealing round, changes in the devices' resonant frequency and quality factor (\emph{Q}) are quantitatively studied. The devices and material stack are further analyzed with resistivity structures, optical microscope images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Temperature Swing and Rectifying Radiative Heat Transfer for Passive Dynamic Space Thermal Control with Variable-Emittance Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic radiative thermal control is crucial for normal operation and energy saving of spacecraft that copes with changing thermal environment involving heat dissipation to cold deep space, external heating from the Sun and nearby planet, and internal heating from onboard electronics. Variable-emittance coatings, whose infrared emittance can be tuned passively by temperature or actively by external stimuli, could provide a viable solution. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate self-adaptive dynamic radiative heat transfer with variable-emittance coating based on thermochromic VO2 in space-like thermal environment with a coldfinger and a custom-made sample mount inside a vacuum cryostat. Black Actar and highly reflective tungsten mirror are used to calibrate the parasitic head load and heat flux sensor sensitivity, while multiple static-emittance samples made of silicon wafers with different doping levels are measured for validation of the experimental method and for direct comparison with the variable-emittance VO2 coating. With the coldfinger at 80 K to mimic external radiative scenarios in space, the tunable coating exhibits 6-fold enhancement in radiative thermal conductance upon VO2 phase transition for promoted heat dissipation, in addition to reduced temperature swing by almost 20degC compared to the static emitters. With the coldfinger at 25degC as internal radiative scenarios in space, similar 6-fold heat dissipation from the variable-emittance coating is also observed, while radiative heat transfer is much suppressed with a constant radiative thermal conductance when the coldfinger is hotter than the tunable coating at 25degC, leading to a thermal rectification factor of 1.8 experimentally achieved.</description>

      <title>A Study on Optimizing the Thermal Performance of Coaxial Heat Exchanger Systems in Medium-Deep Geothermal Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium-deep geothermal energy is a key renewable source, but existing coaxial downhole heat exchanger (DHE) systems suffer from low efficiency and temperature decay. This study evaluates the impacts of circulating flow rate, inlet temperature, and operation mode on DHE performance, using field data from two geothermal wells (Well A: 3200m, 130.5$^{\circ}$C; Well B: 2500m, 103.3$^{\circ}$C). Results show that under an optimal condition (LC3: 50 m$^3$/h, 30$^{\circ}$C), Well A's heat extraction rate increased from 35% to 42%, with its outlet temperature rising from 15$^{\circ}$C to 20$^{\circ}$C. In contrast, Well B's rate decreased from 15% to 5%. After one week of continuous operation, the outlet temperature of Well A dropped from 55.7$^{\circ}$C to 16.5$^{\circ}$C, and Well B's from 68$^{\circ}$C to 17$^{\circ}$C. Adopting an intermittent mode (16h operation, 8h shutdown daily) reduced the temperature decay rate by approximately 10%. Based on these findings, we propose optimization strategies: controlling flow rate to 35m$^3$/h, maintaining an inlet temperature of 6--10$^{\circ}$C, and implementing intermittent scheduling. This work provides guidance for the efficient design and sustainable operation of DHE systems.</description>

      <title>Unified Spatiotemopral Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL): A Framework for Modeling Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</description>

      <title>Tunable Random Telegraph Noise in Stable Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for Unconventional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that thermally stable perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), widely used in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory, can be actuated with nanosecond pulses to exhibit tunable stochastic behavior. This actuated-stochastic tunnel junction (A-sMTJ) concept produces random telegraph noise, with control over fluctuation rate and probability bias. The device response is shown to be consistent with a Poisson process, with fluctuation rates tunable over more than two orders of magnitude, with average state dwell times varying from 29 ns to greater than 2.3 microseconds. These results establish A-sMTJs as a versatile platform for integrating deterministic, stochastic, and in-memory functionality on a single chip, advancing the development of probabilistic, neuromorphic, and unconventional computing systems.</description>

      <title>Superparamagnetic and Stochastic-Write Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for High-Speed True Random Number Generation in Advanced Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review two magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) approaches for compact, low-power, CMOS-integrated true random number generation (TRNG). The first employs passive-read, easy-plane superparamagnetic MTJs (sMTJs) that generate thermal-fluctuation-driven bit streams at $0.5$--$1$~Gb/s per device. The second uses MTJs with magnetically stable free layers, operated with stochastic write pulses to achieve switching probabilities of about $0.5$ (\emph{i.e.}, write error rates of $\simeq 0.5$), achieving $\gtrsim 0.1$~Gb/s per device; we refer to these as stochastic-write MTJs (SW-MTJs). Randomness from both approaches has been validated using the NIST~SP800 test suites. The sMTJ approach uses a read-only cell with low power and can be compatible with most advanced CMOS nodes, while SW-MTJs leverage standard CMOS MTJ process flows, enabling co-integration with embedded spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Both approaches can achieve deep sub-0.01~$\mu$m$^2$ MTJ footprints and offer orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency than CPU/GPU-based generators, enabling placement near logic for high-throughput random bit-streams for probabilistic computing, statistical modeling, and cryptography. In terms of performance, sMTJs generally suit applications requiring very high data-rate random bits near logic processors, such as probabilistic computing or large-scale statistical modeling. By contrast, SW-MTJs are an attractive option for edge-oriented microcontrollers, providing entropy sources for computing or cryptographic enhancement. We highlight the strengths, limitations, and integration challenges of each approach, emphasizing the need to reduce device-to-device variability in sMTJs -- particularly by mitigating magnetostriction-induced in-plane anisotropy -- and to improve temporal stability in SW-MTJs for robust, large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Scale Up Analysis of Inductively Heated Metamaterial Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductively heated metamaterial reactors, which utilize an open cell lattice baffle structure as a heating susceptor for magnetic induction, are promising candidates for scaled electrified thermochemical reactor operation due to their ability to support volumetric heating profiles and enhanced heat transfer properties. In this work, we present a systematic scale up analysis of inductive metamaterial reactors where we utilize a combination of analytic modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments to project the capabilities and performance of scaled reactors. We use reverse water gas shift as a model reaction system and show that for reactor configurations featuring a uniform metamaterial susceptor, the total system efficiency increases with scale. However, the throughput of these scaled reactors is limited by radial temperature gradients. We further show this bottleneck can be overcome by tailoring the radial effective conductivity profile of the susceptor, which can enable scaled reactors with nearly ideal plug flow-like capabilities. These concepts provide a pathway towards scaled electrified thermochemical reactors with optimal chemical conversion capabilities.</description>

      <title>A 5.9 GHz Sezawa SAW Acoustic Delay Line Based on Al0.6Sc0.4N-on-Sapphire with Propagation Q-factor &gt; 3,000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct measurement of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental bubble number density values.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.</description>
