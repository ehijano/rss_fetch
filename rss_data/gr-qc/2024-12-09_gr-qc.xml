      <title>Quasinormal Modes and GUP-Corrected Hawking Radiation of BTZ Black Holes within Modified Gravity Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and effective potential profiles of massless and rotating BTZ black holes within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) modified gravity theories, which, while producing similar space-time structures, exhibit variations due to distinct cosmological constants, $\Lambda_m$. We derive wave equations for these black hole perturbations and analyze the behavior of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}(r)$ under different values of mass $m$, cosmological constant $\Lambda_m$, and modified gravity parameters $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\gamma$. The findings indicate that increasing mass and parameter values results in a raised potential barrier, implying stronger confinement of perturbations and impacting black hole stability. Incorporating the generalized uncertainty principle, we also study its effect on the thermodynamics of rotating BTZ black holes, demonstrating how GUP modifies black hole radiation, potentially observable in QNM decay rates. Additionally, we investigate the motion of particles through null and timelike geodesics in static BTZ space-time, observing asymptotic behaviors for null geodesics and parameter-dependent shifts in potential for timelike paths. The study concludes that modified gravity parameters significantly influence QNM frequencies and effective potential profiles, offering insights into black hole stability and suggesting that these theoretical predictions may be tested through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Cooling of Neutron Stars through Emission of Neutrinos and Photons: Effects of Modified Gravity and Magnetic Field using TOV Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of dark matter has long been extensively studied in the past few decades. In this study, we investigate the emission of neutrinos and photons from neutron stars (NSs) by employing the modified theory of gravity and the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) system of equations. The extreme matter density and magnetic field inside the NSs provide a unique laboratory for studying fundamental physics, including the interplay between gravity and quantum field effects. The impact of a strong magnetic field has also been incorporated into the corresponding TOV equations. We here attempt to see how neutrinos and photons emissions from these compact objects are impacted by the modified TOV equations due to modified theory of gravity; f(R,T) gravity or scalar-tensor theory and strong magnetic fields. Our analysis focuses on how these modifications influence the structure, cooling, and photon/neutrino luminosities of NS. We computed the surface temperature of NSs for normal Einstein gravity and modified gravity theories with and without magnetic field for three EoSs; namely APR, FPS and SLY. On comparison of our predicted values of surface temperature with the observed surface temperature for three NSs, we find that modified gravity along with inside magnetic field-based predictions shows reasonable agreement with the corresponding observed values.</description>

      <title>Myrzakulov Gravity in Vielbein Formalism: A Study in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to understand gravity's role in shaping the universe has led to the exploration of modified gravity theories. One such theory is Myrzakulov gravity, which incorporates both curvature and torsion. In this work, we investigate the effects of torsion within the framework of $f(R,T)$-gravity, a modification of General Relativity that includes both curvature and torsion. We present this theory in the Vielbein formalism, which offers a more flexible, geometric perspective on gravity. This formalism is particularly useful in Weitzenb"ock spacetime, where torsion significantly influences gravitational interactions. Our study aims to extend Myrzakulov's theory and explore its cosmological and astrophysical implications. We examine the effects of torsion on phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves, and neutron stars. These modifications could lead to observable deviations in black hole thermodynamics, gravitational wave propagation, and dense matter structure. This work provides new insights into the nature of spacetime and gravity, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental forces governing the cosmos. It paves the way for future studies, both observational and theoretical, that could reveal new physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>The merger of a black hole with a cosmological horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there have been many studies on exactly solvable black hole mergers, based on a model by Emparan and Martinez where the mass of one black hole is blown up to infinity. Here we replace the large black hole by a cosmological horizon, and study how it merges with a black hole in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime by considering an observer positioned at future null infinity. We describe the geometry of the horizon over time, including the role that caustics play in the merger process, and also examine the growth of the horizon area. We argue that in the limit of zero cosmological constant, the system reduces to the Emparan-Martinez Schwarzschild merger. This allows us to regularise the increase in the area during the merger, which otherwise diverges.</description>

      <title>Performance of iDQ ahead of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors used by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and the Virgo Collaboration are incredibly sensitive instruments which frequently detect non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise transients. iDQ is a statistical inference framework which leverages the use of auxiliary degrees of freedom monitored in the detectors to identify such transients. In this work, we describe the improvements to the iDQ pipeline made between the third and fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, and show the performance of these changes. We find that iDQ detects a total of 39,398 of the known 100,512 glitches identified by Omicron over the course of the second half of the third observing run. We construct a measure of the probability a glitch is present in the strain data of a given detector by combining information from iDQ and Omicron as well as extend the output of iDQ in a novel method which finds correlations between known glitch classifications, and auxiliary channels. We identify several channels over the course of O3b which frequently record instances of Scattered Light, Whistle, and Blip glitches and discuss use cases for this method in active observing runs.</description>

      <title>A bimetric cosmological model based on Andrei Sakharov's twin universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy ({\Lambda}CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for he presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Theory: generalizations to higher dimensions, supersymmetry and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity in its Hamiltonian form relies on a connection formulation of the gravitational phase space with three key properties: 1.) a compact gauge group, 2.) real variables, and 3.) canonical Poisson brackets. In conjunction, these properties allow to construct a well defined kinematical quantization of the holonomy flux-algebra on top of which the remaining constraints can be implemented. While this idea has traditionally been mainly used for Einstein gravity, any gravitational theory with the above properties can be accommodated. In this paper, we are going to review three strands of work building on this observation, namely the study of higher-dimensional loop quantum gravity, supersymmetric extensions of loop quantum gravity, as well as the quantization of modified gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with event horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravitational Hair in Gravastars and Observational Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the effective field theory of quantum gravity at second order in curvature, we calculate quantum corrections to the metric of gravastars and the closely related dark energy stars. We find that the quantum corrections in the exterior region depend on the equation of state of the gravastar, thus providing an example of quantum gravitational hair. We continue by calculating the induced quantum corrections to the photon sphere and the bending of light rays in the weak field regime. These corrections, albeit Planck scale suppressed, allow in principle to distinguish these objects from black holes observationally.</description>

      <title>Differential age observations and their constraining power in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the differential age signal valid for cosmic chronometers (passively evolving galaxies) in any space-time that satisfies the following assumptions: (i) The space-time has a metric with Lorentzian signature and the connection is the Levi-Civita connection; (ii) the cosmic chronometers are collectively well approximated as a geodesic and irrotational congruence of time-like worldlines in the space-time; (iii) light travels on null geodesics and caustics on the observer's past light cone can be ignored; (iv) the space-time is cosmological, meaning that isotropic and positive expansion degrees-of-freedom dominate over anisotropic and negative expansion degrees-of-freedom when viewed on sufficiently large scales in the frame of the cosmic chronometers. The main result of the paper is an expression for the differential age signal that is written in terms of line-of-sight averages of the expansion rate along individual null lines, thus providing a kinematic interpretation of the differential age signal applicable to cosmological space-times satisfying (i)--(iv). We explain how this result indicates that the differential age signal is a robust probe of the volume-average expansion rate in very general statistically homogeneous and isotropic space-time scenarios where other probes of the volume-average expansion rate tend to yield biased results. We argue that this unique property of the differential age signal makes it an ideal measurement for constraining the expansion history model-independently.</description>

      <title>The Wigner formalism on black hole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and curved spacetime by employing the Wigner formalism to investigate quantum systems in the vicinity of black holes. Specifically, we study the quantum dynamics of a probe particle bound to a Schwarzschild black hole using a phase-space representation of quantum mechanics. The analysis begins with a review of the covariant Wigner function in curved spacetime, highlighting its application to spherically symmetric, uncharged black holes. We then derive an effective potential from the Schwarzschild metric, which defines the Hamiltonian for the electron. Relativistic corrections are treated perturbatively to estimate energy levels and associated Wigner functions for the bound state. Additionally, we compare the results obtained through the Schrodinger equation with those derived directly using the symplectic formalism, demonstrating the consistency and versatility of the phase-space approach. The study sheds light on quantum behavior near black holes and suggests new avenues for combining quantum kinetic theory with relativistic gravitational settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the implications of a black hole featuring a de Sitter core. We begin by analyzing the spacetime and event horizon in the presence of de Sitter core. Then the partial wave equation necessary for calculating quasinormal modes is derived and the relation of scalar quasinormal modes with the de Sitter core parameter is explored. Subsequently, we explore the greybody factors and their correspondence with the gravitational quasinormal modes. We also analyze the emission rate. Finally, variations in the thin accretion disks and the influence of de Sitter core spacetime on the optical appearance of the black hole are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic matching between past infinity and future infinity: The massless scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching conditions relating the fields at the future of past null infinity with the fields at the past of future null infinity play a central role in the analysis of asymptotic symmetries and conservation laws in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These matching conditions can be derived from initial data given on a Cauchy hypersurface by integrating forward and backward in time the field equations to leading order in an asymptotic expansion, all the way to future and past null infinities. The standard matching conditions considered in the literature are valid only in the case when the expansion near null infinity (which is generically polylogarithmic) has no dominant logarithmic term.
  This paper is the first in a series in which we derive the matching conditions for a massless scalar field with initial conditions leading to dominant logarithms at null infinity. We prove that these involve the opposite sign with respect to the usual matching conditions. We also analyse the matching of the angle-dependent conserved charges that follow from the asymptotic decay and Lorentz invariance. We show in particular that these are well defined and finite at null infinity even in the presence of leading logarithmic terms provided one uses the correct definitions.
  The free massless scalar field has the virtue of presenting the polylogarithmic features in a particularly clear setting that shows their inevitability, since there is no subtle gauge fixing issue or nonlinear intrincacies involved in the problem. We also consider the case of higher spacetime dimensions where fractional powers of $r$ (odd spacetime dimensions) or subdominant logarithmic terms (even spacetime dimensions) are present. Mixed matching conditions are then relevant. In subsequent papers, we will extend the analysis to the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise the technique of semiclassical effective dynamics, in particular reexamining the evaluation of Poisson structure of the so-called central moments capturing quantum corrections, providing a systematic, pedagogical, and efficient algorithm for evaluation of said structure. The resulting closed formulae for Poisson brackets involve less summatios than recent results in the literature, thus being more optimal for applications. Found formulae are then applied to a general class of isotropic cosmological models with locally observable configuration variables for the admitted matter fields. In particular, this allowed to formulate a consistent and nontrivial limit or fiducial cell (infrared regulator) removal for models describing spatially noncompact spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Field Sources for Wormholes With Multiple Throats/Anti-throats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the characteristics of wormholes with multiple throats/anti-throats in the context of general relativity. The presence of these structures is verified through the minima and maxima in the area of these wormholes. Using embedding diagrams, we demonstrate that these compact objects exhibit a structure that stands out significantly compared to usual wormholes. We also performed a study of the geodesics in this type of spacetime. We showed that these objects can be obtained from Einstein's equations when considering the coupling of a nonlinear electrodynamics with a phantom scalar field. We demonstrated that different scalar field profiles can generate the same solution. Furthermore, we analyzed the energy conditions and verified that, depending on the chosen parameters, it is always possible to satisfy them in certain regions of the spacetime.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Higher Dimensional Black Holes as Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center-of-mass energy of two colliding particles could be arbitrarily high in the vicinity of event horizons of the extremal Myers-Perry black holes if the angular momentum of colliding particles is fine-tuned to the critical values. We investigate the maximum efficiency of two colliding particles in four and six dimensions. The efficiency of collision for two particles near the four-dimensional Kerr black holes is 130 %. We show that the efficiency increases to 145 % for collision in six dimensions. We also show that the region for the polar angle in which the particle can reach the high energy is larger when the dimension of space-time increases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <title>Weyl Geometry in Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel oscillatory behaviour of the DC conductivity in Weyl semimetals with vacancies has recently been identified, occurring in the absence of external magnetic fields. Here, we argue that this effect has a geometric interpretation in terms of a magnetic-like field induced by an emergent Weyl connection. This geometric gauge field is related to the non-metricity of the underlying effective geometry, which is physically induced by vacancies in the lattice system. Finally, we postulate that the chiral magnetic effect in Weyl semimetals can be affected by the presence of dynamical vacancies.</description>

      <title>Testing $f(R)$ Gravity from Cosmic Shear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a detailed analysis to constrain the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, using cosmic shear data from three prominent Stage-III weak lensing surveys: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000, and HSC-Y3. To accurately model the nonlinear matter clustering in the analysis of cosmic shear signals, we employ FREmu, a recently developed power spectrum emulator for the $f(R)$ gravity trained on the Quijote-MG simulations. This emulator achieves precise predictions, limiting the errors to 5% on scales of $0.009h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.5h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our findings reveal that cosmic shear data alone impose only weak constraints on the $f(R)$ parameter $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}|$. To improve these constraints, we incorporate state-of-the-art external observations, including data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. The inclusion of these external datasets significantly enhances the constraints, yielding an upper limit of $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}| &lt; -4.79$ at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the framework recently proposed by Oppenheim et al. to model relativistic quantum fields coupled to relativistic, classical, stochastic fields (in particular, as a model of quantum matter coupled to ``classical gravity''). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that we can define and calculate scattering probabilities which are Lorentz-covariant and conserve total probability, at least at tree level. As a concrete example, we analyze $2 \to 2$ scattering of quantum matter mediated by a classical Yukawa field. Mapping this to a gravitational coupling in the non-relativistic limit, and assuming that we can treat large objects as point masses, we find that the simplest possible ``classical-quantum'' gravity theory constructed this way gives predictions for $2 \to 2$ gravitational scattering which are inconsistent with simple observations of, e.g., spacecraft undergoing slingshot maneuvers. We comment on lessons learned for attempts to couple quantum matter to ``non-quantum'' gravity, or more generally, for attempts to couple relativistic quantum and classical systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze the asymptotic symmetries of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) gravity theory for a higher spin extension of the so-called Maxwell algebra. We propose a generalized set of asymptotic boundary conditions for the aforementioned flat gravity theory and we show that the corresponding charge algebra defines a higher-spin extension of the $\mathfrak{max}$-$\mathfrak{bms}_{3}$ algebra, which in turn corresponds the asymptotic symmetries of the Maxwell CS gravity. We also show that the $\mathfrak{hs}_3\mathfrak{max}$-$\mathfrak{bms}_{3}$ algebra can alternatively be obtained as a vanishing cosmological constant limit of three copies of the $\mathcal{W}_3$ algebra, with three independent central charges.</description>

      <title>Radiative Back-Reaction on Charged Particle Motion in the Dipole Magnetosphere of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of charged particles under the Lorentz force in the magnetosphere of neutron stars, represented by a dipole field in the Schwarzschild spacetime, can be determined by an effective potential, whose local extrema govern circular orbits both in and off the equatorial plane, which coincides with the symmetry plane of the dipole field. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the properties of these "conservative" circular orbits and, using the approximation represented by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, examine the role of the radiative back-reaction force that influences the motion of charged particles following both the in and off equatorial circular orbits, as well as the chaotic orbits confined to belts centered around the circular orbits. To provide clear insight into these dynamics, we compare particle motion with and without the back-reaction force. We demonstrate that, in the case of an attractive Lorentz force, the back-reaction leads to the charged particles falling onto the neutron star's surface in all scenarios considered. For the repulsive Lorentz force, in combination with the back-reaction force, we observe a widening of stable equatorial circular orbits; the off-equatorial orbits shift toward the equatorial plane and subsequently widen if they are sufficiently close to the plane. Otherwise, the off-equatorial orbits evolve toward the neutron star surface. The critical latitude, which separates orbital widening from falling onto the surface, is determined numerically as a function of the electromagnetic interaction's intensity.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the Hawking spectrum by exponentiating a series of Feynman diagrams describing a scalar field scattering through a collapse background. Our approach is rooted in semiclassical methods of scattering amplitudes which have recently been developed for application to gravitational-wave physics. The diagrams we encounter do not compute a standard amplitude, but rather an in-in generalisation of an amplitude which is closely connected to the Bogoliubov coefficients. We also compute the subdominant one-loop correction in our perturbative approach, analogous to the triangle correction to Schwarzschild scattering. This term can be interpreted as a finite-size correction sensitive to the radius of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: The gravity's rainbow function is derived in terms of a new varying speed of light (VSL) theory that varying velocity of light in the rainbow gravity becomes smaller when the energy of photons increases. In light of the new theory we calculate the modified temperature, entropy and heat capacity of the Schwarzschild, Kerr, AdS black holes, as well as spinning black rings. Our results demonstrate that in rainbow gravity the behaviors of various black holes have remarkably essential difference from those of standard black holes near the Planck scale, and a logarithmic term emerges in the formula of the entropy of every black object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.07066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a testable alternative to inflation directly built in a very general class of ultraviolet complete theories of quantum gravity enjoying Weyl invariance. After the latter is spontaneously broken, logarithmic quantum corrections to the action make both the primordial tensor spectrum (from graviton fluctuations) and the scalar spectrum (from thermal fluctuations) quasi scale invariant. We predict a scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ which only depends on two parameters and is consistent with observations, a tensor index $n_{\rm t} =1-n_{\rm s}&gt;0$, and, if the fundamental energy scale of the theory $\Lambda_*=M_{\textrm{Pl}}$ is of order of the Planck mass, a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}\approx 0.01$ detectable by BICEP Array and LiteBIRD in the immediate or near future, respectively, and a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background observable by DECIGO in the further future. From the observational constraint $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$, we also find the lower bound $\Lambda_*&gt; 8.5\times 10^{10}\,{\rm GeV}$, much stronger than any previous one for this class of theories.</description>

Abstract: We address the thermodynamic evolution of the universe under quantum gravity by considering the conditions for the existence of an arrow of time that drives it.

      <title>Optimizing post-Newtonian parameters and fixing the BMS frame for numerical-relativity waveform hybridizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black holes provide precise waveforms, but are typically too computationally expensive to produce waveforms with enough orbits to cover the whole frequency band of gravitational-wave observatories. Accordingly, it is important to be able to hybridize NR waveforms with analytic, post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, which are accurate during the early inspiral phase. We show that to build such hybrids, it is crucial to both fix the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the NR waveforms to match that of PN theory, and optimize over the PN parameters. We test such a hybridization procedure including all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes with $|m|\leq \ell$ for $\ell\leq 8$, using 29 NR waveforms with mass ratios $q\leq 10$ and spin magnitudes $|\chi_1|, |\chi_2|\leq 0.8$. We find that for spin-aligned systems, the PN and NR waveforms agree very well. The difference is limited by the small nonzero orbital eccentricity of the NR waveforms, or equivalently by the lack of eccentric terms in the PN waveforms. To maintain full accuracy of the simulations, the matching window for spin-aligned systems should be at least 5 orbits long and end at least 15 orbits before merger. For precessing systems, the errors are larger than for spin-aligned cases. The errors are likely limited by the absence of precession-related spin-spin PN terms. Using $10^5\,M$ long NR waveforms, we find that there is no optimal choice of the matching window within this time span, because the hybridization result for precessing cases is always better if using earlier or longer matching windows. We provide the mean orbital frequency of the smallest acceptable matching window as a function of the target error between the PN and NR waveforms and the black hole spins.</description>

Abstract: We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a scalar field together with a vector field minimally coupled to gravity. By assuming an effective potential that incorporates both fields into the action, we explore two distinct scenarios: one where the fields interact and another where they do not. In this context, we find different analytical solutions to the background scalar-vector fields dynamics during the inflationary scenario considering the slow-roll approximation. Besides, general conditions required for these models of two fields to be realizable are determined and discussed. From the cosmological perturbations, we consider a local field rotation, and then we determine these perturbations (scalar and tensor) during inflation, and we also utilize recent cosmological observations for constraining the parameter-space in these scalar-vector inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Aspects of a novel nonlinear electrodynamics in flat spacetime and in a gravity-coupled scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein's General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Exact Regular Black Hole Solutions with de Sitter Cores and Hagedorn Fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three exact solutions to the Einstein field equations, each illustrating different black hole models. The first solution introduces a black hole with a variable equation of state, $P = k(r)\rho$, which can represent both singular and regular black holes depending on the parameters $M_0$ and $w_0$. The second solution features a black hole with Hagedorn fluid, relevant to the late stages of black hole formation, and reveals similarities to the first solution by also describing both singular and regular black holes in a specific case. Furthermore, we investigate the shadows cast by these black hole solutions to constrain their parameters. Recognizing that real astrophysical black holes are dynamic, we developed a third, dynamical solution that addresses gravitational collapse and suggests the potential formation of naked singularities. This indicates that a black hole can transition from regular to singular and back to regular during its evolution.</description>

      <title>Radial Mode Stability of Two-Fluid Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial mode stability is a necessary condition for the astrophysical viability of compact objects. In recent years, astrophysical models with two fluids have gain popularity, especially in their ability to model dark matter admixed neutron stars. Just as is the case of single-fluid stars, a stability criterion based on the background equations has been developed -- the critical curve for the particle numbers of the two fluids in the two-dimensional configuration space determines a one-dimensional sequence that labels the marginally stable configurations -- but its validity depends on the linear stability of radial perturbations which remains unstudied. In this paper, we establish a set of stability criteria for two perfect-fluid relativistic stars by carefully studying the radial mode perturbation equations. We prove that modes are complete, have real eigenvalues with a minimum eigenvalue (i.e. a fundamental mode), thus a configuration is stable if and only if the fundamental mode is positive. As a consequence, our work formally and rigorously proves these necessary conditions for the stability criterion based on the background equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models - developed to approach spacetime quantization - can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many features of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models. In the last section of the paper I give a first example on how to apply this mathematical framework to more realistic (non maximally symmetric) spacetime models, such as $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ and matter-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. I. Time-radial-symmetric metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering three phenomenological, regular tr (time-radial)-symmetric space-times (including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones), featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For all three metrics we find that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by potentially an order of magnitude or more, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is devoted to non-\textit{tr}-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ghost Pilgrim Dark Energy Fractal Cosmology with Observational Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore dark energy models, mainly ghost, generalized ghost, and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy models within the framework of fractal cosmology. To obtain solutions for the field equations, we employ a parameterization of the deceleration parameter as proposed by \textit{R.K. Tiwari}. By utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solutions. The analysis is based on observational datasets, including 57 data points from the Observational Hubble Data ($OHD$) and, 1048 points from the $Pantheon$ Supernovae sample. This approach allows us to assess the viability of the dark energy models in describing the current cosmic expansion. According to the effective equation-of-state parameter, the model maintains itself in the quintessence era and ultimately switches into the Einstein-de Sitter model. Furthermore, we investigate the statefinder, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. The energy conditions of each model satisfy the weak and null energy conditions but violate the strong energy condition. We find that the $Om(z)$ curves for the data samples exhibit a consistently negative slope throughout the entire range.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate head-on collisions of $\ell$-boson stars, potential candidates for dark matter compact objects. We begin with a review of the general properties and features of these stars, leveraging results from prior studies to analyze the gravitational wave signals generated by such collisions. Considering a maximum distance of 100 Mpc for potential events, we identify the range of masses and scalar field frequencies for these stars that would render the gravitational waves detectable by current gravitational wave observatories. Additionally, we process the resulting signals to generate simulated observatory images, highlighting their similarities and differences compared to those produced by black hole collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the viscous fluid cosmological model that when certain conditions are invoked mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. The background equations governing the evolution of viscous interacting fluids in a multifluid system are derived. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is applied to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters with Supernova Type 1a data. In addition, linear cosmological perturbations are investigated in a dust-matter-dominated frame using a $1+3$ covariant formalism approach. It is evident from the perturbation results obtained that the model predicts the disintegration of bound structures of large-scale structures in the late-time universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (${\it blind}$ reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (${\it template}$ reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools are integrated into the package ${\tt GWBackFinder}$, which is publicly available in https://github.com/AndronikiDimitriou/GWBackFinder.</description>

Abstract: The imaging of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87*) by the Event Horizon Telescope constrains the location and nature of emission from these objects. Coupled with flux limits from the near-infrared through the ultraviolet, the attendant size constraints provide strong evidence for the absence of an accretion-powered photosphere, and therefore for the existence of an event horizon about an astrophysical black hole. Here, we demonstrate that a broad class of naked singularities exhibit inner turning points for time-like geodesics, and therefore may generically be excluded, regardless of the nature and unknown physical impact of singularity itself, subject to the single weak assumption that the its nongravitational impact is localized to its immediate vicinity. While we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we are nevertheless able to exclude or constrain a large number of commonly invoked naked singularity spacetimes in this way.</description>

      <title>Duality Constraints on Thermal Spectra of 3d Conformal Field Theories and 4d Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N conformal field theories (CFTs) correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from inflation in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various scenarios of cosmic inflation enhance the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at frequencies detectable by the LISA detector. We develop tools for a template-based analysis of the SGWB and introduce a template databank to describe well-motivated signals from inflation, prototype their template-based searches, and forecast their reconstruction with LISA. Specifically, we classify seven templates based on their signal frequency shape, and we identify representative fundamental physics models leading to them. By running a template-based analysis, we forecast the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the template parameters of representative benchmark signals, with and without galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We identify the parameter regions that can be probed by LISA within each template. Finally, we investigate how our signal reconstructions shed light on fundamental physics models of inflation: we discuss their impact for measurements of \emph{e.g.,} ~the couplings of inflationary axions to gauge fields; the graviton mass during inflation; the fluctuation seeds of primordial black holes; the consequences of excited states during inflation, and the presence of small-scale spectral features.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for the Black 0-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement entropy between the Black 0-Brane solution to supergravity and its Hawking radiation. The Black 0-Brane admits a dual Gauge theory description in terms of the Matrix model for M-Theory, named BFSS theory, which is the theory of open strings on a collection of N D0-branes. Recent studies of the model have highlighted a mechanism of Black Hole evaporation for this system, based on the chaotic nature of the theory and the existence of flat directions. This paper further explores this idea, through the computation of the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation. In particular, we show that the expected Page curve is indeed reproduced, consistently with a complete recovery of information after the Black Hole has fully evaporated. A pivotal step in the computation is the definition of a Hilbert space which allows for a quantum mechanical description of partially evaporated Black Holes. We find that the entanglement entropy depends on the choice of a parameter, which can be interpreted as summarizing the geometric features of the Black Hole, such as the size of the resolved singularity and the size of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Charged Nariai Black Holes. II. Rotation Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kerr-Newman black holes in a de Sitter (dS) space have the limit of rotating Nariai black holes with the near-horizon geometry of a warped ${\rm dS}_3 \times {\rm S}^1/Z_2$ when the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon coincide or approach close to each other. We study the rotation effect on the spontaneous emission of charges in the near-extremal rotating charged Nariai black hole and compare it to those from the near-extremal Nariai black hole in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{110}, 085020 (2024) and near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in de Sitter space in Eur. Phys. J. C \textbf{83}, 219 (2023). In strong contrast to the near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in dS space, the near-extremal rotating Nariai black hole also has an exponential amplification for the emission of high energy charges, which becomes catastrophic regardless of angular momentum when two horizons coincide. The radius of rotating Nariai black holes monotonically increases as the angular momentum and charge of black holes increase, which gives a weaker electric field on the horizon than Nariai black holes. Thus the angular momentum of black holes that drags particles on the horizon decreases the mean number of charges by a factor not by an order. We observe a catastrophic emission of boson condensation for charges with an effective energy equal to the chemical potential in the spacelike outer region of the cosmological horizon. Remarkably, the Schwinger emission of charges in the standard particle model may prevent the rotating Nariai black holes from evolving into spacetimes with a naked singularity when the angular momentum is close to the allowed maximum, which Nariai black holes cannot avoid.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography: Bayesian reconstruction of the galaxy density informed by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark sirens method combines gravitational waves and catalogs of galaxies to constrain the cosmological expansion history, merger rates and mass distributions of compact objects, and the laws of gravity. However, the incompleteness of galaxy catalogs means faint potential host galaxies are unobserved, and must be modeled to avoid inducing a bias. The majority of dark sirens analyses to date assume that the missing galaxies are distributed uniformly across the sky, which is clearly unphysical. We introduce a new Bayesian approach to the reconstruction of galaxy catalogs, which makes full use of our knowledge of large-scale structure. Our method quantifies the uncertainties on the estimated true galaxy number count in each voxel, and is marginalized over cosmological parameters and bias parameters. Crucially, our method further assesses the (absolute) magnitude distribution of galaxies, which is not known from the galaxy catalog itself. We present the details of our method and validate our approach on a galaxy catalog associated to the Millennium Simulation. The tools developed here generate physically-informed and robust host galaxy reconstructions, enabling more informative dark sirens analyses. Stage IV galaxy surveys will display greater redshift overlap with GW observations, whilst remaining incomplete -- emphasizing the importance of our work.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>
