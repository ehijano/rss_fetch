      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering for mass-critical inhomogeneous NLS when $d\ge3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the mass-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $i\partial_{t}u+\Delta u=\pm |x|^{-b}|u|^{\frac{4-2b}{d}}u$ for large $L^2(\mathbb{R} ^d)$ initial data with $d\ge3,0&lt;b&lt;\min \left\{ 2,\frac{d}{2} \right\}$; in the focusing case, we require that the mass is strictly less than that of the ground state.
  Compared with the classical Schr\"odinger case ($b=0$, Dodson, J. Amer. Math. Soc. (2012), Adv. Math. (2015)), the main differences for the inhomogeneous case ($b&gt;0$) are that the presence of the inhomogeneity $|x|^{-b}$ creates a nontrivial singularity at the origin, and breaks the translation symmetry as well as the Galilean invariance of the equation, which makes the establishment of the profile decomposition and long time Strichartz estimates more difficult. To overcome these difficulties, we perform the concentration compactness/rigidity methods of [Kenig and Merle, Invent. Math. (2006)] in the Lorentz space framework, and reduces the problem to the exclusion of almost periodic solutions. The exclusion of these solutions will utilize fractional estimates and long time Strichartz estimates in Lorentz spaces.
  In our study, we obseve that the decay of the inhomogeneity $|x|^{-b}$ at infinity prevents the concentration of the almost periodic solution at infinity in either physical or frequency space. Therefore, we can use classical Morawetz estimates, rather than interaction Morawetz estimates, to exclude the existence of the quasi-soliton.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for Vlasov equations with nonlinear zero-moment dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear Vlasov-type equations involving powers of the zero-order moment and obtain a local existence and uniqueness result within a framework of analytic functions. The proof employs a Banach fixed point argument, where a contraction mapping is built upon the solutions of a corresponding linearized problem. At a formal level, the considered nonlinear kinetic equations are derived from a generalized Vlasov-Poisson type equation under zero-electron-mass and quasi-neutrality assumptions, and are related to compressible Euler equations through monokinetic distributions.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for a Magnetohydrodynamical Model with Intrinsic Magnetisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic magnetohydrodynamics concerns the study of conducting fluids with intrinsic magnetisation under the influence of a magnetic field. It is a generalisation of the magnetohydrodynamical equations and takes into account the dynamics of the magnetisation of a fluid. First proposed by Lingam (Lingam, `Dissipative effects in magnetohydrodynamical models with intrinsic magnetisation', Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation Vol 28, pp 223-231, 2015), the usual equations of magnetohydrodynamics, namely the Navier-Stokes equation and the induction equation, are coupled with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In this paper, the local existence, uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions to this system are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation in the sub-critical and critical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth and bounded domain $\Omega(\subset\mathbf{R}^N)$, we prove the existence of two non-trivial, non-negative solutions for the semilinear degenerate elliptic equation \begin{align} \left. \begin{array}{l} -\Delta_\lambda u=\mu g(z)|u|^{r-1}u+h(z)|u|^{s-1}u \;\text{in}\; \Omega u\in H^{1,\lambda}_0(\Omega) \end{array}\right\} \end{align} where $\Delta_\lambda=\Delta_x+|x|^{2\lambda}\Delta_y$ is the Grushin Laplacian Operator, $z=(x,y)\in\Omega$, $N=n+m;\, n,\, m\geq 1$, $\lambda&gt;0$, $0\leq r&lt;1&lt;s&lt;2^*_\lambda-1$; the functions $g,h$ are of indefinite sign and $2^*_\lambda=\frac{2Q}{Q-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, where $Q=n+(1+\lambda)m$ is the homogeneous dimension associated to the operator $\Delta_\lambda$. As for the critical case $s=2^*_\lambda-1$, we prove the existence of at least two non-trivial, non-negative solutions provided $g\geq 0$ and $h\equiv 1$.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and polygonal vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings article we survey the results in [5] and their motivation, as presented at the 50th Journ\'ees EDP 2024. With the aim of quantifying turbulent behaviors of vortex filaments, we study the multifractality of a family of generalized Riemann's non-differentiable functions. These functions represent, in a certain limit, the trajectory of regular polygonal vortex filaments that evolve according to the binormal flow, the classical model for vortex filaments dynamics. We explain how we determined their spectrum of singularities through a careful design of Diophantine sets, which we study by using the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem and the Mass Transference Principle.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for quasiminima of double-phase problems on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for H\"older continuity at a boundary point for quasiminima of double-phase functionals of $p,q$-Laplace type, in the setting of metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. We use a variational approach based on De Giorgi-type conditions to give a pointwise estimate near a boundary point. The proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

      <title>Longtime behaviors of an epidemic model with nonlocal diffusions and a free boundary: rate of accelerated spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third part of our series of work devoted to the dynamics of an epidemic model with nonlocal diffusions and free boundary. This part is concerned with the rate of accelerated spreading for three types of kernel functions when spreading happens. By constructing the suitable upper and lower solutions, we get the rate of the accelerated spreading of free boundary, which is closely related to the behavior of kernel functions near infinity. Our results indicate that the heavier the tail of the kernel functions are, the faster the rate of accelerated spreading is. Moreover, more accurate spreading profiles for solution component $(u,v)$ are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenisation of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic compatibility of parametrized optimal design problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal design problems where the design corresponds to a coefficient in the principal part of the state equation. The state equation, in addition, is parameter dependent, and we allow it to change type in the limit of this (modeling) parameter. We develop a framework that guarantees asymptotic compatibility, that is unconditional convergence with respect to modeling and discretization parameters to the solution of the corresponding limiting problems. This framework is then applied to two distinct classes of problems where the modeling parameter represents the degree of nonlocality. Specifically, we show unconditional convergence of optimal design problems when the state equation is either a scalar-valued fractional equation, or a strongly coupled system of nonlocal equations derived from the bond-based model of peridynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study simultaneous determination of the strain hardening exponent, the shear modulus and the yield stress in an inverse problem. First, we analyze the direct and the inverse problems. Then we formulate the inverse problem in the Bayesian framework. After solving the direct problem by an iterative approach, we propose a numerical method based on a Bayesian approach for the numerical solution of the inverse problem. Numerical examples with noisy data illustrate applicability and accuracy of the proposed method to some extent.\</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: [1] M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N. Nadirashvili. On the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on surfaces. Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48. [2] T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, P. Michor, and N. Nadirashvili. Bounds on the multiplicity of eigenvalues for fixed membranes. Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k(M))$ of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In [1], $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In [2], $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in [1,2] are not very detailed, and often rely on figures or special configurations of nodal sets. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof that $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative noise is considered where the nonlinear term is of power type and the noise coefficients are purely imaginary numbers. The main purpose of this paper is to construct classical solutions in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for the problem. The techniques of Kato \cite{K87,K89} work well in overcoming this difficulty even for the stochastic equations.</description>

Abstract: Based on the three-ball inequality and the doubling inequality established in [23], we quantify the strong unique continuation established by Koch and Tataru [21] for elliptic operators with unbounded lower-order coefficients. We also derive a uniform quantitative strong unique continuation for eigenfunctions that we use to prove that two Dirichlet-Laplace-Beltrami operators are gauge equivalent whenever their corresponding metrics coincide in the vicinity of the boundary and their boundary spectral data coincide on a subset of positive measure.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, as well as the asymptotic behavior through a finite fractal dimensional global attractor for a general Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation, are investigated. Our findings are innovative, as we employ semigroups and global attractors theories to achieve these results. Also, an analytical solution of a two-dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation is presented. And finally, two Explicit Finite Difference schemes are used to simulate solutions in the two- and three-dimensional cases. The numerical simulations are conducted with predefined initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-uniqueness of weak solutions for the two-dimensional hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations in the super-critical spaces $L_{t}^{\gamma}L_{x}^{p}$ when $\alpha\in[1,\frac{3}{2})$, and obtain the conclusion that the non-uniqueness of the weak solutions at the endpoint $(\gamma,p)=(\infty, \frac{2}{2\alpha-1})$ is sharp in view of the generalized Lady\v{z}enskaja-Prodi-Serrin condition by using a different spatial-temporal building block from [Cheskidov-Luo, Ann. PDE, 9:13 (2023)] and taking advantage of the intermittency of the temporal concentrated function $g_{(k)}$ in an almost optimal way. Our results recover the above 2D non-uniqueness conclusion and extend to the hyper-dissipative case $\alpha \in(1,\frac{3}{2})$.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic traffic flow model with look-ahead effect for mixed autonomy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) non-equilibrium traffic flow model to take into account the look-ahead capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and the mixed flow dynamics of human driven and autonomous vehicles. The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local averaged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show, using wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens the stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a longer look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to equilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and market penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps stabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less effect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to stabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the mixed autonomy environment.</description>

      <title>A Ne\v{c}as-Lions inequality with symmetric gradients on star-shaped domains based on a first order Babu\v{s}ka-Aziz inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Ne\v{c}as-Lions inequality with symmetric gradients on two and three dimensional domains of diameter $R$ that are star-shaped with respect to a ball of radius $\rho$; the constants in the inequality are explicit with respect to $R$ and $\rho$. Crucial tools in deriving this inequality are a first order Babu\v{s}ka-Aziz inequality based on Bogovski\u{i}'s construction of a right-inverse of the divergence and Fourier transform techniques proposed by Dur\'an. As a byproduct, we derive arbitrary order estimates in arbitrary dimension for that operator.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions for Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <title>Strong instability of standing waves for $L^2$-supercritical Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the strong instability of standing waves associated with ground state solutions in the $L^2$-supercritical case. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in examining geometric shapes of fibering maps along an $L^2$-invariant scaling curve. Furthermore, the classical approach by Berestycki-Cazenave for the strong instability cannot be applied to our problem due to a remainder term caused by the doping profile. To overcome these difficulties, we establish a new energy inequality associated with the $L^2$-invariant scaling and adopt the strong instability result developed by Fukaya-Ohta(2018). When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature, are responsible for the strong instability of standing waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>

      <title>Variational methods for scaled functionals with applications to the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop novel variational methods for solving scaled equations that do not have the mountain pass geometry, classical linking geometry based on linear subspaces, or $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, and therefore cannot be solved using classical variational arguments. Our contributions here include new critical group estimates for scaled functionals, nonlinear saddle point and linking geometries based on scaling, a notion of local linking based on scaling, and scaling-based multiplicity results for symmetric functionals. We develop these methods in an abstract setting involving scaled operators and scaled eigenvalue problems. Applications to subcritical and critical Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equations are given.</description>

      <title>Structure of the free interfaces near triple junction singularities in harmonic maps and optimal partition problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider energy-minimizing harmonic maps into trees and we prove the regularity of the singular part of the free interface near triple junction points. Precisely, by proving a new epiperimetric inequality, we show that around any point of frequency $3/2$, the free interface is composed of three $C^{1,\alpha}$-smooth $(d-1)$-dimensional manifolds (composed of points of frequency $1$) with common $C^{1,\alpha}$-regular boundary (made of points of frequency $3/2$) that meet along this boundary at 120 degree angles. Our results also apply to spectral optimal partition problems for the Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of discrete Schr\"{o}dinger equations on the hexagonal triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the hexagonal triangulation. The $l^1\rightarrow l^\infty$ dispersive decay rate is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{3}{4}}$, which is faster than the decay rate of DS on the 2-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, see [32]. The proof relies on the detailed analysis of singularities of the corresponding phase function and the theory of uniform estimates on oscillatory integrals developed by Karpushkin [15]. Moreover, we prove the Strichartz estimate and give an application to the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) on the hexagonal triangulation.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to the Yamabe Problem: Conformal Transformations and Scalar Curvature on Compact Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02397v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We start by taking the analytical approach to discuss how the minimizer of Yamabe functional provides constant scalar curvature and its relationship with the Sobolev Space $W^{1,2}.$ Then, after demonstrating the importance of the sphere $S^n$, with stereographic projection and dilation, we show that the minimizer of Yamabe functional on standard sphere is obtained from a standard round metric $\bar{g}$ by a conformal diffeomorphism, thus giving us the constraint $\lambda (M) &lt; \lambda(S^n),$ which leads us to the final theorem that the Yamabe problem is solvable when $\lambda(M) &lt; \lambda(S^n).$ For the proof of this theorem, we adopt the approach of Concentration-Compactness.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study the existence of Brakke-type weak mean curvature flow satisfying the contact angle condition for general angle $ \theta \in ( 0 , \pi ) $ via Ilmanen's regularization. The main ingredients of the result are the establishment of a compactness theorem for varifolds with the contact angle and the extension of Ilmanen's regularization to the capillarity.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Gauges and Regularity for Stationary Weak Yang$-$Mills Connections in Supercritical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that stationary Yang$-$Mills fields in dimensions 5 belonging to the variational class of weak connections are smooth away from a closed singular set $S$ of vanishing 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our proof is based on an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem, which generalizes to this class of weak connections the existing previous $\varepsilon$-regularity results by G. Tian for smooth connections, by Y. Meyer and the second author for Sobolev and approximable connections, and by T. Tao and G. Tian for admissible connections (which are weak limits of smooth Yang$-$Mills fields). On the path towards establishing $\varepsilon$-regularity, a pivotal step is the construction of controlled Coulomb gauges for general weak connections under small Morrey norm assumptions.</description>
