      <title>Pro-ZD: A Transferable Graph Neural Network Approach for Proactive Zero-Day Threats Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's enterprise network landscape, the combination of perimeter and distributed firewall rules governs connectivity. To address challenges arising from increased traffic and diverse network architectures, organizations employ automated tools for firewall rule and access policy generation. Yet, effectively managing risks arising from dynamically generated policies, especially concerning critical asset exposure, remains a major challenge. This challenge is amplified by evolving network structures due to trends like remote users, bring-your-own devices, and cloud integration. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network model for identifying weighted shortest paths. The model aids in detecting network misconfigurations and high-risk connectivity paths that threaten critical assets, potentially exploited in zero-day attacks -- cyber-attacks exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities. The proposed Pro-ZD framework adopts a proactive approach, automatically fine-tuning firewall rules and access policies to address high-risk connections and prevent unauthorized access. Experimental results highlight the robustness and transferability of Pro-ZD, achieving over 95% average accuracy in detecting high-risk connections. \</description>

      <title>Concept-Aware Privacy Mechanisms for Defending Embedding Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embeddings enable numerous NLP applications but face severe privacy risks from embedding inversion attacks, which can expose sensitive attributes or reconstruct raw text. Existing differential privacy defenses assume uniform sensitivity across embedding dimensions, leading to excessive noise and degraded utility. We propose SPARSE, a user-centric framework for concept-specific privacy protection in text embeddings. SPARSE combines (1) differentiable mask learning to identify privacy-sensitive dimensions for user-defined concepts, and (2) the Mahalanobis mechanism that applies elliptical noise calibrated by dimension sensitivity. Unlike traditional spherical noise injection, SPARSE selectively perturbs privacy-sensitive dimensions while preserving non-sensitive semantics. Evaluated across six datasets with three embedding models and attack scenarios, SPARSE consistently reduces privacy leakage while achieving superior downstream performance compared to state-of-the-art DP methods.</description>

      <title>ShallowJail: Steering Jailbreaks against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have been successful in numerous fields. Alignment has usually been applied to prevent them from harmful purposes. However, aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that deliberately mislead them into producing harmful outputs. Existing jailbreaks are either black-box, using carefully crafted, unstealthy prompts, or white-box, requiring resource-intensive computation. In light of these challenges, we introduce ShallowJail, a novel attack that exploits shallow alignment in LLMs. ShallowJail can misguide LLMs' responses by manipulating the initial tokens during inference. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of~\shallow, which substantially degrades the safety of state-of-the-art LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Trojans in Artificial Intelligence (TrojAI) Final Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) launched the TrojAI program to confront an emerging vulnerability in modern artificial intelligence: the threat of AI Trojans. These AI trojans are malicious, hidden backdoors intentionally embedded within an AI model that can cause a system to fail in unexpected ways, or allow a malicious actor to hijack the AI model at will. This multi-year initiative helped to map out the complex nature of the threat, pioneered foundational detection methods, and identified unsolved challenges that require ongoing attention by the burgeoning AI security field. This report synthesizes the program's key findings, including methodologies for detection through weight analysis and trigger inversion, as well as approaches for mitigating Trojan risks in deployed models. Comprehensive test and evaluation results highlight detector performance, sensitivity, and the prevalence of "natural" Trojans. The report concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for advancing AI security research.</description>

      <title>Lite-BD: A Lightweight Black-box Backdoor Defense via Reviving Multi-Stage Image Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Due to the nature of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications, black-box defenses are more practical than white-box methods, yet existing purification techniques suffer from key limitations: a lack of justification for specific transformations, dataset dependency, high computational overhead, and a neglect of frequency-domain transformations. This paper conducts a preliminary study on various image transformations, identifying down-upscaling as the most effective backdoor trigger disruption technique. We subsequently propose \texttt{Lite-BD}, a lightweight two-stage blackbox backdoor defense. \texttt{Lite-BD} first employs a super-resolution-based down-upscaling stage to neutralize spatial triggers. A secondary stage utilizes query-based band-by-band frequency filtering to remove triggers hidden in specific bands. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art attacks demonstrate that \texttt{Lite-BD} provides robust and efficient protection.

      <title>BadSNN: Backdoor Attacks on Spiking Neural Networks via Adversarial Spiking Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient counterparts of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with high biological plausibility, as information is transmitted through temporal spiking patterns. The core element of an SNN is the spiking neuron, which converts input data into spikes following the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. This model includes several important hyperparameters, such as the membrane potential threshold and membrane time constant. Both the DNNs and SNNs have proven to be exploitable by backdoor attacks, where an adversary can poison the training dataset with malicious triggers and force the model to behave in an attacker-defined manner. Yet, how an adversary can exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs for backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textit{BadSNN}, a novel backdoor attack on spiking neural networks that exploits hyperparameter variations of spiking neurons to inject backdoor behavior into the model. We further propose a trigger optimization process to achieve better attack performance while making trigger patterns less perceptible. \textit{BadSNN} demonstrates superior attack performance on various datasets and architectures, as well as compared with state-of-the-art data poisoning-based backdoor attacks and robustness against common backdoor mitigation techniques. Codes can be found at https://github.com/SiSL-URI/BadSNN.</description>

      <title>Hydra: Robust Hardware-Assisted Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware detection using Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) offers a promising, low-overhead approach for monitoring program behavior. However, a fundamental architectural constraint, that only a limited number of hardware events can be monitored concurrently, creates a significant bottleneck, leading to detection blind spots. Prior work has primarily focused on optimizing machine learning models for a single, statically chosen event set, or on ensembling models over the same feature set. We argue that robustness requires diversifying not only the models, but also the underlying feature sets (i.e., the monitored hardware events) in order to capture a broader spectrum of program behavior. This observation motivates the following research question: Can detection performance be improved by trading temporal granularity for broader coverage, via the strategic scheduling of different feature sets over time? To answer this question, we propose Hydra, a novel detection mechanism that partitions execution traces into time slices and learns an effective schedule of feature sets and corresponding classifiers for deployment. By cycling through complementary feature sets, Hydra mitigates the limitations of a fixed monitoring perspective. Our experimental evaluation shows that Hydra significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-feature-set baselines, achieving a 19.32% improvement in F1 score and a 60.23% reduction in false positive rate. These results underscore the importance of feature-set diversity and establish strategic multi-feature-set scheduling as an effective principle for robust, hardware-assisted malware detection.</description>

      <title>Beyond Crash: Hijacking Your Autonomous Vehicle for Fun and Profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), especially vision-based AVs, are rapidly being deployed without human operators. As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive "normally." This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle.
  In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate.</description>

      <title>Patch-to-PoC: A Systematic Study of Agentic LLM Systems for Linux Kernel N-Day Reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous large language model (LLM) based systems have recently shown promising results across a range of cybersecurity tasks. However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.
  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.
  Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance. These findings provide actionable guidance for building more reliable autonomous security agents and for assessing real-world N-day risk from both offensive and defensive perspectives.</description>

      <title>ACORN-IDS: Adaptive Continual Novelty Detection for Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must maintain reliable detection performance under rapidly evolving benign traffic patterns and the continual emergence of cyberattacks, including zero-day threats with no labeled data available. However, most machine learning-based IDS approaches either assume static data distributions or rely on labeled attack samples, substantially limiting their applicability in real-world deployments. This setting naturally motivates continual novelty detection, which enables IDS models to incrementally adapt to non-stationary data streams without labeled attack data. In this work, we introduce ACORN-IDS, an adaptive continual novelty detection framework that learns exclusively from normal data while exploiting the inherent structure of an evolving unlabeled data stream. ACORN-IDS integrates a continual feature extractor, trained using reconstruction and metric learning objectives with clustering-based pseudo-labels, alongside a PCA-based reconstruction module for anomaly scoring. This design allows ACORN-IDS to continuously adapt to distributional shifts in both benign and malicious traffic. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ACORN-IDS on five realistic intrusion datasets under two continual learning scenarios: (i) Evolving Attacks and (ii) Evolving Normal and Attack Distributions. ACORN-IDS achieves, on average, a 62% improvement in F1-score and a 58% improvement in zero-day attack detection over the state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning baseline. It also outperforms existing state-of-the-art novelty detection approaches while exhibiting near-zero forgetting and imposing minimal inference overhead. These results demonstrate that ACORN-IDS offers a practical, label-efficient solution for building adaptive and robust IDS in dynamic, real-world environments. We plan to release the code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Towards Governance, Integrity, and Security of AI Voice Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement and adoption of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs), voice agents are now being deployed in high-stakes domains such as banking, customer service, and IT support. However, their vulnerabilities to adversarial misuse still remain unexplored. While prior work has examined aspects of trustworthiness in ALLMs, such as harmful content generation and hallucination, systematic security evaluations of voice agents are still lacking. To address this gap, we propose Aegis, a red-teaming framework for the governance, integrity, and security of voice agents. Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents.</description>

      <title>AgentSys: Secure and Dynamic LLM Agents Through Explicit Hierarchical Memory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect prompt injection threatens LLM agents by embedding malicious instructions in external content, enabling unauthorized actions and data theft. LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.
  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.
  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

      <title>Secure Code Generation via Online Reinforcement Learning with Vulnerability Reward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, yet their tendency to generate insecure code remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality--security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionality-preserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality-grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning-based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%. We release our code, dataset and model checkpoints at https://github.com/AndrewWTY/SecCoderX.</description>

Abstract: Multi-implementation systems are increasingly audited against natural-language specifications. Differential testing scales well when implementations disagree, but it provides little signal when all implementations converge on the same incorrect interpretation of an ambiguous requirement. We present SPECA, a Specification-to-Checklist Auditing framework that turns normative requirements into checklists, maps them to implementation locations, and supports cross-implementation reuse.
  We instantiate SPECA in an in-the-wild security audit contest for the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade, covering 11 production clients. Across 54 submissions, 17 were judged valid by the contest organizers. Cross-implementation checks account for 76.5 percent (13 of 17) of valid findings, suggesting that checklist-derived one-to-many reuse is a practical scaling mechanism in multi-implementation audits. To understand false positives, we manually coded the 37 invalid submissions and find that threat model misalignment explains 56.8 percent (21 of 37): reports that rely on assumptions about trust boundaries or scope that contradict the audit's rules. We detected no High or Medium findings in the V1 deployment; misses concentrated in specification details and implicit assumptions (57.1 percent), timing and concurrency issues (28.6 percent), and external library dependencies (14.3 percent). Our improved agent, evaluated against the ground truth of a competitive audit, achieved a strict recall of 27.3 percent on high-impact vulnerabilities, placing it in the top 4 percent of human auditors and outperforming 49 of 51 contestants on critical issues. These results, though from a single deployment, suggest that early, explicit threat modeling is essential for reducing false positives and focusing agentic auditing effort. The agent-driven process enables expert validation and submission in about 40 minutes on average.</description>

      <title>MemPot: Defending Against Memory Extraction Attack with Optimized Honeypots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents employ external and internal memory systems to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks, yet this exposes them to severe extraction attacks, and effective defenses remain lacking. In this paper, we propose MemPot, the first theoretically verified defense framework against memory extraction attacks by injecting optimized honeypots into the memory. Through a two-stage optimization process, MemPot generates trap documents that maximize the retrieval probability for attackers while remaining inconspicuous to benign users. We model the detection process as Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and theoretically prove that MemPot achieves a lower average number of sampling rounds compared to optimal static detectors. Empirically, MemPot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 50% improvement in detection AUROC and an 80% increase in True Positive Rate under low False Positive Rate constraints. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that MemPot incurs zero additional online inference latency and preserves the agent's utility on standard tasks, verifying its superiority in safety, harmlessness, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust management systems (TMS) are crucial for managing trust in distributed environments. The rise of decentralized systems and blockchain has sparked interest in credential-based decentralized trust management systems (DTMS). This paper bridges the gap between theory and practice through a systematic review of credential-based DTMS. We analyze existing DTMS solutions through multiple dimensions, including their architectural designs, credential mechanisms, and trust evaluation models. Our survey provides a detailed taxonomy of credential-based DTMS approaches and establishes comprehensive evaluation criteria for assessing DTMS implementations. Through extensive analysis of current systems and implementations, we identify critical challenges and promising research directions in the field. Our examination offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working on DTMS, particularly in areas such as access control, reputation systems, and blockchain-based trust frameworks.</description>

      <title>Agent-Fence: Mapping Security Vulnerabilities Across Deep Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as *deep agents* that plan, maintain persistent state, and invoke external tools, shifting safety failures from unsafe text to unsafe *trajectories*. We introduce **AgentFence**, an architecture-centric security evaluation that defines 14 trust-boundary attack classes spanning planning, memory, retrieval, tool use, and delegation, and detects failures via *trace-auditable conversation breaks* (unauthorized or unsafe tool use, wrong-principal actions, state/objective integrity violations, and attack-linked deviations). Holding the base model fixed, we evaluate eight agent archetypes under persistent multi-turn interaction and observe substantial architectural variation in mean security break rate (MSBR), ranging from $0.29 \pm 0.04$ (LangGraph) to $0.51 \pm 0.07$ (AutoGPT). The highest-risk classes are operational: Denial-of-Wallet ($0.62 \pm 0.08$), Authorization Confusion ($0.54 \pm 0.10$), Retrieval Poisoning ($0.47 \pm 0.09$), and Planning Manipulation ($0.44 \pm 0.11$), while prompt-centric classes remain below $0.20$ under standard settings. Breaks are dominated by boundary violations (SIV 31%, WPA 27%, UTI+UTA 24%, ATD 18%), and authorization confusion correlates with objective and tool hijacking ($\rho \approx 0.63$ and $\rho \approx 0.58$). AgentFence reframes agent security around what matters operationally: whether an agent stays within its goal and authority envelope over time.</description>

      <title>AirCatch: Effectively tracing advanced tag-based trackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tag-based tracking ecosystems help users locate lost items, but can be leveraged for unwanted tracking and stalking. Existing protocol-driven defenses and prior academic solutions largely assume stable identifiers or predictable beaconing. However, identifier-based defenses fundamentally break down against advanced rogue trackers that aggressively rotate identifiers. We present AirCatch, a passive detection system that exploits a physical-layer constraint: while logical identifiers can change arbitrarily fast, the transmitter's analog imprint remains stable and reappears as a compact and persistently occupied region in Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) feature space. AirCatch advances the state of the art along three axes: (i) a novel, modulation-aware CFO fingerprint that augments packet-level CFO with content-independent CFO components that amplify device distinctiveness; (ii) a new tracking detection algorithm based on high core density and persistence that is robust to contamination and evasion through per-identifier segmentation; and (iii) an ultra-low-cost receiver, an approximately 10 dollar BLE SDR named BlePhasyr, built from commodity components, that makes RF fingerprinting based detection practical in resource-constrained deployments. We evaluate AirCatch across Apple, Google, Tile, and Samsung tag families in multi-hour captures, systematically stress-test evasion using a scenario generator over a grid of transmission and rotation periods, and validate in diverse real-world mobility traces including home and office commutes, public transport, car travel, and airport journeys while sweeping background tag density. Across these stress tests, AirCatch achieves no false positives and early detection over a wide range of adversarial configurations and environments, degrading gracefully only in extreme low-rate regimes that also reduce attacker utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC, 2023--2025) is the largest competition to date for building fully autonomous cyber reasoning systems (CRSs) that leverage recent advances in AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs) -- to discover and remediate vulnerabilities in real-world open-source software. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of AIxCC. Drawing on design documents, source code, execution traces, and discussions with organizers and competing teams, we examine the competition's structure and key design decisions, characterize the architectural approaches of finalist CRSs, and analyze competition results beyond the final scoreboard. Our analysis reveals the factors that truly drove CRS performance, identifies genuine technical advances achieved by teams, and exposes limitations that remain open for future research. We conclude with lessons for organizing future competitions and broader insights toward deploying autonomous CRSs in practice.</description>

      <title>IPBAC: Interaction Provenance-Based Access Control for Secure and Privacy-Aware Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional access control systems, including RBAC, face significant limitations such as inflexible role definitions, difficulty handling dynamic scenarios, and lack of detailed accountability and traceability. To this end, we introduce the Interaction Provenance-based Access Control (IPBAC) model. In this paper, we explore the integration of interaction provenance with access control to overcome these limitations. Interaction provenance refers to the detailed recording of actions and interactions within a system, capturing comprehensive metadata such as the identity of the actor, the time of an action, and the context. IPBAC ensures stronger protection against unauthorized access, enhances traceability for auditing and compliance, and supports adaptive security policies. This provenance-based access control not only strengthens security, but also provides a robust framework for auditing and compliance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Power of Ensemble Learning for Secure Low Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) holds immense promise for enhancing societal well-being and driving economic growth. However, this burgeoning field is vulnerable to security threats, particularly malicious aircraft intrusion attacks. To address the above concerns, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to defend against malicious aircraft intrusions in LAE. Whereas, due to the heterogeneous data, dynamic environment, and resource-constrained devices within LAE, current IDS face challenges in detection accuracy, adaptability, and resource utilization ratio. In this regard, due to the inherent ability to combine the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning can realize more robust and diverse anomaly detection further enhance IDS accuracy, thereby improving robustness and efficiency of the secure LAE. Unlike single-model approaches, ensemble learning can leverage the collective knowledge of its constituent models to effectively defend the malicious aircraft intrusion attacks. Specifically, this paper investigates ensemble learning for secure LAE, covering research focuses, solutions, and a case study. We first establish the rationale for ensemble learning and then review research areas and potential solutions, demonstrating the necessities and benefits of applying ensemble learning to secure LAE. Subsequently, we propose a framework of ensemble learning-enabled malicious aircrafts tracking in the secure LAE, where its feasibility and effectiveness are evaluated by the designed case study. Finally, we conclude by outlining promising future research directions for further advancing the ensemble learning-enabled secure LAE.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Latency Denial-of-Service: Attacking the LLM Serving Framework, Not the Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models face an emerging and critical threat known as latency attacks. Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. "Fill" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while "Squeeze" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.</description>

      <title>CausalArmor: Efficient Indirect Prompt Injection Guardrails via Causal Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents equipped with tool-calling capabilities are susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Covert Communication Using Encrypted Wearable Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure communication is essential in covert and safety-critical settings where verbal interactions may expose user intent or operational context. Wearable gesture-based communication enables low-effort, nonverbal interaction, but existing systems leak motion data, intermediate representations, or inference outputs to untrusted infrastructure, enabling intent inference, behavioral biometric leakage, and insider attacks. This work proposes a privacy-preserving gesture-based covert communication system that ensures, no raw sensor signals, learned features, or classification outputs are exposed to any third-party. The system employs a multi-party homomorphic learning pipeline for gesture recognition directly over encrypted motion data, preventing adversaries from inferring gesture semantics, replaying sensor traces, or accessing intermediate representations. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply encrypted gesture recognition in a wearable-based covert communication setting. We design and evaluate haptic and visual feedback mechanisms for covert signal delivery and evaluate the system using 600 gesture samples from a commodity smartwatch, achieving over 94.44% classification accuracy and demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system with practical deployability from high-performance systems to resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>ICBAC: an Intelligent Contract-Based Access Control framework for supply chain management by integrating blockchain and federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of access control in modern supply chains, which operate across multiple independent and competing organizations. Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.
  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.
  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing. ICBAC thus offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic, privacy-preserving access control in decentralized supply chains.</description>

      <title>CyberExplorer: Benchmarking LLM Offensive Security Capabilities in a Real-World Attacking Simulation Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world offensive security operations are inherently open-ended: attackers explore unknown attack surfaces, revise hypotheses under uncertainty, and operate without guaranteed success. Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>IssueGuard: Real-Time Secret Leak Prevention Tool for GitHub Issue Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GitHub and GitLab are widely used collaborative platforms whose issue-tracking systems contain large volumes of unstructured text, including logs, code snippets, and configuration examples. This creates a significant risk of accidental secret exposure, such as API keys and credentials, yet these platforms provide no mechanism to warn users before submission. We present \textsc{IssueGuard}, a tool for real-time detection and prevention of secret leaks in issue reports. Implemented as a Chrome extension, \textsc{IssueGuard} analyzes text as users type and combines regex-based candidate extraction with a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for contextual classification. This approach effectively separates real secrets from false positives and achieves an F1-score of 92.70\% on a benchmark dataset, outperforming traditional regex-based scanners. \textsc{IssueGuard} integrates directly into the web interface and continuously analyzes the issue editor, presenting clear visual warnings to help users avoid submitting sensitive data. The source code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/nafiurahman00/IssueGuard}{https://github.com/nafiurahman00/IssueGuard}, and a demonstration video is available at \href{https://youtu.be/kvbWA8rr9cU}{https://youtu.be/kvbWA8rr9cU}.</description>

      <title>A Transfer Learning Approach to Unveil the Role of Windows Common Configuration Enumerations in IEC 62443 Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) depend on highly heterogeneous environments where Linux, proprietary real-time operating systems, and Windows coexist. Although the IEC 62443-3-3 standard provides a comprehensive framework for securing such systems, translating its requirements into concrete configuration checks remains challenging, especially for Windows platforms. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning methodology that maps Windows Common Configuration Enumerations (CCEs) to IEC 62443-3-3 System Security Requirements by leveraging labeled Linux datasets. The resulting labeled dataset enables automated compliance checks, analysis of requirement prevalence, and identification of cross-platform similarities and divergences. Our results highlight the role of CCEs as a bridge between abstract standards and concrete configurations, advancing automation, traceability, and clarity in IEC 62443-3-3 compliance for Windows environments.</description>

      <title>Evasion of IoT Malware Detection via Dummy Code Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized connectivity by linking billions of devices worldwide. However, this rapid expansion has also introduced severe security vulnerabilities, making IoT devices attractive targets for malware such as the Mirai botnet. Power side-channel analysis has recently emerged as a promising technique for detecting malware activity based on device power consumption patterns. However, the resilience of such detection systems under adversarial manipulation remains underexplored.
  This work presents a novel adversarial strategy against power side-channel-based malware detection. By injecting structured dummy code into the scanning phase of the Mirai botnet, we dynamically perturb power signatures to evade AI/ML-based anomaly detection without disrupting core functionality. Our approach systematically analyzes the trade-offs between stealthiness, execution overhead, and evasion effectiveness across multiple state-of-the-art models for side-channel analysis, using a custom dataset collected from smartphones of diverse manufacturers. Experimental results show that our adversarial modifications achieve an average attack success rate of 75.2\%, revealing practical vulnerabilities in power-based intrusion detection frameworks.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-World Industrial-Scale Verification: LLM-Driven Theorem Proving on seL4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal methods (FM) are reliable but costly to apply, often requiring years of expert effort in industrial-scale projects such as seL4, especially for theorem proving. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated theorem proving increasingly feasible. However, most prior work focuses on mathematics-oriented benchmarks such as miniF2F, with limited evaluation on real-world verification projects. The few studies that consider industrial-scale verification mostly rely on closed-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, which cannot be locally deployed and incur substantial usage costs. In this paper, we propose AutoReal, an LLM-driven theorem proving method for real-world industrial-scale systems with support for lightweight local deployment. We evaluate AutoReal on the seL4-Isabelle verification project as a representative and challenging case study. AutoReal incorporates two key improvements: (1) chain-of-thought (CoT)-based proof training, which teaches the LLM the reasoning behind proof steps and enables step-wise explanations alongside proofs, and (2) context augmentation, which leverages proof context from the project to enhance LLM-driven proving. Based on the AutoReal methodology, we fine-tune a base model to obtain AutoReal-Prover, a compact 7B-scale prover for industrial-scale theorem proving. AutoReal-Prover achieves a 51.67% proof success rate on 660 theorems from seL4-designated Important Theories across all 10 seL4 proof categories, substantially outperforming prior attempts on seL4 (27.06%). To evaluate generalization, we further apply AutoReal-Prover to three security-related projects from the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP), covering all 451 theorems and achieving a proof success rate of 53.88%. Overall, this work advances the application of LLM-driven theorem proving in real-world industrial-scale verification.</description>

      <title>LLMs + Security = Trouble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that when it comes to producing secure code with AI, the prevailing "fighting fire with fire" approach -- using probabilistic AI-based checkers or attackers to secure probabilistically generated code -- fails to address the long tail of security bugs. As a result, systems may remain exposed to zero-day vulnerabilities that can be discovered by better-resourced or more persistent adversaries.
  While neurosymbolic approaches that combine LLMs with formal methods are attractive in principle, we argue that they are difficult to reconcile with the "vibe coding" workflow common in LLM-assisted development: unless the end-to-end verification pipeline is fully automated, developers are repeatedly asked to validate specifications, resolve ambiguities, and adjudicate failures, making the human-in-the-loop a likely point of weakness, compromising secure-by-construction guarantees.
  In this paper we argue that stronger security guarantees can be obtained by enforcing security constraints during code generation (e.g., via constrained decoding), rather than relying solely on post-hoc detection and repair. This direction is particularly promising for diffusion-style code models, whose approach provides a natural elegant opportunity for modular, hierarchical security enforcement, allowing us to combine lower-latency generation techniques with generating secure-by-construction code.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Pivot Attacks in Hybrid RAG: Measuring and Mitigating Amplified Leakage from Vector Seeds to Graph Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines combine vector similarity search with knowledge graph expansion for multi-hop reasoning. We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved "seed" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.
  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.
  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point.</description>

      <title>Large Language Lobotomy: Jailbreaking Mixture-of-Experts via Expert Silencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures marks a major shift in the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L$^3$), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L$^3$ learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L$^3$ on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evaluation of SMOTE in Android Malware Detection with Machine Learning: Challenges and Performance in CICMalDroid 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware, malicious software designed to damage computer systems and perpetrate scams, is proliferating at an alarming rate, with thousands of new threats emerging daily. Android devices, prevalent in smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, and IoTs, represent a vast attack surface, making malware detection crucial. Although advanced analysis techniques exist, Machine Learning (ML) emerges as a promising tool to automate and accelerate the discovery of these threats. This work tests ML algorithms in detecting malicious code from dynamic execution characteristics. For this purpose, the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, composed of dynamically obtained Android malware behavior samples, was used with the algorithms XGBoost, Na{\i}ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest (RF). The study focused on empirically evaluating the impact of the SMOTE technique, used to mitigate class imbalance in the data, on the performance of these models. The results indicate that, in 75% of the tested configurations, the application of SMOTE led to performance degradation or only marginal improvements, with an average loss of 6.14 percentage points. Tree-based algorithms, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperformed the others, achieving weighted recall above 94%. It is inferred that SMOTE, although widely used, did not prove beneficial for Android malware detection in the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, possibly due to the complexity and sparsity of dynamic characteristics or the nature of malicious relationships. This work highlights the robustness of tree-ensemble models, such as XGBoost, and suggests that algorithmic data balancing approaches may be more effective than generating synthetic instances in certain cybersecurity scenarios</description>

      <title>DyMA-Fuzz: Dynamic Direct Memory Access Abstraction for Re-hosted Monolithic Firmware Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of smart devices in critical domains--including automotive, medical, industrial--demands robust firmware testing. Fuzzing firmware in re-hosted environments is a promising method for automated testing at scale, but remains difficult due to the tight coupling of code with a microcontroller's peripherals. Existing fuzzing frameworks primarily address input challenges in providing inputs for Memory-Mapped I/O or interrupts, but largely overlook Direct Memory Access (DMA), a key high-throughput interface used that bypasses the CPU. We introduce DyMA-Fuzz to extend recent advances in stream-based fuzz input injection to DMA-driven interfaces in re-hosted environments. It tackles key challenges--vendor-specific descriptors, heterogeneous DMA designs, and varying descriptor locations--using runtime analysis techniques to infer DMA memory access patterns and automatically inject fuzzing data into target buffers, without manual configuration or datasheets. Evaluated on 94 firmware samples and 8 DMA-guarded CVE benchmarks, DyMA-Fuzz reveals vulnerabilities and execution paths missed by state-of-the-art tools and achieves up to 122% higher code coverage. These results highlight DyMA-Fuzz as a practical and effective advancement in automated firmware testing and a scalable solution for fuzzing complex embedded systems.</description>

      <title>CryptoGen: Secure Transformer Generation with Encrypted KV-Cache Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of cloud-hosted generative models raises a fundamental challenge: enabling efficient autoregressive generation while preserving the privacy of both user prompts and model parameters in untrusted environments. We address this challenge in a client-server setting where an untrusted server hosts an autoregressive Transformer and the client requires cryptographic protection for both inputs and inference. We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences. CryptoGen is released as an open-source library.</description>

      <title>ZK-Rollup for Hyperledger Fabric: Architecture and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A big challenge posed in blockchain centric platforms is achieving scalability while also preserving user privacy. This report details the design, implementation and evaluation of a Layer-2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric using Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups). The proposed architecture introduces an off chain sequencer that accepts transactions immediately and sends them for batching into a Merkle tree based rollup, using ZK proofs to attest to the correctness and verifiability of the entire batch.
  The design aims to decouple transaction ingestion from actual on chain settlements to address Fabric scalability limitations and increase throughput under high load conditions. The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds. This work demonstrates that integrating ZK Rollups in Hyperledger Fabric enhances scalability while not compromising the security guarantees of a permissioned blockchain network.</description>

      <title>Reverse Online Guessing Attacks on PAKE Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though not yet widely deployed, password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols have been the subject of several recent standardization efforts, partly because of their resistance against various guessing attacks, but also because they do not require a public-key infrastructure (PKI), making them naturally resistant against PKI failures. The goal of this paper is to reevaluate the PAKE model by noting that the absence of a PKI -- or, more generally, of a mechanism aside from the password for authenticating the server -- makes such protocols vulnerable to reverse online guessing attacks, in which an adversary attempts to validate password guesses by impersonating a server. While their logic is similar to traditional guessing, where the attacker impersonates a client, reverse guessing poses a unique risk because the burden of detection is shifted to the clients, rendering existing defenses against traditional guessing moot. Our results demonstrate that reverse guessing is particularly effective when an adversary attacks clients indiscriminately, such as in phishing or password-spraying attacks, or for applications with automated login processes or a universal password, such as WPA3-SAE. Our analysis suggests that stakeholders should, by default, authenticate the server using more stringent measures than just the user's password, and that a password-only mode of operation should be a last resort against catastrophic security failures when other authentication mechanisms are not available.</description>

      <title>CIC-Trap4Phish: A Unified Multi-Format Dataset for Phishing and Quishing Attachment Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing attacks represents one of the primary attack methods which is used by cyber attackers. In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.</description>

      <title>AI for Sustainable Data Protection and Fair Algorithmic Management in Environmental Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration of AI into environmental regulation represents a significant advancement in data management. It offers promising results in both data protection plus algorithmic fairness. This research addresses the critical need for sustainable data protection in the era of ever evolving cyber threats. Traditional encryption methods face limitations in handling the dynamic nature of environmental data. This necessitates the exploration of advanced cryptographic techniques. The objective of this study is to evaluate how AI can enhance these techniques to ensure robust data protection while facilitating fair algorithmic management. The methodology involves a comprehensive review of current advancements in AI-enhanced homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC). It is coupled with an analysis of how these techniques can be applied to environmental data regulation. Key findings indicate that AI-driven dynamic key management, adaptive encryption schemes, and optimized computational efficiency in HE, alongside AI-enhanced protocol optimization and fault mitigation in MPC, significantly improve the security of environmental data processing. These findings highlight a crucial research gap in the intersection of AI, cyber laws, and environmental regulation, particularly in terms of addressing algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability. The implications of this research underscore the need for stricter cyber laws. Also, the development of comprehensive regulations to safeguard sensitive environmental data. Future efforts should focus on refining AI systems to balance security with privacy and ensuring that regulatory frameworks can adapt to technological advancements. This study provides a foundation for future research aimed at achieving secure sustainable environmental data management through AI innovations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give new differentially private algorithms for the classic problems of learning decision lists and large-margin halfspaces in the PAC and online models. In the PAC model, we give a computationally efficient algorithm for learning decision lists with minimal sample overhead over the best non-private algorithms. In the online model, we give a private analog of the influential Winnow algorithm for learning halfspaces with mistake bound polylogarithmic in the dimension and inverse polynomial in the margin. As an application, we describe how to privately learn decision lists in the online model, qualitatively matching state-of-the art non-private guarantees.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Adaptable Detection of Malicious LLM Prompts via Bootstrap Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.</description>

      <title>RECUR: Resource Exhaustion Attack via Recursive-Entropy Guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) employ reasoning to address complex tasks. Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning.</description>

      <title>InfiCoEvalChain: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Framework for Collaborative LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands increasingly reliable evaluation, yet current centralized evaluation suffers from opacity, overfitting, and hardware-induced variance. Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a "centralized black box" into a "decentralized endorsement" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.</description>

      <title>When Benign Inputs Lead to Severe Harms: Eliciting Unsafe Unintended Behaviors of Computer-Use Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although computer-use agents (CUAs) hold significant potential to automate increasingly complex OS workflows, they can demonstrate unsafe unintended behaviors that deviate from expected outcomes even under benign input contexts. However, exploration of this risk remains largely anecdotal, lacking concrete characterization and automated methods to proactively surface long-tail unintended behaviors under realistic CUA scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs. This work establishes a foundation for systematically analyzing unintended behaviors in realistic computer-use settings.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Adaptive Private Synthesis for Sharing Real-World Data in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of digital technologies has greatly increased the volume of real-world data (RWD) in education. While these data offer significant opportunities for advancing learning analytics (LA), secondary use for research is constrained by privacy concerns. Differentially private synthetic data generation is regarded as the gold-standard approach to sharing sensitive data, yet studies on the private synthesis of educational data remain very scarce and rely predominantly on large, low-dimensional open datasets. Educational RWD, however, are typically high-dimensional and small in sample size, leaving the potential of private synthesis underexplored. Moreover, because educational practice is inherently iterative, data sharing is continual rather than one-off, making a traditional one-shot synthesis approach suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose the Cyclic Adaptive Private Synthesis (CAPS) framework and evaluate it on authentic RWD. By iteratively sharing RWD, CAPS not only fosters open science, but also offers rich opportunities of design-based research (DBR), thereby amplifying the impact of LA. Our case study using actual RWD demonstrates that CAPS outperforms a one-shot baseline while highlighting challenges that warrant further investigation. Overall, this work offers a crucial first step towards privacy-preserving sharing of educational RWD and expands the possibilities for open science and DBR in LA.</description>

      <title>On Protecting Agentic Systems' Intellectual Property via Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic systems that perform autonomous reasoning and tool use has created significant intellectual property (IP) value. We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility.</description>

      <title>RIFLE: Robust Distillation-based FL for Deep Model Deployment on Resource-Constrained IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm widely adopted in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.</description>

      <title>When Evaluation Becomes a Side Channel: Regime Leakage and Structural Mitigations for Alignment Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety evaluation for advanced AI systems implicitly assumes that behavior observed under evaluation is predictive of behavior in deployment. This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.</description>

      <title>Stateless Yet Not Forgetful: Implicit Memory as a Hidden Channel in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly treated as stateless: once an interaction ends, no information is assumed to persist unless it is explicitly stored and re-supplied. We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments. To promote future research, we release code and data at: https://github.com/microsoft/implicitMemory.</description>

      <title>Sparse Models, Sparse Safety: Unsafe Routes in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</description>

      <title>Dashed Line Defense: Plug-And-Play Defense Against Adaptive Score-Based Query Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based query attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning models by crafting adversarial examples (AEs) using only black-box access to model output scores, iteratively optimizing inputs based on observed loss values. While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Pitfalls of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in domains requiring sequential decision-making, motivating its application to cybersecurity problems. However, transitioning DRL from laboratory simulations to bespoke cyber environments can introduce numerous issues. This is further exacerbated by the often adversarial, non-stationary, and partially-observable nature of most cybersecurity tasks. In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training data reconstruction from KKT conditions has shown striking empirical success, yet it remains unclear when the resulting KKT equations have unique solutions and, even in identifiable regimes, how to reliably recover solutions by optimization. This work hereby focuses on these two complementary questions: identifiability and optimization. On the identifiability side, we discuss the sufficient conditions for KKT system of two-layer networks with polynomial activations to uniquely determine the training data, providing a theoretical explanation of when and why reconstruction is possible. On the optimization side, we introduce sample splitting, a curvature-aware refinement step applicable to general reconstruction objectives (not limited to KKT-based formulations): it creates additional descent directions to escape poor stationary points and refine solutions. Experiments demonstrate that augmenting several existing reconstruction methods with sample splitting consistently improves reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>HoGS: Homophily-Oriented Graph Synthesis for Local Differentially Private GNN Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks by effectively modeling high-order interactions between nodes. However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.</description>

      <title>Is Reasoning Capability Enough for Safety in Long-Context Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly combine long-context processing with advanced reasoning, enabling them to retrieve and synthesize information distributed across tens of thousands of tokens. A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.</description>

      <title>StealthRL: Reinforcement Learning Paraphrase Attacks for Multi-Detector Evasion of AI-Text Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol. Code and evaluation pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/StealthRL.</description>

      <title>Zero Trust for Multi-RAT IoT: Trust Boundary Management in Heterogeneous Wireless Network Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Multi-Radio Access Technology, Internet of Things devices, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operating across LoRaWAN, 5G/4G cellular, Meshtastic mesh, proprietary protocols such as DJI OcuSync, MAVLink telemetry links, Wi-Fi, and satellite, creates a fundamental and hitherto unexamined challenge for Zero Trust Architecture adoption. Each transition between radio access technologies constitutes a trust boundary crossing: the device exits one network trust domain and enters another, potentially invalidating authentication state, device attestation, and contextual trust signals. Current ZTA frameworks assume relatively stable network environments and do not address the trust implications of frequent, dynamic RAT switching in mobile IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts in the Real World: A Statistical Exploration of External Data Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts with external data are crucial for functionality but pose security and reliability concerns. Statistical and quantitative studies on this interaction are scarce. To address this gap, we analyzed 10,500 smart contracts, retaining 9,356 valid ones after excluding outdated or erroneous ones. We employed code parsing to transform contract code into abstract syntax trees and identified keywords associated with external data dependencies. We conducted a quantitative analysis by comparing these keywords to a reference list. We manually classified the 9,356 valid smart contracts to ascertain their application domains and typical interaction methods with external data. Additionally, we created a database with this data to facilitate research on smart contract dependencies. Moreover, we reviewed over 3,600 security audit reports, manually identifying 249 (approximately 9%) related to external data interactions and categorized their dependencies. We explored the correlation between smart contract complexity and external data dependency to provide insights for their design and auditing processes. These studies aim to enhance the security and reliability of smart contracts and offer practical guidance to developers and auditors.</description>

      <title>End to End Collaborative Synthetic Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of AI is based on the availability of data to train models. While in some cases a single data custodian may have sufficient data to enable AI, often multiple custodians need to collaborate to reach a cumulative size required for meaningful AI research. The latter is, for example, often the case for rare diseases, with each clinical site having data for only a small number of patients. Recent algorithms for federated synthetic data generation are an important step towards collaborative, privacy-preserving data sharing. Existing techniques, however, focus exclusively on synthesizer training, assuming that the training data is already preprocessed and that the desired synthetic data can be delivered in one shot, without any hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end collaborative framework for publishing of synthetic data that accounts for privacy-preserving preprocessing as well as evaluation. We instantiate this framework with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols and evaluate it in a use case for privacy-preserving publishing of synthetic genomic data for leukemia.</description>

      <title>Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying LLM-generated code through watermarking poses a challenge in preserving functional correctness. Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For rigorous evaluation, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive metric that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal computational overhead. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy preservation in Internet of Things (IoT) systems requires the use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) built from innovative technologies such as cryptography and artificial intelligence (AI) to create techniques called privacy preservation techniques (PPTs). These PPTs achieve various privacy goals and address different privacy concerns by mitigating potential privacy threats within IoT systems. This study carried out a scoping review of different types of PPTs used in previous research works on IoT systems between 2010 and early 2023 to further explore the advantages of privacy preservation in these systems. This scoping review looks at privacy goals, possible technologies used for building PET, the integration of PPTs into the computing layer of the IoT architecture, different IoT applications in which PPTs are deployed, and the different privacy types addressed by these techniques within IoT systems. Key findings, such as the prominent privacy goal and privacy type in IoT, are discussed in this survey, along with identified research gaps that could inform future endeavors in privacy research and benefit the privacy research community and other stakeholders in IoT systems.</description>

      <title>From Data Behavior to Code Analysis: A Multimodal Study on Security and Privacy Challenges in Blockchain-Based DApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) has catalyzed transformative advancements in distributed systems, with extensive deployments observed across financial, entertainment, media, and cybersecurity domains. These trustless architectures, characterized by their decentralized nature and elimination of third-party intermediaries, have garnered substantial institutional attention. Consequently, the escalating security challenges confronting DApp demand rigorous scholarly investigation. This study initiates with a systematic analysis of behavioral patterns derived from empirical DApp datasets, establishing foundational insights for subsequent methodological developments. The principal security vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts developed via Solidity are then critically examined. Specifically, reentrancy vulnerability attacks are addressed by formally representing contract logic using highly expressive code fragments. This enables precise source code-level detection via bidirectional long short-term memory networks with attention mechanisms (BLSTM-ATT). Regarding privacy preservation challenges, contemporary solutions are evaluated through dual analytical lenses: identity privacy preservation and transaction anonymity enhancement, while proposing future research trajectories in cryptographic obfuscation techniques.</description>

      <title>Traceable Black-box Watermarks for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local client has access to the global model, which poses a critical risk of model leakage. Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all watermarked models while preserving their main task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/TraMark.</description>

      <title>Optimal Client Sampling in Federated Learning with Client-Level Heterogeneous Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across all clients, leading to excessive DP noise and significant degradation in model utility. Existing methods to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal performance and lacking strong theoretical foundations. In this work, we address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed, we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penetration testing refers to the process of simulating hacker attacks to evaluate the security of information systems . This study aims not only to clarify the theoretical foundations of penetration testing but also to explain and demonstrate the complete testing process, including how network system administrators may simulate attacks using various penetration testing methods. Methodologically, the paper outlines the five basic stages of a typical penetration test: intelligence gathering, vulnerability scanning, vulnerability exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation activities. In each phase, specific tools and techniques are examined in detail, along with practical guidance on their use. To enhance the practical relevance of the study, the paper also presents a real-life case study, illustrating how a complete penetration test is conducted in a real-world environment. Through this case, readers can gain insights into the detailed procedures and applied techniques, thereby deepening their understanding of the practical value of penetration testing. Finally, the paper summarizes the importance and necessity of penetration testing in securing information systems and maintaining network integrity, and it explores future trends and development directions for the field. Overall, the findings of this paper offer valuable references for both researchers and practitioners, contributing meaningfully to the improvement of penetration testing practices and the advancement of cybersecurity as a whole.</description>

      <title>Practical Feasibility of Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks are often presented as a serious privacy threat in federated learning, with recent work reporting increasingly strong reconstructions under favorable experimental settings. However, it remains unclear whether such attacks are feasible in modern, performance-optimized systems deployed in practice. In this work, we evaluate the practical feasibility of gradient inversion for image-based federated learning. We conduct a systematic study across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification and object detection, using canonical vision architectures at contemporary resolutions. Our results show that while gradient inversion remains possible for certain legacy or transitional designs under highly restrictive assumptions, modern, performance-optimized models consistently resist meaningful reconstruction visually. We further demonstrate that many reported successes rely on upper-bound settings, such as inference mode operation or architectural simplifications which do not reflect realistic training pipelines. Taken together, our findings indicate that, under an honest-but-curious server assumption, high-fidelity image reconstruction via gradient inversion does not constitute a critical privacy risk in production-optimized federated learning systems, and that practical risk assessments must carefully distinguish diagnostic attack settings from real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>EByFTVeS: Efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant-based Verifiable Secret-sharing in Distributed Privacy-preserving Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) has been widespread in Distributed Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (DPML), because invalid shares from malicious dealers or participants can be recognized by verifying the commitment of the received shares for honest participants. However, the consistency and the computation and communitation burden of the VSS-based DPML schemes are still two serious challenges. Although Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) system has been brought to guarantee the consistency and improve the efficiency of the existing VSS-based DPML schemes recently, we explore an Adaptive Share Delay Provision (ASDP) strategy, and launch an ASDP-based Customized Model Poisoning Attack (ACuMPA) for certain participants in this paper. We theoretically analyzed why the ASDP strategy and the ACuMPA algorithm works to the existing schemes. Next, we propose an [E]fficient [By]zantine [F]ault [T]olerant-based [Ve]rifiable [S]ecret-sharing (EByFTVeS) scheme. Finally, the validity, liveness, consistency and privacy of the EByFTVeS scheme are theoretically analyzed, while the efficiency of the EByFTVeS scheme outperforms that of the-state-of-art VSS scheme according to comparative experiment results.</description>

      <title>PAPER: Privacy-Preserving Convolutional Neural Networks using Low-Degree Polynomial Approximations and Structural Optimizations on Leveled FHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has made non-interactive privacy-preserving inference of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) possible. However, the performance of these methods remain limited by their heavy reliance on bootstrapping, a costly FHE operation applied across multiple layers, severely slowing inference. Moreover, they depend on high-degree polynomial approximations of non-linear activations, which increase multiplicative depth and reduce accuracy by 2-5% compared to plaintext ReLU models. In this work, we close the accuracy gap between FHE-based non-interactive CNNs and their plaintext counterparts, while also achieving faster inference than existing methods. We propose a quadratic polynomial approximation of ReLU, which achieves the theoretical minimum multiplicative depth for non-linear activations, together with a penalty-based training strategy. We further introduce structural optimizations that reduce the required FHE levels in CNNs by a factor of five compared to prior work, allowing us to run deep CNN models under leveled FHE without bootstrapping. To further accelerate inference and recover accuracy typically lost with polynomial approximations, we introduce parameter clustering along with a joint strategy of data layout and ensemble techniques. Experiments with VGG and ResNet models on CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet datasets show that our approach achieves up to $4\times$ faster private inference than prior work, with accuracy comparable to plaintext ReLU models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Vulnerabilities of LLM-Assisted Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to help security analysts manage the surge of cyber threats, automating tasks from vulnerability assessment to incident response. Yet in operational CTI workflows, reliability gaps remain substantial. Existing explanations often point to generic model issues (e.g., hallucination), but we argue the dominant bottleneck is the threat landscape itself: CTI is heterogeneous, volatile, and fragmented. Under these conditions, evidence is intertwined, crowdsourced, and temporally unstable, which are properties that standard LLM-based studies rarely capture.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of LLM vulnerabilities in CTI reasoning. We introduce a human-in-the-loop categorization framework that robustly labels failure modes across the CTI lifecycle, avoiding the brittleness of automated "LLM-as-a-judge" pipelines. We identify three domain-specific cognitive failures: spurious correlations from superficial metadata, contradictory knowledge from conflicting sources, and constrained generalization to emerging threats. We validate these mechanisms via causal interventions and show that targeted defenses reduce failure rates significantly. Together, these results offer a concrete roadmap for building resilient, domain-aware CTI agents.</description>

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>CITADEL: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Malware Detection Under Continuous Distribution Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Android malware detection systems suffer severe performance degradation over time due to concept drift caused by evolving malicious and benign app behaviors. Although recent methods leverage active learning and hierarchical contrastive loss to address drift, they remain fully supervised, computationally expensive, and ineffective on long-term real-world benchmark. Moreover, expert labeling does not scale to the monthly emergence of nearly 300K new Android malware samples, leaving most data unlabeled and underutilized.
  To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a semi-supervised active learning framework for Android malware detection. Existing semi-supervised methods assume continuous and semantically meaningful input transformations, and fail to generalize well to high-dimensional binary malware features. We bridge this gap with malware-specific augmentations, Bernoulli bit flips and feature masking, that stochastically perturb feature to regularize learning under evolving malware distributions. \system further incorporates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under constrained labeling budgets. Extensive evaluation on four large-scale Android malware benchmarks -- APIGraph, Chen-AZ, MaMaDroid, and LAMDA, demonstrates that \system outperforms prior work, achieving F1 score of over 1\%, 3\%, 7\%, and 14\% respectively, using only 40\% labeled samples. Furthermore, \system shows significant efficiency over prior work incurring $24\times$ faster training and $13\times$ fewer operations.

      <title>Constant-Size Cryptographic Evidence Structures for Regulated AI Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulated AI workflows (such as clinical trials, medical decision support, and financial compliance) must satisfy strict auditability and integrity requirements. Existing audit-trail mechanisms rely on variable-length records, bulky cryptographic transcripts, or ad-hoc schemas, suffering from metadata leakage, irregular performance, and weak alignment with formal security notions.This paper introduces constant-size cryptographic evidence structures, a general abstraction for verifiable audit evidence in regulated AI workflows. Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields designed to (i) bind strongly to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, and (iii) compose cleanly with hash-chain and Merkle-based audit constructions. We formalize a model of regulated AI workflows, define syntax and algorithms for evidence structures, and prove security properties (evidence binding, tamper detection, and non-equivocation) via game-based definitions under standard assumptions (collision-resistant hashing and EUF-CMA signatures).We present a generic hash-and-sign construction using a collision-resistant hash function and a standard signature scheme, and show how to integrate it with hash-chained logs, Merkle-tree anchoring, and trusted execution environments. We implement a prototype library and report microbenchmarks on commodity hardware, demonstrating that per-event overhead is small and predictable. This work aims to provide a foundation for standardized audit mechanisms in regulated AI, with implications for clinical trial management, pharmaceutical compliance, and medical AI governance.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum-Resilient Audit Evidence for Long-Lived Regulated Systems: Security Models, Migration Patterns, and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant-size cryptographic evidence records are increasingly used to build audit trails for regulated AI workloads in clinical, pharmaceutical, and financial settings, where each execution is summarized by a compact, verifiable record of code identity, model version, data digests, and platform measurements. Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.</description>

      <title>SoK: Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous agents capable of executing complex workflows via standardized protocols (e.g., MCP). However, this paradigm shifts control from deterministic code to probabilistic inference, creating a fundamental Trust-Authorization Mismatch: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we survey more than 200 representative papers to categorize the emerging landscape of agent security. We propose the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework as a unifying formal lens. By decomposing agent execution into three distinct stages-Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant-we demonstrate that diverse threats, from prompt injection to tool poisoning, share a common root cause: the desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization boundaries. Using the B-I-P lens, we systematically map existing attacks and defenses and identify critical gaps where current mechanisms fail to bridge this mismatch. Finally, we outline a research agenda for shifting from static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.</description>

      <title>Data-Chain Backdoor: Do You Trust Diffusion Models as Generative Data Supplier?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative models such as diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation has greatly reduced the cost of data collection and labeling in downstream perception tasks. However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. Publicly available generative models are often reused without verification, raising a fundamental question of their safety and trustworthiness. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chain, namely, Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers in generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. We study two attacker choices to obtain a backdoor-carried generator, training from scratch and fine-tuning. While naive fine-tuning leads to weak inheritance of the backdoor, we find that novel designs in the loss objectives and trigger processing can substantially improve the generator's ability to preserve trigger patterns, making fine-tuning a low-cost attack path. We evaluate the effectiveness of DCB under the standard augmentation protocol and further assess data-scarce settings. Across multiple trigger types, we observe that the trigger pattern can be consistently retained in the synthetic data with attack efficacy comparable to the conventional backdoor attack.</description>

      <title>Towards Cybersecurity Superintelligence: from AI-guided humans to human-guided AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cybersecurity superintelligence -- artificial intelligence exceeding the best human capability in both speed and strategic reasoning -- represents the next frontier in security. This paper documents the emergence of such capability through three major contributions that have pioneered the field of AI Security. First, PentestGPT (2023) established LLM-guided penetration testing, achieving 228.6% improvement over baseline models through an architecture that externalizes security expertise into natural language guidance. Second, Cybersecurity AI (CAI, 2025) demonstrated automated expert-level performance, operating 3,600x faster than humans while reducing costs 156-fold, validated through #1 rankings at international competitions including the $50,000 Neurogrid CTF prize. Third, Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR, 2026) introduces a neurosymbolic architecture embedding game-theoretic reasoning into LLM-based agents: symbolic equilibrium computation augments neural inference, doubling success rates while reducing behavioral variance 5.2x and achieving 2:1 advantage over non-strategic AI in Attack &amp; Defense scenarios. Together, these advances establish a clear progression from AI-guided humans to human-guided game-theoretic cybersecurity superintelligence.</description>

      <title>Reuse of Public Keys Across UTXO and Account-Based Cryptocurrencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that reusing cryptocurrency addresses undermines privacy. This also applies if the same addresses are used in different cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, cross-chain address reuse appears to be a recurring phenomenon, especially in EVM-based designs. Previous works performed either direct address matching, or basic format conversion, to identify such cases. However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we devise novel clustering methods across these different cryptocurrency networks that do not rely on heuristics and instead link entities by their knowledge of the underlying secret key.</description>

      <title>FIPS 204-Compatible Threshold ML-DSA via Masked Lagrange Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present masked Lagrange reconstruction, a technique that enables threshold ML-DSA (FIPS 204) with arbitrary thresholds $T$ while producing standard 3.3 KB signatures verifiable by unmodified FIPS 204 implementations. Concurrent approaches have limitations: Bienstock et al. (ePrint 2025/1163) achieve arbitrary $T$ but require honest-majority and 37-136 rounds; Celi et al. (ePrint 2026/013) achieve dishonest-majority but are limited to $T \leq 6$. Our technique addresses the barrier that Lagrange coefficients grow as $\Theta(q)$ for moderate $T$, making individual contributions too large for ML-DSA's rejection sampling.
  Unlike ECDSA threshold schemes where pairwise masks suffice for correctness, ML-DSA requires solving three additional challenges absent in prior work: (1) rejection sampling on $\|z\|_\infty$ must still pass after masking, (2) the $r_0$-check exposes $c s_2$ enabling key recovery if unprotected, and (3) the resulting Irwin-Hall nonce distribution must preserve EUF-CMA security. We solve all three.
  We instantiate this technique in three deployment profiles with full security proofs. Profile P1 (TEE-assisted) achieves 3-round signing with a trusted coordinator, with EUF-CMA security under Module-SIS. Profile P2 (fully distributed) eliminates hardware trust via MPC in 8 rounds, achieving UC security against malicious adversaries corrupting up to $n-1$ parties. Profile P3 (2PC-assisted) uses lightweight 2PC for the $r_0$-check in 3-5 rounds, achieving UC security under a 1-of-2 CP honest assumption with the best empirical performance (249ms).
  Our scheme requires $|S| \geq T+1$ signers and achieves success rates of 23-32%, matching single-signer ML-DSA.</description>

      <title>TxRay: Agentic Postmortem of Live Blockchain Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has turned blockchains into financial infrastructure, allowing anyone to trade, lend, and build protocols without intermediaries, but this openness exposes pools of value controlled by code. Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.
  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.
  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +22.9pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.</description>

      <title>Efficient Softmax Reformulation for Homomorphic Encryption via Moment Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a prominent framework for privacy-preserving machine learning, enabling inference directly on encrypted data. However, evaluating softmax, a core component of transformer architectures, remains particularly challenging in HE due to its multivariate structure, the large dynamic range induced by exponential functions, and the need for accurate division during normalization. In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference. In particular, it achieves inference accuracy close to that of high-depth exact methods, while requiring substantially lower computational cost through reduced multiplicative depth.</description>

      <title>Time Is All It Takes: Spike-Retiming Attacks on Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

      <title>ZKBoost: Zero-Knowledge Verifiable Training for XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient boosted decision trees, particularly XGBoost, are among the most effective methods for tabular data. As deployment in sensitive settings increases, cryptographic guarantees of model integrity become essential. We present ZKBoost, the first zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) protocol for XGBoost, enabling model owners to prove correct training on a committed dataset without revealing data or parameters. We make three key contributions: (1) a fixed-point XGBoost implementation compatible with arithmetic circuits, enabling instantiation of efficient zkPoT, (2) a generic template of zkPoT for XGBoost, which can be instantiated with any general-purpose ZKP backend, and (3) vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based instantiation resolving challenges in proving nonlinear fixed-point operations. Our fixed-point implementation matches standard XGBoost accuracy within 1\% while enabling practical zkPoT on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Extracting Recurring Vulnerabilities from Black-Box LLM-Generated Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.</description>

      <title>Beware Untrusted Simulators -- Reward-Free Backdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.06618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simple differentially private estimators for the mean and covariance of multivariate sub-Gaussian data that are accurate at small sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms both theoretically and empirically using synthetic and real-world datasets -- showing that their asymptotic error rates match the state-of-the-art theoretical bounds, and that they concretely outperform all previous methods. Specifically, previous estimators either have weak empirical accuracy at small sample sizes, perform poorly for multivariate data, or require the user to provide strong a priori estimates for the parameters.</description>

      <title>Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes are released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Clients Clustering with Adaptation to Data Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains deep models across edge devices without centralizing raw data, preserving user privacy. However, client heterogeneity slows down convergence and limits global model accuracy. Clustered FL (CFL) mitigates this by grouping clients with similar representations and training a separate model for each cluster. In practice, client data evolves over time, a phenomenon we refer to as data drift, which breaks cluster homogeneity and degrades performance. Data drift can take different forms depending on whether changes occur in the output values, the input features, or the relationship between them. We propose FIELDING, a CFL framework for handling diverse types of data drift with low overhead. FIELDING detects drift at individual clients and performs selective re-clustering to balance cluster quality and model performance, while remaining robust to malicious clients and varying levels of heterogeneity. Experiments show that FIELDING improves final model accuracy by 1.9-5.9% and achieves target accuracy 1.16x-2.23x faster than existing state-of-the-art CFL methods.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Linear Time Seeded Extractors with Short Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time $\Omega(n \log(1/\varepsilon))$ and often slower, where $n$ is the input source length and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require $\varepsilon$ to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical.
  Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time $O(n \log^c n)$, for any error $\varepsilon$. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for $n$-bit sources with any min-entropy $k$ and any target error $\varepsilon$ with seed length $d=O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$ and output length $m=(1-\eta)k$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\eta&gt;0$, running in nearly-linear time. When $k$ or $\varepsilon$ are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan's extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most $\frac{n}{\log(1/\varepsilon)polylog(n)}$. Previous fast implementations of Trevisan's extractor ran in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time in this setting.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Noisy Aggregated Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalizing large-scale diffusion models poses serious privacy risks, especially when adapting to small, sensitive datasets. A common approach is to fine-tune the model using differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), but this suffers from severe utility degradation due to the high noise needed for privacy, particularly in the small data regime. We propose an alternative that leverages Textual Inversion (TI), which learns an embedding vector for an image or set of images, to enable adaptation under differential privacy (DP) constraints. Our approach, Differentially Private Aggregation via Textual Inversion (DPAgg-TI), adds calibrated noise to the aggregation of per-image embeddings to ensure formal DP guarantees while preserving high output fidelity. We show that DPAgg-TI outperforms DP-SGD finetuning in both utility and robustness under the same privacy budget, achieving results closely matching the non-private baseline on style adaptation tasks using private artwork from a single artist and Paris 2024 Olympic pictograms. In contrast, DP-SGD fails to generate meaningful outputs in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17461v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centralization enhances the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) but also introduces critical challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy risks, and scalability limitations. To address these issues, blockchain-based Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages decentralization and transparency to improve the trustworthiness of AI systems. Despite rapid adoption in industry, the academic community lacks a systematic analysis of DeAI's technical foundations, opportunities, and challenges. This work presents the first Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on DeAI, offering a formal definition, a taxonomy of existing solutions based on the AI lifecycle, and an in-depth investigation of the roles of blockchain in enabling secure and incentive-compatible collaboration. We further review security risks across the DeAI lifecycle and empirically evaluate representative mitigation techniques. Finally, we highlight open research challenges and future directions for advancing blockchain-based DeAI.</description>

      <title>Blockchain with proof of quantum work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a blockchain architecture in which mining requires a quantum computer. The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave(TM) quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [King et al. Science 2025], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining while providing a quantum-safe layer of security. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.</description>

      <title>Capability-Based Scaling Trends for LLM-Based Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a \emph{weak-to-strong} problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the \emph{capability gap} between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 600 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these observations, we derive a \emph{jailbreaking scaling curve} that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</description>

      <title>AlphaSteer: Learning Refusal Steering with Principled Null-Space Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints. For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AlphaLab-USTC/AlphaSteer.</description>

      <title>Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Giving AI Agents Access to Cryptocurrency and Smart Contracts Creates New Vectors of AI Harm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts that could give rise to these new vectors of AI harm. Next, we describe each of these new vectors of AI harm in detail, providing a first-of-its-kind taxonomy. Finally, we conclude with a call for more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these new vectors of AI , thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.</description>

      <title>Statistical Quantum Mechanics of the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS): A Self-Stabilizing True Uniform RNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS), a novel framework for true uniform randomness generation grounded in statistical quantum mechanics. RPSS is built on a pair of conjugate observables, the permutation count and the elapsed sorting time, whose heavy-tailed raw distributions synchronously converge to uniformity through modular reduction. This mathematically proven convergence establishes RPSS as a True Uniform Random Number Generator (TURNG). A practical implementation, QPP-RNG, demonstrates how intrinsic system jitter, arising from microarchitectural noise, memory latency, and scheduling dynamics, interacts with combinatorial complexity to yield a compact, self-stabilizing entropy source. Empirical validation under the NIST SP 800-90B framework confirms rapid entropy convergence and statistically uniform outputs. RPSS thus defines a new class of quantum-inspired entropy engines, where randomness is simultaneously harvested from unpredictable system jitter and amplified by combinatorial processes, offering a robust, platform-independent alternative to conventional entropy sources.</description>

      <title>GLP: A Grassroots, Multiagent, Concurrent, Logic Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms are distributed systems with multiple instances that can (1) operate independently of each other and of any global resource other than the network, and (2) coalesce into ever larger instances, possibly resulting in a single global instance.
  Here, we present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a multiagent concurrent logic programming language designed for the implementation of grassroots platforms. We introduce the language incrementally: We recall the standard operational semantics of logic programs; introduce the operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP as a restriction of that of LP; recall the notion of multiagent transition systems and atomic transactions; introduce the operational semantics of multiagent GLP via a multiagent transition system specified via atomic transactions; and prove multiagent GLP to be grassroots. The accompanying programming example is the grassroots social graph -- the infrastructure grassroots platform on which all others are based.
  With the mathematical foundations presented here: a workstation-based implementation of Concurrent GLP was developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of Concurrent GLP; a distributed peer-to-peer smartphone-based implementation of multiagent GLP is being developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of multiagent GLP; a moded type system for GLP was implemented by AI, to facilitate the specification of GLP programs by human and AI designers, for their programming by AI; all reported in detail in companion papers.</description>

      <title>Randomized Masked Finetuning: An Efficient Way to Mitigate Memorization of PIIs in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Soft Prompts for Privacy Attacks in Federated Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference attack (MIA) poses a significant privacy threat in federated learning (FL) as it allows adversaries to determine whether a client's private dataset contains a specific data sample. While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Generalizability and Membership Privacy Risks in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep learning model usually has to sacrifice some utilities when it acquires some other abilities or characteristics. Privacy preservation has such trade-off relationships with utilities. The loss disparity between various defense approaches implies the potential to decouple generalizability and privacy risks to maximize privacy gain. In this paper, we identify that the model's generalization and privacy risks exist in different regions in deep neural network architectures. Based on the observations that we investigate, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training Principle (PPTP) to protect model components from privacy risks while minimizing the loss in generalizability. Through extensive evaluations, our approach shows significantly better maintenance in model generalizability while enhancing privacy preservation.</description>
