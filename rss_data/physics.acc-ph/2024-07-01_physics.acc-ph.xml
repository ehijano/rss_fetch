      <title>Development of Rotating Target with Ferrofluid Seal for ILC Electron-Driven Positron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ILC electron-driven positron source, acceleration tubes are located immediately downstream of the positron generation target to capture the generated positrons, necessitating high vacuum for their operation. We designed a rotating target using a ferrofluid rotating vacuum seal that can stably maintain a vacuum of 10-6 Pa and a tangential velocity of 5 m/sec, which meets the requirements of the ILC positron source. We fabricated a full-scale prototype and confirmed the compatibility of rotation and stable vacuum maintenance. Various tests on the radiation resistance of the ferrofluid demonstrated its ability to withstand six years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation without degradation and to continue exhibiting vacuum sealing performance. Radiation exposure tests on a small-scale target with a structure and material similar to the full-scale target confirmed its operability after two years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation. The design, including thermal load, stress analysis, and cooling, led to the conclusion of an estimated lifespan of the target of over one year, based on comparison with the SLC target. These results demonstrate and establish the technology of positron generation targets in the ILC electron-driven positron source.</description>

      <title>On-chip high energy photon radiation source based on microwave-dielectric undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new on-chip light source configuration has been proposed, which utilizes the interaction between microwave and a dielectric nanopillar array to generate a periodic electromagnetic near field, and applies periodic transverse acceleration to relativistic electrons to generate high-energy photon radiation. Here the dielectric nanopillar array interacting with microwave acts as the electron undulator, in which the near field drives electrons to oscillate. When an electron beam operates in this nanopillar array in this light source configuration, it is subjected to a periodic transverse near-field force, and will radiate X-ray or even gamma-ray high energy photons after a relativistic frequency up-conversion. Compared with the laser-dielectric undulator based on the interaction between strong lasers and nanostructures to generate a plasmonic near field, this configuration is less prone to damage during operation.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of dark current from an S-band rf gun with exchangeable photocathode system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field emission or dark current from RF electron guns is problematic for accelerators for several reasons, and can be more difficult to predict, measure and understand, compared to the main beam. The work presented here is a study of the dark current emitted from the CLARA 3GHz 2.5 cell electron gun with exchangeable photocathode, which is a type of gun used for single pass high quality low emittance beams for uses such as Free Electron Lasers. The main purpose of these studies was to identify sources of dark current emission within the gun, by examining the dark current distribution and patterns on scintillating screens. It is shown that the features of the patterns can be reproduced qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively, by finite element simulations. Thus, certain surfaces within the gun and cathode apparatus which contribute most significantly to problematic dark current can be identified, and further development and preparation of the guns and their cathodes can be informed to minimise dark current.</description>

      <title>Extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy using an ultrashort pulse laboratory-scale laser-plasma accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven compact particle accelerators can provide ultrashort pulses of broadband X-rays, well suited for undertaking X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on a femtosecond timescale. Here the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) features of the K-edge of a copper sample have been observed over a 250 eV window in a single shot using a laser wakefield accelerator, providing information on both the electronic and ionic structure simultaneously. This unique capability will allow the investigation of ultrafast processes, and in particular, probing high-energy-density matter and physics far-from-equilibrium where the sample refresh rate is slow and shot number is limited. For example, states that replicate the tremendous pressures and temperatures of planetary bodies or the conditions inside nuclear fusion reactions. Using high-power lasers to pump these samples also has the advantage of being inherently synchronised to the laser-driven X-ray probe. A perspective on the additional strengths of a laboratory-based ultrafast X-ray absorption source is presented.</description>
