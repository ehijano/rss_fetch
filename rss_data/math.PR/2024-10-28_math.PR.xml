      <title>The directed landscape seen from its trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic question about the directed landscape is how much of it can be reconstructed simply by knowing the shapes of its geodesics. We prove that the directed landscape can be reconstructed from the shapes of its semi-infinite geodesics. In order to show this result, we make use of the Busemann process of the directed landscape together with a novel ``coordinate system" and ``differential distance" to capture the behaviour of semi-infinite geodesics.</description>

      <title>The Free Energy of the Elastic Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of three papers about the Elastic Manifold model. This classical model proposes a rich picture due to the competition between the inherent disorder and the smoothing effect of elasticity. In this paper, we prove a Parisi formula, i.e. we compute the asymptotic quenched free energy and show it is given by the solution to a certain variational problem.
  This work comes after a long and distinguished line of work in the Physics literature, going back to the 1980's (including the foundational work by Daniel Fisher [29], Marc Mezard and Giorgio Parisi [50, 51], and more recently by Yan Fyodorov and Pierre Le Doussal [34, 35]. Even though the mathematical study of Spin Glasses has seen deep progress in the recent years, after the celebrated work by Michel Talagrand [67, 68], the Elastic Manifold model has been studied from a mathematical perspective, only recently and at zero temperature. The annealed topological complexity has been computed, by the first author with Paul Bourgade and Benjamin McKenna [15, 16]. Here we begin the study of this model at positive temperature by computing the quenched free energy.
  We obtain our Parisi formula by first applying Laplace's method to reduce the question to a related new family of spherical Spin Glass models with an elastic interaction. The upper bound is then obtained through an interpolation argument initially developed by Francisco Guerra [42] for the study of Spin Glasses. The lower bound follows by adapting the cavity method along the lines explored by Wei-Kuo Chen [23] and the multi-species synchronization method of Dmitry Panchenko [55]. In our next papers [19, 20] we will analyze the consequences of this Parisi formula.</description>

      <title>Boundary trace theorems for symmetric reflected diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with a transient irreducible diffusion process $X^0$ on a locally compact separable metric space $(D, d)$, one can construct a canonical symmetric reflected diffusion process $\bar X$ on a completion $D^*$ of $(D, d)$ through the theory of reflected Dirichlet spaces. The boundary trace process $\check X$ of $X$ on the boundary $\partial D:=D^*\setminus D$ is the reflected diffusion process $\bar X$ time-changed by a smooth measure $\nu$ having full quasi-support on $\partial D$. The Dirichlet form of the trace process $\check X$ is called the trace Dirichlet form. In the first part of the paper, we give a Besov space type characterization of the domain of the trace Dirichlet form for any good smooth measure $\nu$ on the boundary $\partial D$. In the second part of this paper, we study properties of the harmonic measure of $\bar X$ on the boundary $\partial D$. In particular, we provide a condition equivalent to the doubling property of the harmonic measure. Finally, we characterize and provide estimates of the jump kernel of the trace Dirichlet form under the doubling condition of the harmonic measure on $\partial D$.</description>

      <title>Moments of Gamma type and three-parametric Mittag-Leffler function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of positive random variables having moments of Gamma type, whose density can be expressed by the three-parametric Mittag-Leffler functions. We give some necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for their existence. As a corollary, we give some conditions for non-negativity of the three-parametric Mittag-Leffler functions. As an application, we study the infinite divisibility of the powers of half $\a$-Cauchy variable. In addition, we find that a random variable $\X$ having moment of Gamma type if and only if $\log \X$ is quasi infinitely divisible. From this perspective, we can solve many Hausdorff moment problems of sequences of factorial ratios.</description>

      <title>Invariant Manifolds for Random Parabolic Evolution Equations with almost sectorial operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a way of analyzing the random dynamics of stochastic evolution equations with a non-dense domain. Such problems cover several types of evolution equations. We are particularly interested in evolution equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions of white noise type. We prove the existence of stable, unstable, and center manifolds around a stationary trajectory by combining integrated semigroup theory and invariant manifold theory. The results are applied to stochastic parabolic equations with white noise at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Probability Proofs for Stirling (and More): the Ubiquitous Role of $\mathbf{\sqrt{2\pi}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stirling approximation formula for $n!$ dates from 1730. Here we give new and instructive proofs of this and related approximation formulae via tools of probability and statistics. There are connections to the Central Limit Theorem and also to approximations of marginal distributions in Bayesian setups. Certain formulae emerge by working through particular instances, some independently verifiable but others perhaps not. A particular case yielding new formulae is that of summing independent uniforms, related to the Irwin--Hall distribution. Yet further proofs of the Stirling flow from examining aspects of limiting normality of the sample median of uniforms, and from these again we find a proof for the Wallis product formula for $\pi$.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of semi-discrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the breakdown point for solutions of semi-discrete optimal transport problems, which characterizes the robustness of the multivariate quantiles based on optimal transport proposed in Ghosal and Sen (2022). We do so under very mild assumptions: the absolutely continuous reference measure is only assumed to have a support that is compact and convex, whereas the target measure is a general discrete measure on a finite number, $n$ say, of atoms. The breakdown point depends on the target measure only through its probability weights (hence not on the location of the atoms) and involves the geometry of the reference measure through the Tukey (1975) concept of halfspace depth. Remarkably, depending on this geometry, the breakdown point of the optimal transport median can be strictly smaller than the breakdown point of the univariate median or the breakdown point of the spatial median, namely~$\lceil n/2\rceil /2$. In the context of robust location estimation, our results provide a subtle insight on how to perform multivariate trimming when constructing trimmed means based on optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Q-fractional Brownian motion on the sphere: regularity and fast simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extension of isotropic Gaussian random fields and Q-Wiener processes on d-dimensional spheres, isotropic Q-fractional Brownian motion is introduced and sample H\"older regularity in space-time is shown depending on the regularity of the spatial covariance operator Q and the Hurst parameter H. The processes are approximated by a spectral method in space for which strong and almost sure convergence are shown. The underlying sample paths of fractional Brownian motion are simulated by circulant embedding or conditionalized random midpoint displacement. Temporal convergence and computational complexity are numerically tested, the latter matching the complexity of simulating a Q-Wiener process if allowing for a temporal error.</description>

      <title>Local hedging approximately solves Pandora's box problems with nonobligatory inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider search problems with nonobligatory inspection and single-item or combinatorial selection. A decision maker is presented with a number of items, each of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to observe the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the decision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the decision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints. In our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items without first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory inspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for which the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and approximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.
  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good approximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging transforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the nonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the approximation ratio. The factor is instance-dependent but is at most 4/3. We thus obtain the first approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial selection problems, including matroid basis, matching, and facility location.</description>

Abstract: A new 2 parameter unit Weibull distribution is defined on the unit interval (0,1). The methodology of deducing its PDF, some of its properties and related functions are discussed. The paper is supplied by many figures illustrating the new distribution and how this can make it illegible to fit a wide range of skewed data.

      <title>Probabilistic Representation of Commutative Quantum Circuit Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In commuting parametric quantum circuits, the Fourier series of the pairwise fidelity can be expressed as the characteristic function of random variables. Furthermore, expressiveness can be cast as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. This construction has been successfully applied to the group composed only of Pauli-Z rotations, and we generalize this probabilistic strategy to any commuting set of Pauli operators. We utilize an efficient algorithm by van den Berg and Temme (2020) using the tableau representation of Pauli strings to yield a unitary from the Clifford group that, under conjugation, simultaneously diagonalizes our commuting set of Pauli rotations. Furthermore, we fully characterize the underlying distribution of the random walk using stabilizer states and their basis state representations. This would allow us to tractably compute the lattice volume and variance matrix used to express the frame potential. Together, this demonstrates a scalable strategy to calculate the expressiveness of parametric quantum models.</description>

Abstract: We study variants of a stochastic game inspired by backgammon where players may propose to double the stake, with the game state dictated by a one-dimensional random walk. Our variants allow for different numbers of proposals and different multipliers to the stake. We determine the optimal game state for proposing and accepting, giving analytic solutions in many variants. We also introduce a 3-player generalization of the game and prove basic results about its behavior, in addition to providing a simulation.</description>

      <title>Negative regularity mixing for random volume preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the negative regularity mixing properties of random volume preserving diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold without boundary. We give general criteria so that the associated random transfer operator mixes $H^{-\delta}$ observables exponentially fast in $H^{-\delta}$ (with a deterministic rate), a property that is false in the deterministic setting. The criteria apply to a wide variety of random diffeomorphisms, such as discrete-time iid random diffeomorphisms, the solution maps of suitable classes of stochastic differential equations, and to the case of advection-diffusion by solutions of the stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb T^2$. In the latter case, we show that the zero diffusivity passive scalar with a stochastic source possesses a unique stationary measure describing "ideal" scalar turbulence. The proof is based on techniques inspired by the use of pseudodifferential operators and anisotropic Sobolev spaces in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a model of Galton Watson processes in dynamical environments where the environment evolves according to a dynamical system (X, T). Three behaviours are possible: uniformly subcritical, critical, and uniformly supercritical. We study the extinction probability q in the uniformly supercritical case. In particular, we investigate the regularity of this application as a function of the environment x. In the critical case, we study the set of bad environments N (where the probability of extinction is one), which is T -invariant. We give its Hausdorff dimension in some cases.</description>

      <title>A comparison principle based on couplings of partial integro-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a comparison principle for viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ), -Bellman (HJB), and -Isaacs (HJI) equations for general classes of partial integro-differential operators. Our approach innovates in three ways: (1) We reinterpret the classical doubling-of-variables method in the context of second-order equations by casting the Ishii-Crandall Lemma into a test function framework. This adaptation allows us to effectively handle non-local integral operators, such as those associated with L\'evy processes. (2) We translate the key estimate on the difference of Hamiltonians in terms of an adaptation of the probabilistic notion of couplings, providing a unified approach that applies to differential, difference, and integral operators. (3) We strengthen the sup-norm contractivity resulting from the comparison principle to one that encodes continuity in the strict topology. We apply our theory to a variety of examples, in particular, to second-order differential operators and, more generally, generators of spatially inhomogeneous L\'evy processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a general L\'evy process model of the bail-out optimal dividend problem with an exponential time horizon, and further extends it to the regime-switching model. We first show the optimality of a double barrier strategy in the single-regime setting with a concave terminal payoff function. This is then applied to show the optimality of a Markov-modulated double barrier strategy in the regime-switching model via contraction mapping arguments. We solve these for a general L\'evy model with both positive and negative jumps, greatly generalizing the existing results on spectrally one-sided models.</description>

      <title>Detecting adversarial attacks on random samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of detecting adversarial perturbations in a sequence of observations. Given a data sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ drawn from a standard normal distribution, an adversary, after observing the sample, can perturb each observation by a fixed magnitude or leave it unchanged. We explore the relationship between the perturbation magnitude, the sparsity of the perturbation, and the detectability of the adversary's actions, establishing precise thresholds for when detection becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability of cells for the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>

      <title>Critical percolation on slabs with random columnar disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a bond percolation model on slabs $\mathbb{S}^+_k=\mathbb{Z}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$ featuring one-dimensional inhomogeneities. In this context, a vertical column on the slab comprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of a renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a power law with exponent $\alpha&gt;1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows: vertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$ (respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within unselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability $p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\alpha$ (depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if $q&gt;p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than $p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.</description>

      <title>Rate-optimal estimation of mixed semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the sum $Y=B+B(H)$ of a Brownian motion $B$ and an independent fractional Brownian motion $B(H)$ with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$. Even though $B(H)$ is not a semimartingale, it was shown in [\textit{Bernoulli} \textbf{7} (2001) 913--934] that $Y$ is a semimartingale if $H&gt;3/4$. Moreover, $Y$ is locally equivalent to $B$ in this case, so $H$ cannot be consistently estimated from local observations of $Y$. This paper pivots on another unexpected feature in this model: if $B$ and $B(H)$ become correlated, then $Y$ will never be a semimartingale, and $H$ can be identified, regardless of its value. This and other results will follow from a detailed statistical analysis of a more general class of processes called \emph{mixed semimartingales}, which are semiparametric extensions of $Y$ with stochastic volatility in both the martingale and the fractional component. In particular, we derive consistent estimators and feasible central limit theorems for all parameters and processes that can be identified from high-frequency observations. We further show that our estimators achieve optimal rates in a minimax sense.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann-Grad Limit of the Lorentz Gas in a Union of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz gas describes an ensemble of noninteracting point particles in an infinite array of spherical scatterers. In the present paper we consider the case when the scatterer configuration P is a fixed union of (translated) lattices in R^d, and prove that in the limit of low scatterer density, the particle dynamics converges to a random flight process. In the special case when the lattices in P are pairwise incommensurable, this settles a conjecture from [20]. The proof is carried out by applying a framework developed in recent work by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson [21], and central parts of our proof are the construction of an admissible marking of the point set P, and the verification of the uniform spherical equidistribution condition required in [21]. Regarding the random flight process obtained in the low density limit of the Lorentz gas, we prove that it can be reconstructed from the corresponding limiting flight processes arising from the individual commensurability classes of lattices in P. We furthermore prove that the free path lengths of the limit flight process have a distribution with a power law tail, whose exponent depends on the number of commensurability classes in P.</description>

      <title>On the saddle point of a zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a saddle point in a class of zero-sum games between a stopper and a singular-controller. The underlying dynamics is a one-dimensional, time-homogeneous, singularly controlled diffusion taking values either on $\mathbb{R}$ or on $[0,\infty)$. The games are set on a finite-time horizon, thus leading to analytical problems in the form of parabolic variational inequalities with gradient and obstacle constraints. The saddle point is characterised in terms of two moving boundaries: an optimal stopping boundary and an optimal control boundary. These boundaries allow us to construct an optimal stopping time for the stopper and an optimal control for the singular-controller. Our method relies on a new link between the value function of the game and the value function of an auxiliary optimal stopping problem with absorption. We show that the smooth-fit condition at the stopper's optimal boundary (in the game), translates into an absorption condition in the auxiliary problem. This is somewhat in contrast with results obtained in problems of singular control with absorption and it highlights the key role of smooth-fit in this context.</description>

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both local exploration of the state space and global discovery of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for adjusting an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>
