      <title>A universal splitting of string and particle scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new splitting behavior of tree-level string/particle amplitudes for scalars, gluons and gravitons. We identify certain subspaces in the space of Mandelstam variables, where the universal Koba-Nielsen factor splits into two parts (each with an off-shell leg). Both open- and closed-string amplitudes with Parke-Taylor factors naturally factorize into two stringy ${\it currents}$, which implies the splitting of bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ amplitudes and via a simple deformation to unified stringy amplitudes, the splitting of amplitudes in the non-linear sigma model and Yang-Mills-scalar theory; the same splitting holds for scalar amplitudes without color such as the special Galileon. Remarkably, if we impose similar constraints on Lorentz products involving polarizations, gluon and graviton amplitudes in bosonic string and superstring theories also split into two (stringy) currents. A special case of the splitting implies soft theorems, and more generally it extends recently proposed smooth splittings and new factorizations near zeros to all these theories.</description>

      <title>On a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term in 10d heterotic string theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the low-energy effective actions of two ten-dimensional supersymmetric heterotic strings are different by a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term even after we turn off the $E_8\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. This will be demonstrated by considering the inflow of normal bundle anomaly to the respective NS5-branes from the bulk. We also find that the $Spin(16)\times Spin(16)$ non-tachyonic non-supersymmetric heterotic string has the same non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term. We will also explain the relation of our findings to the theory of topological modular forms.
  The paper is written as a string theory paper, except for an appendix translating the content in mathematical terms. We will explain there that our finding identifies a representative of the $\mathbb{Z}/3$-torsion element of $\pi_{-32}\mathrm{TMF}$ as a particular self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of $c=16$ and how we utilize string duality to arrive at this statement.</description>

      <title>Particle-Soliton Degeneracies from Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-invertible topological symmetry operators in massive quantum field theories in (1+1) dimensions. In phases where this symmetry is spontaneously broken we show that the particle spectrum often has degeneracies dictated by the non-invertible symmetry and we deduce a procedure to determine the allowed multiplets. These degeneracies are robust predictions and do not require integrability or other special features of renormalization group flows. We exhibit these conclusions in examples where the spectrum is known, recovering soliton and particle degeneracies. For instance, the Tricritical Ising model deformed by the subleading Z2 odd operator flows to a gapped phase with two degenerate vacua. This flow enjoys a Fibonacci fusion category symmetry which implies a threefold degeneracy of its particle states, relating the mass of solitons interpolating between vacua and particles supported in a single vacuum.</description>

      <title>Compton scattering from superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

      <title>Barrow Entropy and AdS Black Holes in RPS Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics for charged AdS black holes by considering the impact of quantum gravity on the event horizon area. The primary aim of this work is to elucidate the influence of quantum gravitational effects on thermodynamic behaviors, critical phenomena, phase transitions, and the stability of black holes. We observe that charged AdS black holes exhibit thermodynamic behavior similar to that of Van der Waals fluids when influenced by quantum gravity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel black hole thermodynamic phenomenon, which we term ``resistance of phase transitions". Our study uncovers a violation of the homogeneity property of the Smarr relation in RPS thermodynamics due to the effects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon theory in noncommutative phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the three-dimensional noncommutative relations of the positions and momenta operators to those in the four dimension. Using the Bopp shift technique, we give the Heisenberg representation of these noncommutative algebras and endow the noncommutative parameters associated with the Planck constant, Planck length and cosmological constant. As an analog with the electromagnetic gauge potential, the noncommutative effect can be interpreted as an effective gauge field, which depends on the Plank constant and cosmological constant. Based on these noncommutative relations, we give the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation and its corresponding current continuity equation in the noncommutative phase space including the canonical and Hamiltonian forms and their novel properties beyond the conventional KG equation. We analyze the symmetries of the KG equations and some observables such as velocity and force of free particles in the noncommutative phase space. We give the perturbation solution of the KG equation.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Page Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Page curve describing the process of black hole evaporation is derived in terms of a family, parametrized in terms of the evaporation time, of finite type II_1 factors, associated, respectively, to the entanglement wedges of the black hole and the radiation. The so defined Page curve measures the relative continuous dimension of the black hole and the radiation along the evaporation process. The transfer of information is quantitatively defined in terms of the Murray von Neumann parameter describing the change of the spatial properties of the factors during the evaporation. In the simplest case the generator of the evaporation process is defined in terms of the action of the fundamental group of the hyperfinite type II_1 factor. In this setup the Page curve describes a phase transition with the transfer of information as order parameter. We discuss the limits of either a type I or a type III description of the black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Theta Dependence in the Presence of Massless Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if there are conserved flavor symmetries then some properties of a monopole can depend on $\theta$ even when a fermion is massless. The quantized nature of global symmetries and the fractional nature of the Witten effect can lead to interesting structure. Seen from another point of view, aside from possibly breaking baryon and lepton flavor symmetries (the Callan-Rubakov effect), monopole boundary conditions can also break the axial symmetry that otherwise could have been used to remove $\theta$ from the Lagrangian. As an example, in a toy model, we calculate the $\theta$ dependence of the mass of the monopole and properties of the non-zero charge density surrounding the monopole.</description>

      <title>A perturbative approach to the non-relativistic string spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we use a perturbative approach to find the spectrum of non-relativistic strings in the String Newton-Cartan (SNC) AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ spacetime. We perturb the bosonic sector of the action around a BMN-like folded string solution in light-cone gauge. We find strong evidence that the theory is described by a combination of massive and massless free fields in an anti-de Sitter background by showing that interaction terms up to six scalars vanish after field redefinitions.</description>

      <title>Tree-Level Superstring Amplitudes: The Neveu-Schwarz Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete computation of superstring scattering amplitudes at tree level, for the case of Neveu-Schwarz insertions. Mathematically, this is to say that we determine explicitly the superstring measure on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,n,0}$ of super Riemann surfaces of genus zero with $n \ge 3$ Neveu-Schwarz punctures. While, of course, an expression for the measure was previously known, we do this from first principles, using the canonically defined super Mumford isomorphism. We thus determine the scattering amplitudes, explicitly in the global coordinates on $\mathcal{M}_{0,n,0}$, without the need for picture changing operators or ghosts, and are also able to determine canonically the value of the coupling constant. Our computation should be viewed as a step towards performing similar analysis on $\mathcal{M}_{0,0,n}$, to derive explicit tree-level scattering amplitudes with Ramond insertions.</description>

      <title>Generating functional of correlators of twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending our previous work in pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory, we compute the generating functional of correlators of collinear twist-$2$ operators that enter the components of balanced superfields -- i.e., superfields with an equal number of dotted and undotted indices in their spinor representation -- in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY SU($N$) YM theory in Minkowskian and Euclidean space-time, in the conformal limit and renormalization-group improved form, and to the leading and next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. The latter calculation sets strong UV asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY YM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

      <title>On spontaneous breaking of the $\text{SO}(2N)$ symmetry in the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a diffferent critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of this paper centers around the tension between confinement and freedom in QCD. I discuss how it can be understood heuristically as a manifestation of self-adhesive glue and how it fits within the larger contexts of energy-time uncertainty and $\textit{real virtuality}$. I discuss the possible emergence of $\textit{treeons}$ as a tangible ingredient of (at least) pure gluon $SU(3)$. I propose $\textit{flux channeling}$ as a method to address that and allied questions about triality flux numerically, and indicate how to implement it for electric and magnetic flux in material systems. That bulk is framed with broad-stroke, necessarily selective sketches of the past and possible future of strong interaction physics. At the end, I've added an expression of gratitude for my formative experience at the Erice school, in 1973.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Hexadecapole at the heart of nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical Maxwell's electromagnetism, monopole term of the electric field is proportional to $r^{-2}$, while higher order multipole terms, sourced by anisotropic sources, fall-off faster. However, in nonlinear electromagnetism even a spherically symmetric field has multipole-like contributions. We prove that the leading subdominant term of the electric field, defined by nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian obeying Maxwellian weak field limit, in a static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime, is of the order $O(r^{-6})$ as $r \to \infty$. Moreover, using Lagrange inversion theorem and Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, we derive the series expansion of the electric field from the Taylor series of an analytic electromagnetic Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry Fractionalization and Foliated Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability of N=1 supersymmetric Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body models based upon the potentials W(x)=2/x, W(x)=2/sin(x), and W(x)=2/sinh(x) is proven. The problem of constructing an algebraically resolvable set of Grassmann-odd constants of motion is reduced to finding a triplet of vectors such that all their scalar products can be expressed in terms of the original bosonic first integrals. The supersymmetric generalizations are used to build novel integrable (iso)spin extensions of the respective Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study on the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave generated by coalescing spinless binary systems up to the third post-Minkowskian approximation in the effective one-body theory. To derive an analytical expansion of the null tetrad components of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor $\varPsi_{4}$ in the effective spacetime, we utilize the method proposed by Sasaki $et$ $al.$ During this investigation, we discover more general integral formulas that provide a theoretical framework for computing the results in any order. Subsequently, we successfully compute the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave, which include the results of the Schwarzschild case and the correction terms resulting from the dimensionless parameters $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ in the effective metric.</description>

Abstract: The paper discusses an applicability criterion for a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation in the Euclidean space with a dimension larger than two. It is shown that the set of functions satisfying the criterion is not empty. As an example, an explicit function is presented.

      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice models and capable of resolving this issue.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al.~[1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.03 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.07$. However, as first noted in~[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the four-dimensional effective field theory arising from heterotic string theory is general relativity with both a Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet term. We study the propagation of gravitational waves in this combination of Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, both of which have an associated scalar field, the axion and the dilaton respectively, that are kinetically coupled. We review how the combination of dynamical Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravities can arise from string theory as corrections to general relativity and show how the gravitational wave waveform is modified in such a theory. We compare our results to a novel framework recently introduced for parametrizing the parity-violating sector (Chern-Simons), and use that to guide our construction of a similar parametrization for the parity-conserving (Gauss-Bonnet) sector. In general, we find that the contributions from the parity-violating and parity-conserving sectors are similar. Moreover, the kinetic coupling between the axion and dilaton introduces an extra contribution to the parity-violating sector of the gravitational waves. Using our parametrization, we are able to comment on initial constraints for the theory parameters, including the time variations of the axion and dilaton.</description>

      <title>PeV-Scale SUSY and Cosmic Strings from F-term Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and SUSY breaking in the context of a B-L extension of MSSM which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The hidden sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be consistent with data, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range (1.2-100) TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of B-L cosmic strings. If these are metastable they interpret the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with dimensionless tension Gmu~(1-9.2)x10^-8. The mu parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about 71 GeV. Due to the prolonged matter dominated era the gravitational wave signal is suppressed at high frequencies. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis aimed at verifying the validity of Birkhoff's theorem within the framework of JT (Jackiw-Teitelboim) gravity, a two-dimensional model serving as a simplified platform for studying gravitational dynamics. Birkhoff's theorem, originally formulated in four-dimensional general relativity, asserts the uniqueness of spherically symmetric vacuum solutions. However, its applicability to lower-dimensional gravitational theories, such as JT gravity, remains unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the behavior of spherically symmetric solutions within the JT gravity framework. Employing analytical techniques , we examine the dependence of the gravitational potential on radial distance and assess the time-independence and asymptotic flatness of the solutions. Our results reveal that spherically symmetric solutions in JT gravity indeed exhibit properties consistent with Birkhoff's theorem, validating its applicability in two-dimensional gravitational dynamics. This verification not only enhances our understanding of gravitational phenomena in lower dimensions but also contributes to the broader exploration of gravitational theories and their implications for holography, quantum gravity, and related areas of theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>A generalized dominance ordering for 1/2-BPS states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a generalized dominance ordering for irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ with the aim of distinguishing the corresponding states in the 1/2-BPS sector of $U(N)$ Super Yang-Mills theory when a certain finite number of Casimir operators are known. Having knowledge of a restricted set of Casimir operators was proposed as a mechanism for information loss in this sector and its dual gravity theory in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$. It is well-known that the states in this sector are labeled by Young diagrams with $n$ boxes. We propose a generalization of the well-known dominance ordering of Young diagrams. Using this generalization, we posit a conjecture to determine an upper bound for the number of Casimir operators needed to distinguish between the 1/2-BPS states and thus also between their duals in the gravity theory. We offer numerical and analytic evidence for the conjecture. Lastly, we discuss implications of this conjecture when the energy $n$ of the states is asymptotically large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $1/N$ expansion of matrix models is asymptotic, and it requires non-perturbative corrections due to large $N$ instantons. Explicit expressions for large $N$ instanton amplitudes are known in the case of Hermitian matrix models with one cut, but not in the multi-cut case. We show that the recent exact results on topological string instanton amplitudes provide the non-perturbative contributions of large $N$ instantons in generic multi-cut, Hermitian matrix models. We present a detailed test in the case of the cubic matrix model by considering the asymptotics of its $1/N$ expansion, which we obtain at relatively high genus for a generic two-cut background. These results can be extended to certain non-conventional matrix models which admit a topological string theory description. As an application, we determine the large $N$ instanton corrections for the free energy of ABJM theory on the three-sphere, which correspond to D-brane instanton corrections in superstring theory. We also illustrate the applications of topological string instantons in a more mathematical setting by considering orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. By focusing on the example of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$, we show that they grow doubly-factorially with the genus and we obtain and test explicit asymptotic formulae for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix configurations define noncommutative spaces endowed with extra structure including a generalized Laplace operator, and hence a metric structure. Made dynamical via matrix models, they describe rich physical systems including noncommutative gauge theory and emergent gravity. Refining the construction in [1], we construct a semi-classical limit through an immersed submanifold of complex projective space based on quasi-coherent states. We observe the phenomenon of oxidation, where the resulting semi-classical space acquires spurious extra dimensions. We propose to remove this artifact by passing to a leaf of a carefully chosen foliation, which allows to extract the geometrical content of the noncommutative spaces. This is demonstrated numerically via multiple examples.</description>

Abstract: We study $T\bar{T}$-deformed $O(N)$ scalar field theory in two-dimensional spacetime using the functional renormalization group. We derive the $\beta$ functions for the couplings in the system and explore the fixed points. In addition to the Gaussian (trivial) fixed point, we find a nontrivial fixed point at which a new universality class exists. The deformation parameter becomes relevant at the nontrivial fixed point. Therefore, the $T\bar T$-deformed scalar field theory in two-dimensional spacetime could be defined as a nonperturbatively renormalizable theory.</description>

      <title>Democratic actions with scalar fields: symmetric sigma models, supergravity actions and the effective theory of the type IIB superstring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dualization of the scalar fields of a theory into (d-2)-form potentials preserving all the global symmetries is one of the main problems in the construction of democratic pseudoactions containing simultaneously all the original fields and their duals. We study this problem starting with the simplest cases and we show how it can be solved for scalars parametrizing Riemannian symmetric sigma-models as in maximal and half-maximal supergravities. Then, we use this result to write democratic pseudoactions for theories in which the scalars are non-minimally coupled to (p+1)-form potentials in any dimension. These results include a proposal of democratic pseudoaction for the generic bosonic sector of 4-dimensional maximal and half-maximal ungauged supergravities. Furthermore, we propose a democratic pseudoaction for the bosonic sector of N=2B,d=10 supergravity (the effective action of the type IIB superstring theory) containing two 0-, two 2-, one 4-, two 6- and three 8-forms which is manifestly invariant under global SL(2,R) transformations.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Soft Hair on Robinson-Trautman Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 4 dimensional $(4d$) gravitational waves (GWs) with compact wavefronts, generalizing Robinson-Trautman (RT) solutions in Einstein gravity with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We construct the most general solution of the GWs in the presence of a causal, timelike, or null boundary when the usual tensor modes are turned off. Our solution space besides the shape and topology of the wavefront which is a generic compact, smooth, and orientable $2d$ surface $\Sigma$, is specified by a vector over $\Sigma$ satisfying the conformal Killing equation and two scalars that are arbitrary functions over the causal boundary, the boundary modes (soft hair). We work out the symplectic form over the solution space using covariant phase space formalism and analyze the boundary symmetries and charges. The algebra of surface charges is a Heisenberg algebra. Only the overall size of the compact wavefront and not the details of its shape appears in the boundary symplectic form and is canonical conjugate to the overall mass of the GW. Hence, the information about the shape of the wavefront can't be probed by the boundary observer. We construct a boundary energy-momentum tensor and a boundary current, whose conservation yields the RT equation for both asymptotically AdS and flat spacetimes. The latter provides a hydrodynamic description for our RT solutions.</description>

Abstract: Carroll black holes with an associated Carroll temperature were introduced recently. So far, it is unclear if they exhibit a Hawking-like effect. To solve this, we study scalar fields on Carroll black hole backgrounds. Inspired by anomaly methods, we derive a Hawking-like energy-momentum tensor compatible with the Carroll temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Key steps in our derivation are the finiteness of energy at the Carroll extremal surface and compatibility with the Carroll Ward identities, thereby eliminating, respectively, the Carroll-analogs of the Boulware and Unruh vacua.</description>

      <title>New supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $N=(1,1)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries. By considering a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant sector, we find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing a topological twist along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ and a Kahler four-cycle, the twist is implemented by $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge field while, for $\mathcal{M}_4$ given by a Clayley four-cycle, the twist is performed by turning on $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge fields. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacua. Among these solutions, there are solutions interpolating between both of the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua and near horizon geometries. The solutions can also be interpreted as holographic RG flows from five-dimensional SCFTs to superconformal quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study marginal deformations of ${\cal N}=2$, $d=4$ long linear quiver CFTs using the holographic description. We find a two-parameter family of AdS$_5$ solutions that generically break all of supersymmetry, but preserve ${\cal N}=1$ for a particular tuning of the parameters. We study the G-structure of the ${\cal N}=2$ ``parent'' and the ${\cal N}=1$ backgrounds and carefully discuss the quantisation of charges in all cases. For the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=0$ cases, a picture emerges with ``branes" back-reacted on either a spindle or its higher dimensional analogue. Comments on the marginally deformed dual CFTs are given, together with the study of some observables.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real scalar inflation from preheating of LATTICEEASY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a detailed study of real scalar inflation by employing LATTICEEASY simulations to investigate preheating phenomena. Generally, the scalar inflation potential with non-minimal coupling can be approximated by a quartic potential. We observe that the evolutionary behavior of this potential remains unaffected by the coupling coefficient. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions for the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar power ratio (r) are also independent of this coefficient. Consequently, the coefficients of this model are not constrained by Planck observations. Fortunately, the properties of preheating after inflation provide a viable approach to examine these coefficients. Through LATTICEEASY simulations, we trace the evolution of particle number density, scale factor, and energy density during the preheating process. Subsequently, we derive the parameters, such as the energy ratio ($\gamma$) and the e-folding number of preheating ($N_{pre}$), which facilitate further predictions of $n_s$ and $r$. We have successfully validated real scalar inflation model using preheating of LATTICEEASY simulations based on the analytical relationship between preheating and inflation models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction in Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Renyi entropy in a one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model by employing a swapping operator acting on the states which are prepared from the neural network methods. In the static ground state, Renyi entropy can uncover the critical point of the quantum phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. At the critical point, the relation between the Renyi entropy and the subsystem size satisfies the predictions from conformal field theory. In the dynamical case, we find coherent oscillations of the Renyi entropy after the end of the linear quench. These oscillations have universal frequencies which may come from the superpositions of excited states. The asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy implies a new length scale away from the critical point. This length scale is also verified by the overlap of the reduced Renyi entropy against the dimensionless subsystem size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Nielsen geometric method is used to study the position dependence of the Nielsen complexity for the thermofield double state of a harmonic oscillator. We present the state shift under the influence of an external electric field and demonstrate its importance for the construction of the corresponding circuit. By numerical analysis, we investigate the effect of the frequency and the external field on the dynamics of complexity. Our observation reveals that the system's complexity diminishes considerably with the rise of the frequency. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the complexity exhibits a distinct behavior under a feeble external electric field, as it grows more intricate with the escalation of the frequency. However, with higher magnitudes of the electric field, the system reverts to its prior behavior. We also remark on the influence of the reference state's frequency on the complexity.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes more solutions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a flat FLRW minisuperspace. We study quantum cosmology in the framework of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and investigate the quantum cosmological effects throughout the evolution of the universe. In a particular solution, the tendency for a scalar field to roll down the potential is balanced by the quantum force, and a Minkowski spacetime is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quasi-local masses and cosmological coupling of black holes and mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent heated debate on whether the masses of local objects, such as compact stars or black holes (BHs), may be affected by the large-scale, cosmological dynamics, we analyze the conditions under which, in a general relativity framework, such a coupling small/large scales is allowed. We shed light on some controversial arguments, which have been used to rule out the latter possibility. We find that the cosmological coupling occurs whenever the energy of the central objects is quantified by the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass (MS). Conversely, the decoupling occurs whenever the MS mass is fully equivalent to the (nonlocal) Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. Consequently, for singular BHs embedded in cosmological backgrounds, like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter or McVittie solutions, we show that there is no cosmological coupling, confirming previous results in the literature. Furthermore, we show that nonsingular compact objects couple to the cosmological background, as quantified by their MS mass. We conclude that observational evidence of cosmological coupling of astrophysical BHs would be the smoking gun of their nonsingular nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the possibility of gravitationally induced matter creation in the so-called Energy-Momentum-Squared gravity (EMSG), i.e. $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, in its dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation. Given the explicit nonminimal coupling between matter and geometry in this theory, the energy-momentum tensor is not generally covariantly conserved, which motivates the study of cosmological scenarios by resorting to the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems. We start by deriving the universe matter creation rates and subsequent thermodynamical properties, such as, the creation pressure, temperature evolution, and entropy evolution, in the framework of $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. These quantities are then analyzed for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background with a scale factor described by the de Sitter solution, under different assumptions for the mater distribution, namely a vacuum universe, a constant density universe, and a time-varying density universe. Finally, we explore cosmological solutions with varying Hubble parameters and provide a comparison with the standard cosmological model. Our results indicate that the cosmological evolution in the framework of EMSG are in close agreement with the observational cosmological data for low redshift.</description>

Abstract: I demonstrate how chiral fermions with an exact gauge symmetry can appear on the d-dimensional boundary of a finite volume (d+1)-dimensional manifold, without any light mirror partners. The condition for the d-dimensional boundary theory to be local is that gauge anomalies cancel and that the volume be large. This can likely be achieved on a lattice and provides a new paradigm for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of unpaired Weyl fermions appearing on the sole 2n-dimensional boundary of a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold with massive Dirac fermions was recently analyzed in a companion paper by one of the authors. In this Letter we show that similar unpaired Weyl edge states can be seen on a finite lattice. In particular, we consider the discretized Hamiltonian for a Wilson fermion in (2+1) dimensions with a 1+1 dimensional boundary and continuous time. We demonstrate that the low lying boundary spectrum is indeed Weyl-like: it has a linear dispersion relation and definite chirality and circulates in only one direction around the boundary. We comment on how our results are consistent with Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. This work removes one potential obstacle facing the program for regulating chiral gauge theories recently proposed by one of the authors.</description>

Abstract: We herein investigate the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco in de Sitter black holes with electric charge or angular momentum. Our analysis focuses on the cosmological horizon, which only exists in de Sitter and Nariai spacetimes. Because the relation is given in a general case, the overall relationship may be valid. However, we elucidate the details of the relation, highlighting distinctions from those of (anti-)de Sitter black holes while affirming the validity of the relation. Furthermore, based on our analysis of Schwarzschild--de Sitter, Reissner--Nordstr\"om--de Sitter, and Kerr--de Sitter black holes, we demonstrate the universality of the thermodynamic relation in de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <title>Criterion for ultra-fast bubble walls: the impact of hydrodynamic obstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction is usually used to determine whether or not a bubble wall can run away. However, the friction on the wall is not necessarily a monotonous function of the wall velocity and could have a maximum before it reaches the B\"{o}deker-Moore limit. In this paper, we compare the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction, a frictional force that exists in local thermal equilibrium, and the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction. We study the former in a fully analytical way, clarifying its physical origin and providing a simple expression for its corresponding critical phase transition strength above which the driving force cannot be balanced out by the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction. We find that for large parameter space, the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction is larger than the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction, indicating that the conventional criterion for the runaway behavior of the bubble wall may have to be modified. We also explain how to apply efficiently the modified criterion to particle physics models and discuss possible limitations of the analysis carried out in this paper.</description>
