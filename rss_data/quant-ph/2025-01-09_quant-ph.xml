      <title>Frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber: power scaling, background, and bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers allow photons at near-infrared wavelengths to travel with minimal loss. Quantum frequency conversion is a method to alter the wavelength of a single photon while maintaining its quantum state. Most commonly, nonlinear crystals are employed for this conversion process, where near-unity conversion efficiency at high fidelity has been demonstrated. Still, the crystal-based conversion process is plagued by strong background noise, very limited spectral bandwidth, and inhomogeneous temperature profiles at strong pump fields.
  In previous work, we have demonstrated frequency conversion in hydrogen-filled hollow-core fibers and claimed that this conversion process does not compromise performance at strong pump fields, is essentially free of background noise, and intrinsically broadband. Here, we demonstrate that these three claims are justified.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of Bell inequalities for mixed Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase space formalism to evaluate Bell inequality violations in continuous variable systems. By doing so we can generalize previous analyses (which have dealt only with pure states) to arbitrary mixed states. We leverage these results to analyze the effect of temperature on violations of Bell inequalities in a two-mode squeezed thermal state, which can become useful in tests of local realism in the presence of thermal noise. We also explore the non-monotonic relationship between the violations of Bell inequalities and the amount of entanglement present in this family of mixed states. Additionally, we discuss the optimal choices of pseudospin operators for states beyond the two-mode squeezed vacuum.</description>

      <title>Operator Spreading in Random Unitary Circuits with Unitary-invariant Gate Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random unitary circuits have become a model system to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. In the literature, mostly random circuits with Haar-distributed gate operations have been considered. In this work, we investigate operator spreading in random unitary circuits in which the elementary gate operations are drawn from general unitary-invariant ensembles, which include the well-studied Haar-distributed random unitary circuits as a special case. Similar to the Haar-distributed case, the long-time behavior of operator spreading with the more general unitary-invariant gate distribution is governed by drift-diffusion equations characterized by the butterfly velocity $v_{\rm B}$ and a diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}$. Differences with the Haar-random case are (i) that it takes a finite time $\tau_{\rm b}$ until ensemble-averaged Pauli-string weights take a ``binary'' form, in which they depend only on whether Pauli operators inside the support of the Pauli strong are equal to the identity matrix, and (ii) that the operator spreading is characterized by a finite ``domain-wall width'' $n_{\rm DW}$ separating regions with a random-matrix-like Pauli-string distribution. To illustrate these findings, we perform explicit calculations for random unitary circuits distributed according to the Poisson kernel, which interpolates between the trivial and Haar-distributed circuits.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-tolerant quantum sensing for transverse magnetic fields with spin qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.</description>

      <title>Heralded entanglement of on-demand spin-wave solid-state quantum memories for multiplexed quantum network links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward conditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to \SI{500}{\cps}, with a measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead-time of \SI{100}{\micro\second}, leading to an entanglement rate of \SI{22}{\cps} per heralding detector, increased by a factor of 15 thanks to temporal multiplexing. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement as an extremal Kirkwood-Dirac nonreality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between various different forms of nonclassicality and their resource character is of great importance in quantum foundation and quantum information. Here, we discuss a quantitative link between quantum entanglement and the anomalous/nonclassical nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability, in a bipartite setting. We first construct an entanglement monotone for a pure bipartite state based on the nonreality of the KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal bases in which one of them is a product, and optimizations over these bases. It admits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Memories from Stateless Hardware, Random Access Codes, and Simple Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of one-time memories (OTMs) using classical-accessible stateless hardware, building upon the work of Broadbent et al. and Behera et al.. Unlike the aforementioned work, our approach leverages quantum random access codes (QRACs) to encode two classical bits, $b_0$ and $b_1$, into a single qubit state $\mathcal{E}(b_0 b_1)$ where the receiver can retrieve one of the bits with a certain probability of error. To prove soundness, we define a nonconvex optimization problem over POVMs on $\mathbb{C}^2$. This optimization gives an upper bound on the probability of distinguishing bit $b_{1-\alpha}$ given that the probability that the receiver recovers bit $b_\alpha$ is high. Assuming the optimization is sufficiently accurate, we then prove soundness against a polynomial number of classical queries to the hardware.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking TCL4: Assessing the Usability and Reliability of Fourth-Order Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system can be rigorously derived using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach. Although this formalism is exact, practical numerical implementations often require compromises. The time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation offers an exact framework, yet its application typically relies on a perturbative expansion of both the time forward and time backward state propagators. Due to the significant computational effort involved - and the scarcity of analytical solutions for most open quantum systems - the fourth-order perturbative TCL generator (TCL4) has only been benchmarked on a limited range of systems and parameter spaces. Recent advancements, however, have made the computation of TCL4 faster and more accessible. In this paper, we benchmark the TCL4 master equation against numerically exact methods for the biased spin-boson model. We focus on the regime near critical bath coupling where perturbative master equations are expected to become inaccurate. Our findings reveal that the TCL4 approach is most reliable at low temperature and more efficient than the numerical exact methods. This study aims to delineate the conditions under which the TCL4 perturbative master equation enhances the accuracy of the TCL2.</description>

      <title>Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via non-commuting operators and strong coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, non-commuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights on the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for non-commuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Neutral Atoms in Optical Tweezers as Messenger Qubits for Scaling up a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to combine neutral atom and trapped ion qubits in one scalable modular architecture that uses shuttling of individual neutral atoms in optical tweezers to realize atomic interconnects between trapped ion quantum registers. These interconnects are deterministic, and thus may be performed on-demand. The proposed protocol is as follows: a tweezer-trapped neutral atom qubit is brought close to a trapped ion in an ion chain serving as a module of a larger quantum computer, and an entangling gate is performed between the two qubits. Then the neutral atom is quickly moved to another, nearby trapped ion chain in the same modular ion trap and entangled with an ion in that chain, thus entangling the two separate ion chains. The optical dipole potential of the tweezer beam for the neutral atom does not measurably affect the trapped ions, while the RF ion trap does not affect the neutral atom. With realistic tweezer trap parameters, the neutral atom can be moved over millimeter scale distance in a few tens of microseconds, thus enabling a remote entanglement generation rate of over 10^3/s even with very modest assumptions for the atom-ion quantum gate speed, and possibly up to 10^4/s, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art with photonic interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning of Molecular Energies with Hybrid Quantum-Neural Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Burst Error Correction Ability of Quantum Cyclic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum burst error correction codes (QBECCs) are of great importance to deal with the memory effect in quantum channels. As the most important family of QBECCs, quantum cyclic codes (QCCs) play a vital role in the correction of burst errors. In this work, we characterize the burst error correction ability of QCCs constructed from the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and the Hermitian constructions. We determine the burst error correction limit of QCCs and quantum Reed-Solomon codes with algorithms in polynomial-time complexities. As a result, lots of QBECCs saturating the quantum Reiger bound are obtained. We show that quantum Reed-Solomon codes have better burst error correction abilities than the previous results. At last, we give the quantum error-trapping decoder (QETD) of QCCs for decoding burst errors. The decoder runs in linear time and can decode both degenerate and nondegenerate burst errors. What's more, the numerical results show that QETD can decode much more degenerate burst errors than the nondegenerate ones.</description>

      <title>An exceptional surface and its topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems can display exceptional topological defects without Hermitian counterparts, exemplified by exceptional rings in NH two-dimensional systems. However, exceptional topological features associated with higher-dimension topological defects remain unexplored yet. We here investigate the topology for the singularities in an NH three-dimensional system. We find that the three-order singularities in the parameter space form an exceptional surface (ES), on which all the three eigenstates and eigenenergies coalesce. Such an ES corresponds to a two-dimensional extension of a point-like synthetic tensor monopole. We quantify its topology with the Dixmier-Douady invariant, which measures the quantized flux associated with the synthetic tensor field. We further propose an experimentally feasible scheme for engineering such an NH model. Our results pave the way for investigations of exceptional topology associated with topological defects with more than one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have opened new avenues for real-time quantum state tomography (QST). In this work, we demonstrate the deployment of machine learning-based QST onto edge devices, specifically utilizing field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This implementation is realized using the {\it Vitis AI Integrated Development Environment} provided by AMD\textsuperscript \textregistered~Inc. Compared to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based machine learning QST, our FPGA-based one reduces the average inference time by an order of magnitude, from 38 ms to 2.94 ms, but only sacrifices the average fidelity about $1\% $ reduction (from 0.99 to 0.98). The FPGA-based QST offers a highly efficient and precise tool for diagnosing quantum states, marking a significant advancement in the practical applications for quantum information processing and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Spin Goos-H{\"a}nchen Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wave optics, it was proposed that the reflected light wave can have a remarkable shift when the total internal reflection occurs, if a finite-width wave is incident upon a scalar potential barrier. Such a physical effect is well-known as the Goos-H{\"a}nchen (GH) effect, or the GH shift. Later on, the GH effect has been one after another generalized to non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics by adopting the matter waves. In this work, based on Dirac's equation, by considering the notion of "spin" we successfully generalize the GH effect to its spin version -- the spin GH effect. We find that the direction and the magnitude of spin GH shifts for both reflected and transmitted waves depend on the spin direction and the incident angle of the incident wave. This significant physical effect has a potential application to separating Dirac's particles (i.e., the incident waves) with different spin directions. Some discussions related to the interaction between spin and electric field are made in the end.</description>

      <title>Classically Bound and Quantum Quasi-Bound States of an Electron on a Plane Adjacent to a Magnetic Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three-dimensional space an electron moving in the field of a magnetic monopole has no bound states. In this paper we explore the physics when the electron is restricted to a two-dimensional plane adjacent to a magnetic monopole. We find bound states in the classical version of the problem and quasi-bound states in the quantum one, in addition to a continuum of scattering states. We calculate the lifetimes of the quasi-bound states using several complementary approximate methods, which agree well in the cases where the lifetimes are relatively short. The threshold monopole magnetic charge required to realise a single quasi-bound state is approximately $18Q_D$, where $Q_D$ is the magnetic charge of a Dirac monopole. We examine the feasibility of achieving this magnetic charge in currently available monopole analogues: spin ice, artificial spin ice, and magnetic needles.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of entanglement pumping with bosonic logical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is crucial for quantum networks and computation, yet maintaining high-fidelity entangled quantum states is hindered by decoherence and resource-intensive purification methods. Here, we experimentally demonstrate entanglement pumping, utilizing bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) codes as long-coherence-time storage qubits. By repetitively generating entanglement with short-coherence-time qubits and injecting it into QEC-protected logical qubits, our approach effectively preserves entanglement. Through error detection to discard error states and entanglement pumping to mitigate errors within the code space, we extend the lifespan of entangled logical qubits by nearly 50% compared to the case without entanglement pumping. This work highlights the potential of bosonic logical qubits for scalable quantum networks and introduces a novel paradigm for efficient entanglement management.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian noise limits for sustaining entanglement in multiparty quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principal resource in several quantum information processing tasks is entanglement. Building practically useful versions of such tasks, one often needs to consider multipartite systems. And in such scenarios, it is impossible to eliminate the effects of environment while distributing the resources. We show how information back-flow from the environment, as a result of non-Markovianity in the system dynamics, affects the resources in multipartite systems, specifically multiparty entanglement. In particular, we find that entanglement of multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger cat states saturate with time to a non-zero value for a non-Markovian dephasing noise. The multi-qubit W states saturate to a higher value. Such non-zero time-saturated values are washed out if the non-Markovianity in the channel is removed. The multi-qubit W states provide a richer set of features, including a non-zero value for an asymptotic number of qubits and an even-odd dichotomy in entanglement with number of qubits. Moving over to a non-Markovian depolarising channel, we find that both cat and W states exhibit revival of entanglement after collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin states in semiconductors provide exceptionally stable and noise-resistant environments for qubits, positioning them as optimal candidates for reliable quantum computing technologies. The proposal to use nuclear and electronic spins of donor atoms in silicon, introduced by Kane in 1998, sparked a new research field focused on the precise positioning of individual impurity atoms for quantum devices, utilising scanning tunnelling microscopy and ion implantation. This roadmap article reviews the advancements in the 25 years since Kane's proposal, the current challenges, and the future directions in atomic-scale semiconductor device fabrication and measurement. It covers the quest to create a silicon-based quantum computer and expands to include diverse material systems and fabrication techniques, highlighting the potential for a broad range of semiconductor quantum technological applications. Key developments include phosphorus in silicon devices such as single-atom transistors, arrayed few-donor devices, one- and two-qubit gates, three-dimensional architectures, and the development of a toolbox for future quantum integrated circuits. The roadmap also explores new impurity species like arsenic and antimony for enhanced scalability and higher-dimensional spin systems, new chemistry for dopant precursors and lithographic resists, and the potential for germanium-based devices. Emerging methods, such as photon-based lithography and electron beam manipulation, are discussed for their disruptive potential. This roadmap charts the path toward scalable quantum computing and advanced semiconductor quantum technologies, emphasising the critical intersections of experiment, technological development, and theory.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired Machine Learning for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is a major obstacle in current quantum computing, and Machine Learning for Quantum Error Mitigation (ML-QEM) promises to address this challenge, enhancing computational accuracy while reducing the sampling overheads of standard QEM methods. Yet, existing models lack physical interpretability and rely heavily on extensive datasets, hindering their scalability in large-scale quantum circuits. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Neural Noise Accumulation Surrogate (NNAS), a physics-inspired neural network for ML-QEM that incorporates the structural characteristics of quantum noise accumulation within multi-layer circuits, endowing the model with physical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that NNAS outperforms current methods across a spectrum of metrics, including error mitigation capability, quantum resource consumption, and training dataset size. Notably, for deeper circuits where QEM methods typically struggle, NNAS achieves a remarkable reduction of over half in errors. NNAS also demands substantially fewer training data, reducing dataset reliance by at least an order of magnitude, due to its ability to rapidly capture noise accumulation patterns across circuit layers. This work pioneers the integration of quantum process-derived structural characteristics into neural network architectures, broadly enhancing QEM's performance and applicability, and establishes an integrative paradigm that extends to various quantum-inspired neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Photon-magnon Systems: Exploring the Purcell Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to observing the Purcell effect in a photon-magnon coupled (PMC) hybrid system consisting of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film and a hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) arranged in a planar geometry. This hybrid system has been designed and simulated using the commercial electromagnetic full-wave simulator CST Microwave Studio for various values of damping constant (alpha) of the YIG film while keeping the HRR properties constant. Our results reveal that as the magnon damping increases, the anti-crossing behavior between photon and magnon modes in the transmission spectra diminishes, transitioning the coupled modes into the Purcell regime. This transition is attributed to an enhanced spontaneous emission rate of microwave photons when coupled to lossy magnons, driving the PMC system into the Purcell regime. To elucidate this behavior, we developed a comprehensive theoretical framework based on a quantum model, which accurately describes the observed Purcell phenomena and provides estimations of the PMC strength (g/2pi). Notably, by tuning alpha from 1.4 x 10^-5 to 2.8 x 10^-2, we achieved precise control over (g/2pi) ranging from 63 MHz to 127 MHz. This study highlights the Purcell effect's role in enhancing photon decay rates and establishes a clear relationship with PMC strength. Our work offers a comprehensive method for controlling photon resonance dissipation, opening new avenues for exploring the Purcell effect and its applications in on-chip functional devices leveraging magnon-photon interactions for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</description>

      <title>Realizing Lattice Surgery on Two Distance-Three Repetition Codes with Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is needed for quantum computers to be capable of fault-tolerantly executing algorithms using hundreds of logical qubits. Recent experiments have demonstrated subthreshold error rates for state preservation of a single logical qubit. In addition, the realization of universal quantum computation requires the implementation of logical entangling gates. Lattice surgery offers a practical approach for implementing such gates, particularly in planar quantum processor layouts. In this work, we demonstrate lattice surgery between two distance-three repetition-code qubits by splitting a single distance-three surface-code qubit. Using a quantum circuit fault-tolerant to bit-flip errors, we achieve an improvement in the value of the decoded $ZZ$ logical two-qubit observable compared to a similar non-encoded circuit. By preparing the surface-code qubit in initial states parametrized by a varying polar angle, we evaluate the performance of the lattice surgery operation for non-cardinal states on the logical Bloch sphere and employ logical two-qubit tomography to reconstruct the Pauli transfer matrix of the operation. In this way, we demonstrate the functional building blocks needed for lattice surgery operations on larger-distance codes based on superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Meson-polariton and string dynamics via cavity coupling in Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real time meson and string dynamics of one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays in presence of a collective cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. Single domain walls on top of ordered states behave differently from those found in Ising models, featuring strong anisotropy because of the $U(1)$ invariant coupling between light and matter. The non-local nature of the cavity mode is instead affecting meson and string dynamics drastically. Meson hybridizes coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polariton excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy and propagate freely thanks to the non-local interaction between the underlying domain-walls mediated by the cavity mode. We conclude by examining the effect of cavity losses, proposing a state-preparation protocol which actively uses the cavity mode, and presenting a concrete experimental blueprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a surrogate-based method for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits which is designed to operate with few calls to a quantum computer. We employ a computationally inexpensive classical surrogate to approximate the cost function of a variational quantum algorithm. An initial surrogate is fit to data obtained by sparse sampling of the true cost function using noisy quantum computers. The surrogate is iteratively refined by querying the true cost at the surrogate optima, then using radial basis function interpolation with existing and new true cost data. The use of radial basis function interpolation enables surrogate construction without hyperparameters to pre-train. Additionally, using the surrogate as an acquisition function focuses hardware queries in the vicinity of the true optima. For 16-qubit random 3-regular Max-Cut problems solved using the QAOA ansatz, we find that our method outperforms the prior state of the art. Furthermore, we demonstrate successful optimization of QAOA circuits for 127-qubit random Ising models on an IBM quantum processor using measurement counts of the order of $10^4-10^5$. The strong empirical performance of this approach is an important step towards the large-scale practical application of variational quantum algorithms and a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of classical-surrogate-based learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between \SI{0}{\milli\tesla} and \SI{50}{\milli\tesla}. %We further analyze the linewidth narrowing of a hyperfine transition around its ZEFOZ point. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum paradoxes show that the outcomes of different quantum measurements cannot be described by a single measurement-independent reality. Any theoretical description of a quantum measurement implies the selection of a specific measurement context. Here, we investigate generalised quantum measurements, in order to identify the mechanism by which this specific context is selected. We show that external quantum fluctuations, represented by the initial state of the measurement apparatus, play an essential role in the selection of the context. This has the non-trivial consequence that, when considering measurements other than just idealised projection-valued measures, different outcomes of a single measurement setup can represent different measurement contexts. We further show this result underpins recent claims that contextuality can occur in scenarios without measurement incompatibility.</description>

      <title>Exploring nontrivial topology at quantum criticality in a superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of nontrivial topology in quantum critical states has introduced a new paradigm for classifying quantum phase transitions and challenges the conventional belief that topological phases are typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, realizing and characterizing such topologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers remains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed matter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence in topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical states as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between topology and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological prethermal strong zero modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking paradigm for understanding quantum matter. They are characterized by topological boundary states robust against perturbations that respect the protecting symmetry. In a clean system without disorder, these edge modes typically only occur for the ground states of systems with a bulk energy gap and would not survive at finite temperatures due to mobile thermal excitations. Here, we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge modes, which are protected by emergent symmetries and persist even up to infinite temperature, with an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. In particular, through digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of a one-dimensional disorder-free "cluster" Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles at a wide range of temperatures. By monitoring the propagation of thermal excitations, we show that despite the free mobility of these excitations, their interactions with the edge modes are substantially suppressed in the dimerized regime due to an emergent U(1)$\times$U(1) symmetry, resulting in an unusually prolonged lifetime of the topological edge modes even at infinite temperature. In addition, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence in the dimerized and off-resonant regime, despite the system being disorder-free and far from its ground state. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach to experimentally exploring a variety of finite-temperature topological phases and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived robust boundary qubits that survive to infinite temperature in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bi-frequency solitary waves are generically present in fermionic systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system and the Soler model. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available. We conjecture that stable bi-frequency modes serve as storages of the Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Topological Transitions Characterized by Manifold Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often require different topological invariants to measure, and theses definition usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two different topological phases. To address these issues, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance (MD). This definition does not rely on the berry connection but rather on the information of the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian systems, and gapless systems, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research demonstrates for different topological manifolds, the change rate (first-order derivative) or susceptibility (second-order derivative) of MD exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical points. Compared to the strange correlator, which could be used as a diagnosis for short-range entangled states in 1D and 2D, MD is more universal and could be applied to non-Hermitian systems and long-range entangled states. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct wavefunction-localization phenomena arising out of disorder and non-reciprocity, respectively. An integration of both in a single framework will provide a platform to study the interplay between the two. In this connection, we consider the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which has garnered significant attention among the disordered models due to its self-dual properties. Hence, we investigate a non-reciprocal AA model with complex phase modulation and implement it in suitably designed topolectrical circuits featuring an interface, segregating two non-equivalent circuit networks. In the circuit, the voltage profile localizes at the interface due to the NHSE, while the AL limits localization phenomena within the vicinity of the excitation node. This competing phenomenon leads to a controllable, node-dependent localization or even partial delocalization of the output voltage. Our results not only provide a practical platform for experimentally studying and controlling the wave localization phenomenon but also highlight the potential of circuit architectures in designing highly sensitive sensors and information transfer in communication devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keldysh spinors obey Dirac equation, but have the negative of the Dirac action and Hamiltonian. In an example of the U(1) EM coupling, we show that, despite the sign changes, they have a well-defined non-relativistic limit resulting in quantum mechanics with the positive-definite Pauli Hamiltonian. When non-relativistic Dirac and Keldysh fields are brought to interact, we observe curious decoupling of the two fields in mass-like and vector couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Embeddings Projection and Similarity Metrics for Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, representation learning, which embeds complex information extracted from large amounts of data into dense vector spaces, has emerged as a key technique in machine learning. Among other applications, it has been a key building block for large language models and advanced computer vision systems based on contrastive learning. A core component of representation learning systems is the projection head, which maps the original embeddings into different, often compressed spaces, while preserving the similarity relationship between vectors.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired projection head that includes a corresponding quantum-inspired similarity metric. Specifically, we map classical embeddings onto quantum states in Hilbert space and introduce a quantum circuit-based projection head to reduce embedding dimensionality. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we extended the BERT language model by integrating our projection head for embedding compression. We compared the performance of embeddings, which were compressed using our quantum-inspired projection head, with those compressed using a classical projection head on information retrieval tasks using the TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 Deep Learning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our quantum-inspired method achieves competitive performance relative to the classical method while utilizing 32 times fewer parameters. Furthermore, when trained from scratch, it notably excels, particularly on smaller datasets. This work not only highlights the effectiveness of the quantum-inspired approach but also emphasizes the utility of efficient, ad hoc low-entanglement circuit simulations within neural networks as a powerful quantum-inspired technique.</description>

Abstract: We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Superpositions of coherent light states, are vital for quantum technologies. However, restrictions in existing state preparation and characterization schemes, in combination with decoherence effects, prevent their intensity enhancement and implementation in nonlinear optics. Here, by developing a decoherence--free approach, we generate intense femtosecond--duration infrared coherent state superpositions (CSS) with a mean photon number orders of magnitude higher than the existing CSS sources. We utilize them in nonlinear optics to drive the second harmonic generation process in an optical crystal. We experimentally and theoretically show that the non--classical nature of the intense infrared CSS is imprinted in the second-order autocorrelation traces. Additionally, theoretical analysis shows that the quantum features of the infrared CSS are also present in the generated second harmonic. The findings introduce the optical CSS into the realm of nonlinear quantum optics, opening up new paths in quantum information science and quantum light engineering by creating non-classical light states in various spectral regions via non-linear up-conversion processes.</description>

      <title>Tightening continuity bounds for entropies and bounds on quantum capacities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform continuity bounds on entropies are generally expressed in terms of a single distance measure between a pair of probability distributions or quantum states, typically, the total variation distance or trace distance. However, if an additional distance measure between the probability distributions or states is known, then the continuity bounds can be significantly strengthened. Here, we prove a tight uniform continuity bound for the Shannon entropy in terms of both the local- and total variation distances, sharpening an inequality proven in [I. Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 59, 7118 (2013)]. We also obtain a uniform continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in terms of both the operator norm- and trace distances. The bound is tight when the quotient of the trace distance by the operator norm distance is an integer. We then apply our results to compute upper bounds on the quantum- and private classical capacities of channels. We begin by refining the concept of approximate degradable channels, namely, $\varepsilon$-degradable channels, which are, by definition, $\varepsilon$-close in diamond norm to their complementary channel when composed with a degrading channel. To this end, we introduce the notion of $(\varepsilon,\nu)$-degradable channels; these are $\varepsilon$-degradable channels that are, in addition, $\nu$-close in completely bounded spectral norm to their complementary channel, when composed with the same degrading channel. This allows us to derive improved upper bounds to the quantum- and private classical capacities of such channels. Moreover, these bounds can be further improved by considering certain unstabilized versions of the above norms. We show that upper bounds on the latter can be efficiently expressed as semidefinite programs. We illustrate our results by obtaining a new upper bound on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>Lower bound of the expressibility of ansatzes for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expressibility of an ansatz used in a variational quantum algorithm is defined as the uniformity with which it can explore the space of unitary matrices, i.e., its covering number. The expressibility of a particular ansatz has a well-defined upper bound [1]. In this work, we show that the expressibility also has a well-defined lower bound in the hypothesis space. We provide an analytical expression for the lower bound of the covering number, which is directly related to expressibility. Further, we provide numerical analysis to support our claim. By calculating the bond length of hydrogen molecule ($H_2$) using different ansatzes in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) setting, we study the variation of equilibrium energy error with circuit depths. We show that in each ansatz template, a plateau exists for a range of circuit depths, which we call the set of acceptable points, and the corresponding expressibility as the best expressive region. We report that the width of this best expressive region in the hypothesis space is inversely proportional to the average error.

      <title>Heisenberg-Limited Quantum Lidar for Joint Range and Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum lidar protocol to jointly estimate the range and velocity of a target by illuminating it with a single beam of pulsed displaced squeezed light. In the lossless scenario, we show that the mean-squared errors of both range and velocity estimations are inversely proportional to the squared number of signal photons, simultaneously attaining the Heisenberg limit. This is achieved by engineering the multi-photon squeezed state of the temporal modes and adopting standard homodyne detection. To assess the robustness of the quantum protocol, we incorporate photon losses and detuning of the homodyne receiver. Our findings reveal a quantum advantage over the best-known classical strategy across a wide range of round-trip transmissivities. Particularly, the quantum advantage is substantial for sufficiently small losses, even when compared to the optimal -- potentially unattainable -- classical performance limit. The quantum advantage also extends to the practical case where quantum engineering is done on top of a strong classical coherent state with watts of power. This, together with the robustness against losses and the feasibility of the measurement with state-of-the-art technology, make the protocol highly promising for near-term implementation.</description>

      <title>Covering a Graph with Minimal Local Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of the energy density of a spontaneously emitted single-photon from a Hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze through the expectation value of the energy density the spatial nonlocality of single photons emitted by the spontaneous decay of a Hydrogen atom. By using a minimal coupling between the quantized electromagnetic field and the atom, we compute the state of the photon under the assumption that only a single-photon is produced. The calculations are thus performed in the subspace of single-photon states which is essentially equivalent to the rotating wave approximation. We obtain a characterization of the spatial decay of the energy density. We compute the asymptotic limit of large distances from the atom at each given time, and find an algebraic behavior of $1/r^6$. This result confirms that the energy density of single-photon states is nonlocal and the algebraic decay is far from the maximal quasiexponential localization predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of versatile and effective quantum metrology using a single bosonic mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology offers the potential to surpass its classical counterpart, pushing the boundaries of measurement precision toward the ultimate Heisenberg limit. This enhanced precision is normally attained by utilizing large squeezed states or multi-particle entangled quantum states, both of which are often challenging to implement and prone to decoherence in real quantum devices. In this work, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that leverages two efficient state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB. Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights, based on specific system constraints. The realization of this versatile and efficient scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states are crucial for the fundamental understanding of non-linear bosonic systems and simultaneously advanced applications in quantum technologies. In many bosonic experiments the important quantum non-Gaussian feature is the negativity of the Wigner function, a cornerstone for quantum computation with bosons. Unfortunately, the negativities present in complex quantum states are extremely vulnerable to the effects of decoherence, such as energy loss, noise and dephasing, caused by the coupling to the environment, which is an unavoidable part of any experimental implementation. An efficient way to mitigate its effects is by adapting quantum states into more resilient forms. We propose an optimal protection of superpositions of coherent states against a sequence of asymmetric thermal lossy channels by suitable squeezing operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revisiting the issue associated with Position-Dependent Mass (PDM), we reaffirm that the appropriate framework for addressing a generic PDM is the symmetrization proposed by BenDaniel and Duke. To accomplish this result adopts the effective mass Hamiltonian proposed by von Roos, corrected by a symmetrized kinematic term. After verifying the appropriate ordering to approach the PDM issue, one investigates a crystalline lattice with a defect described by a singular PDM. The singular mass profile proves intriguing as it yields an atom's cluster in the neighborhood of the singularity. Considering that a restoring force acts on the atoms, one notes that the confluent Heun function describes the quantum states. Furthermore, one highlights that when the effective mass distribution tends to a constant profile, we recover a system similar to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Photonic "hourglass" design beyond the standard bulk model of phonon decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of mechanical vibrations on the performance of the photonic "hourglass" structure, which is predicted to emit single photons on-demand with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability. Previous investigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this quasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for the phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much stronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we surprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design, achieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed description of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in terms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source, which eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key role of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon decoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Hamiltonian variational ansatz for combinatorial optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining exact solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using classical computing is computationally expensive. The current tenet in the field is that quantum computers can address these problems more efficiently. While promising algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum hardware, variational algorithms have emerged as viable candidates for near-term devices. The success of these algorithms hinges on multiple factors, with the design of the ansatz having the utmost importance. It is known that popular approaches such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing suffer from adiabatic bottlenecks, that lead to either larger circuit depth or evolution time. On the other hand, the evolution time of imaginary time evolution is bounded by the inverse energy gap of the Hamiltonian, which is constant for most non-critical physical systems. In this work, we propose imaginary Hamiltonian variational ansatz ($i$HVA) inspired by quantum imaginary time evolution to solve the MaxCut problem. We introduce a tree arrangement of the parametrized quantum gates, enabling the exact solution of arbitrary tree graphs using the one-round $i$HVA. For randomly generated $D$-regular graphs, we numerically demonstrate that the $i$HVA solves the MaxCut problem with a small constant number of rounds and sublinear depth, outperforming QAOA, which requires rounds increasing with the graph size. Furthermore, our ansatz solves MaxCut exactly for graphs with up to 24 nodes and $D \leq 5$, whereas only approximate solutions can be derived by the classical near-optimal Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We validate our simulated results with hardware demonstrations on a graph with 67 nodes.</description>

      <title>Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the minimum entropy production in near-reversible quantum state transport along a path is simple function of the path length measured according to the Fisher-KMB metrics. Hence the sharp values of path lengths, also called statistical lengths, obtain operational meaning to quantify the residual irreversibility in near-reversible state transport. In the classical limit, the Bhattacharyya fidelity obtains a sharp operational meaning after eighty years.</description>

      <title>Adding Photonic Entanglement to Superradiance by Using Multilevel Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show here that the photonic states emitted by ensembles of multilevel atoms via a superradiance process exhibit entanglement in the modal (frequency) degree of freedom, making this collective emission process a favorable candidate for a fast, bright and deterministic source of entangled photons. This entanglement is driven by two mechanisms: (i) selective excitation of the atomic ensemble to a superposition state and (ii) degeneracies of the optical transitions due to internal structure of the emitting atoms. The latter induces intricate non-radiative virtual transitions in the ensemble, which create interatomic correlations that are imprinted onto the emitted photons. One of the important outcomes of this complexity is the generation of mode-independent entangled multiphoton states. In addition, we study the dynamics of the correlations of the superradiating multilevel atom ensembles, and demonstrate a case where they exhibit beating in steady-state due to the aforementioned virtual transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>

Abstract: The exclusivity principle (E-principle) states that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. Unlike other principles proposed to characterize quantum correlations, its intrinsically non-bipartite formulation enables its application in more general contextuality scenarios. Although equivalent to the no-signalling condition for any bipartite Bell scenario, this equivalence breaks down for two independent copies of the same scenario. Such violation of the E-principle due to multiple copies, known as its activation effect, was studied in [Nat Commun 4, 2263 (2013)] for the nonlocal extremal boxes of $(2,m,2)$, $(2,2,d)$, and $(3,2,2)$ Bell scenarios. The authors mapped the problem of exhibiting activation effects to finding certain cliques inside joint exclusivity graphs. In this work, we refine the joint exclusivity structure to be an edge-colored exclusivity multigraph. This allows us to draw a novel connection to Ramsey theory, which guarantees the existence of certain monochromatic subgraphs in sufficiently large edge-colored cliques, providing a powerful tool for ruling out E-principle violations. We then exploit this connection, drawing on Ramsey-theoretic results to study violations of the E-principle by multiple copies of the contextual extremal boxes of $n$-cycle scenarios, called $n$-cycle PR boxes. For the usual ($n=4$) PR box we show that the known E-principle violation of $5/4$ is the maximal achievable using two copies, and that this same upper bound applies to two copies of the KCBS ($n = 5$) PR box. We then prove that $n \geq 6$-cycle PR boxes, unlike the extremal boxes of the aforementioned Bell scenarios, do not exhibit activation effects with two or three copies. Finally, for any number of independent copies $k$, we establish a lower bound on $n$ above which $n$-cycle PR boxes do not exhibit activation effects with $k$ copies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum scientific computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve difficult scientific computing problems on quantum computers. One of them is topology optimization, which is computationally expensive because the combinatorial optimization problem and partial differential equations need to be solved simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel variational quantum algorithm for topology optimization through quantum entanglement. Two quantum registers are used to encode the optimal configurations and the solutions to physical constraints, respectively. The tasks of finding the optimal material configuration and solving the physical constraints are performed simultaneously in a single loop. A constraint encoding scheme is also proposed to incorporate volume and topology constraints in optimization. The gate complexity of the proposed quantum algorithm is analyzed. The theoretical lower bound of the success probability is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated with compliance minimization problems including truss structures and Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm beams.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Without Encoding via the Circulant Structure of Pauli Noise and the Fast Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for correcting the output distribution of a quantum computer that does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more physical qubits. Thus, it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error correction codes. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel (we can bias the noise with twirling), the ideal output distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a circulant block structure. Thus, the ideal distribution can be retrieved from the noisy output distribution by applying the Fast Fourier Transform. Moreover, due to its circulant structure, characterization of this matrix can be achieved by sampling a single circuit. The results are corroborated with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits. The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output distributions. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.</description>

      <title>Bit-bit encoding, optimizer-free training and sub-net initialization: techniques for scalable quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning for classical data is currently perceived to have a scalability problem due to (i) a bottleneck at the point of loading data into quantum states, (ii) the lack of clarity around good optimization strategies, and (iii) barren plateaus that occur when the model parameters are randomly initialized. In this work, we propose techniques to address all of these issues. First, we present a quantum classifier that encodes both the input and the output as binary strings which results in a model that has no restrictions on expressivity over the encoded data but requires fast classical compression of typical high-dimensional datasets to only the most predictive degrees of freedom. Second, we show that if one parameter is updated at a time, quantum models can be trained without using a classical optimizer in a way that guarantees convergence to a local minimum, something not possible for classical deep learning models. Third, we propose a parameter initialization strategy called sub-net initialization to avoid barren plateaus where smaller models, trained on more compactly encoded data with fewer qubits, are used to initialize models that utilize more qubits. Along with theoretical arguments on efficacy, we demonstrate the combined performance of these methods on subsets of the MNIST dataset for models with an all-to-all connected architecture that use up to 16 qubits in simulation. This allows us to conclude that the loss function consistently decreases as the capability of the model, measured by the number of parameters and qubits, increases, and this behavior is maintained for datasets of varying complexity. Together, these techniques offer a coherent framework for scalable quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Photon Transport in a Gas of Two-Level Atoms: Unveiling Quantum Light Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of nearly monochromatic light propagation through a gas of two-level atoms using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation method. Our focus is on the evolution of the photon annihilation operator and its impact on the second-order correlation function, $g^{(2)}({\tau})$, with particular emphasis on photon antibunching behavior. The model accounts for both open and closed atomic system approximations, including Doppler broadening and the influence of pump field detuning. We derive expressions that reproduce known results from scattering theory and extend the analysis to complex systems, such as inhomogeneously broadened media. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data from a waveguide QED platform, which show good agreement and thereby demonstrate the power of our approach. Future work will explore extensions to even more complex systems and other quantum light characteristics for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and a robust toolbox for quantum state manipulation using universal gates. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a common phase reference - even though global phases are unmeasurable in quantum optics. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. In the introduced framework, general pure states are described using two orthogonal modes in the Fock basis. We show that this approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. Moreover, the superselection rule-compliant representation provides a consistent definition of non-purity and coherence for optical modes and states. It offers a clearer and general perspective on quantum universality, non-classicality, and the (im)possibility of efficient classical simulation across various quantum information encoding schemes involving quantum optical modes and states.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced superconductivity via band engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moir\'e system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the sensitivity of an atom interferometer with a phase-modulation readout scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of an interferometer depends on its readout scheme. However, little attention has been paid to the readout schemes of atom interferometers from the viewpoint of their sensitivity. The difference in sensitivity between readout schemes or their optimization has not been considered in the literature. Herein we analytically calculate the sensitivities of an atom interferometer with typical readout schemes by applying the two-photon formalism, which was developed for optical interferometers to deal with quantum noise. Our calculations reveal that by using sinusoidal phase modulation, the sensitivity can surpass that obtained by the conventional phase sweeping scheme. The superiority of this phase modulation scheme for both cold and thermal atomic beams is demonstrated. In addition, we show that the phase modulation scheme is advantageous for atom-flux fluctuation and resists atom-flux drift. This study performs a general analysis of the sensitivity of atom interferometers and identifies an advantageous readout scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, the universal homogeneous spin simularor (UHSS) using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry based on the one introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024), arXiv:2306.0574(3) ]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size. This approach works because it allows arbitrary long-range interactions in the spin model to be mapped on an optical system with only nearest-neighbor physical interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum droplet which is confined in a ring potential. We investigate the so-called "yrast" state, i.e., the lowest-energy state of the droplet assuming that it has some fixed expectation value of the angular momentum. Two are the most interesting aspects of this problem, the nonlinear term -- which is partly attractive and partly repulsive -- and the periodic boundary conditions. For some range of the parameters, the attractive, or the repulsive part of the nonlinear term dominates and one gets the expected behavior. In some intermediate regime the two nonlinear terms are of comparable size. In this case both the solution, as well as the corresponding dispersion relation show an interesting behavior. Finally, we make contact with the problem of solitary-wave excitation, since the derived solutions are travelling-wave, i.e., solitary-wave, solutions.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Relative Entropy</title>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ using exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. For all $1&lt;\alpha\leq 3$ the quantum phase transition from a superfluid and a Mott insulator at unit filling is found to be continuous and scale invariant, in a way incompatible with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario, which is recovered for $\alpha&gt;3$. We characterise the new universality class by providing the critical exponents by means of data collapse analysis near the critical point for each $\alpha$ and from careful analysis of the spectrum. Large-scale simulations of the grand canonical phase diagram and of the decay of correlation functions demonstrate an overall behavior akin to higher dimensional systems with long-range order in the ground state for $\alpha \leq 2$ and intermediate between one and higher dimensions for $2&lt;\alpha \leq 3$. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark to compare theories of long-range quantum models and are relevant for experiments with cold neutral atom, molecules and ion chains.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir\'e materials.</description>
