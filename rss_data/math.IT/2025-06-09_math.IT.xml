      <title>Channel Estimation with Asynchronous Reception for User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The user-centric, cell-free wireless network is a promising next-generation communication system, but signal synchronization issues arise due to distributed access points and lack of cellular structure. We propose a novel method to recover synchronous pilot reception by introducing new pilot sequences and a matched filter window, enabling orthogonality even with asynchronous reception. Our approach mimics synchronous transmission by extending training sequences. Analysis shows asynchronous reception's impact on channel estimation, and our method significantly improves performance with a small increase of training time overhead. Results demonstrate a 7.26 dB reduction in normalized mean square error and 40% increase in data rate, achieving performance levels comparable to the synchronous case.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna System-Assisted Self-Interference Cancellation for In-Band Full Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems are expected to double the spectral efficiency compared to half-duplex systems, provided that loopback self-interference (SI) can be effectively suppressed. The inherent interference mitigation capabilities of the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology make it a promising candidate for addressing the SI challenge in IBFD systems. This paper thus proposes a FAS-assisted self-interference cancellation (SIC) framework, which leverages a receiver-side FAS to dynamically select an interference-free port. Analytical results include a lower bound and an approximation of the residual SI (RSI) power, both derived for rich-scattering channels by considering the joint spatial correlation amongst the FAS ports. Simulations of RSI power and forward link rates validate the analysis, showing that the SIC performance improves with the number of FAS ports. Additionally, simulations under practical conditions, such as finite-scattering environments and wideband integrated access and backhaul (IAB) channels, reveal that the proposed approach offers superior SIC capability and significant forward rate gains over conventional IBFD SIC schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint User Association and Beamforming Design for ISAC Networks with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a more important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC networks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and sensing (C\&amp;S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas simultaneously provide C\&amp;S services for multiple ground communication users (CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\&amp;S, we formulate a joint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation requirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and inference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based optimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt engineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA optimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to handle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast convergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model, outperforming various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Differential Spectrum and Boomerang Spectrum of Some Power Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^{s(p^m-1)}$ be a power mapping over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $n=2m$ and $\gcd(s,p^m+1)=t$. In \cite{kpm-1}, Hu et al. determined the differential spectrum and boomerang spectrum of the power function $f$, where $t=1$. So what happens if $t\geq1$? In this paper, we extend the result of \cite{kpm-1} from $t=1$ to general case. We use a different method than in \cite{kpm-1} to determine the differential spectrum and boomerang spectrum of $f$ by studying the number of rational points on some curves. This method may be helpful for calculating the differential spectrum and boomerang spectrum of some Niho type power functions.</description>

      <title>Capacity of MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless systems, known as gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), are expected to enhance performance by significantly increasing the number of antennas, e.g., a few thousands. To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming the scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave network that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain, thereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO architectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate achievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing MiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate maximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which are assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless and reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the microwave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also characterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided beamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, reveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital beamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) resolution requirements, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On Inverse Problems, Parameter Estimation, and Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems: State-of-the-Art, Key Techniques and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas have emerged as a promising technology for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, particularly in high-frequency communication systems operating in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By enabling dynamic activation at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, pinching antennas offer unprecedented channel reconfigurability and the ability to provide line-of-sight (LoS) links in scenarios with severe LoS blockages. The performance of pinching-antenna systems is highly dependent on the optimized placement of the pinching antennas, which must be jointly considered with traditional resource allocation (RA) variables -- including transmission power, time slots, and subcarriers. The resulting joint RA problems are typically non-convex with complex variable coupling, necessitating sophisticated optimization techniques. This article provides a comprehensive survey of existing RA algorithms designed for pinching-antenna systems, supported by numerical case studies that demonstrate their potential performance gains. Key challenges and open research problems are also identified to guide future developments in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common filters are usually based on the linear approximation of the optimal minimum mean square error estimator. The Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters handle nonlinearity through linearization and unscented transformation, respectively, but remain linear estimators, meaning that the state estimate is a linear function of the measurement. This paper proposes a quadratic approximation of the optimal estimator, creating the Quadratic Extended and Quadratic Unscented Kalman Filter. These retain the structure of their linear counterpart, but include information from the measurement square to obtain a more accurate estimate. Numerical results show the benefits in accuracy of the new technique, which can be generalized to upgrade other linear estimators to their quadratic versions.</description>

      <title>A New Representation of Binary Sequences by means of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean functions and binary sequences are main tools used in cryptography. In this work, we introduce a new bijection between the set of Boolean functions and the set of binary sequences with period a power of two. We establish a connection between them which allows us to study some properties of Boolean functions through binary sequences and vice versa. Then, we define a new representation of sequences, based on Boolean functions and derived from the algebraic normal form, named reverse-ANF. Next, we study the relation between such a representation and other representations of Boolean functions as well as between such a representation and the binary sequences. Finally, we analyse the generalized self-shrinking sequences in terms of Boolean functions and some of their properties using the different representations.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Secure Transmissions in IRS-Assisted NOMA Communications: CO-GNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS, lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Talk 'Sex'? Exploring How AI Models Handle Intimate Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how four prominent large language models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Deepseek-V3) handle sexually oriented requests through qualitative content analysis. By evaluating responses to prompts ranging from explicitly sexual to educational and neutral control scenarios, the research reveals distinct moderation paradigms reflecting fundamentally divergent ethical positions. Claude 3.7 Sonnet employs strict and consistent prohibitions, while GPT-4o navigates user interactions through nuanced contextual redirection. Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits permissiveness with threshold-based limits, and Deepseek-V3 demonstrates troublingly inconsistent boundary enforcement and performative refusals. These varied approaches create a significant "ethical implementation gap," stressing a critical absence of unified ethical frameworks and standards across platforms. The findings underscore the urgent necessity for transparent, standardized guidelines and coordinated international governance to ensure consistent moderation, protect user welfare, and maintain trust as AI systems increasingly mediate intimate aspects of human life.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning. Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines, particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.</description>

      <title>RSMA-Enabled Covert Communications Against Multiple Spatially Random Wardens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates covert communication in a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based multi-user multiple-input single-output system, where the random locations of the wardens follow a homogeneous Poisson point process. To demonstrate practical deployment scenarios, imperfect channel state information at the transmitter is considered. Closed-form expressions for the statistics of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, along with the analytical formulations for the covertness constraint, outage probability, and effective covert throughput (ECT), are derived. Subsequently, an ECT maximization problem is formulated under covertness and power allocation constraints. This optimization problem is addressed using an alternating optimization-assisted genetic algorithm (AO-GA). Simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of RSMA over conventional multiple access schemes, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed AO-GA.</description>

      <title>Dual Approach to Inverse Covariance Intersection Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated. Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown "common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and from the perspective of families of upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Compression of executable QR codes or sQRy for Industry: an example for Wi-Fi access points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.</description>

      <title>Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly. Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$, where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Rauzy dimension and finite-state dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1976, Rauzy studied two complexity functions, $\underline{\beta}$ and $\overline{\beta}$, for infinite sequences over a finite alphabet. The function $\underline{\beta}$ achieves its maximum precisely for Borel normal sequences, while $\overline{\beta}$ reaches its minimum for sequences that, when added to any Borel normal sequence, result in another Borel normal sequence. We establish a connection between Rauzy's complexity functions, $\underline{\beta}$ and $\overline{\beta}$, and the notions of non-aligned block entropy, $\underline{h}$ and $\overline{h}$, by providing sharp upper and lower bounds for $\underline{h}$ in terms of $\underline{\beta}$, and sharp upper and lower bounds for $\overline{h}$ in terms of $\overline{\beta}$. We adopt a probabilistic approach by considering an infinite sequence of random variables over a finite alphabet. The proof relies on a new characterization of non-aligned block entropies, $\overline{h}$ and $\underline{h}$, in terms of Shannon's conditional entropy. The bounds imply that sequences with $\overline{h} = 0$ coincide with those for which $\overline{\beta} = 0$. We also show that the non-aligned block entropies, $\underline{h}$ and $\overline{h}$, are essentially subadditive.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Stability of Normalized Mutual Information Estimator on High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information provides a powerful, general-purpose metric for quantifying the amount of shared information between variables. Estimating normalized mutual information using a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) based approach involves the calculation of the scaling-invariant k-NN radius. Calculation of the radius suffers from numerical overflow when the joint dimensionality of the data becomes high, typically in the range of several hundred dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a logarithmic transformation technique that improves the numerical stability of the radius calculation in high-dimensional spaces. By applying the proposed transformation during the calculation of the radius, numerical overflow is avoided, and precision is maintained. Proposed transformation is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, demonstrating its ability to stabilize the calculation without compromising precision, increasing bias, or adding significant computational overhead, while also helping to maintain estimator variance.</description>

      <title>ByzSecAgg: A Byzantine-Resistant Secure Aggregation Scheme for Federated Learning Based on Coded Computing and Vector Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose ByzSecAgg, an efficient secure aggregation scheme for federated learning that is resistant to Byzantine attacks and privacy leakages. Processing individual updates to manage adversarial behavior, while preserving the privacy of the data against colluding nodes, requires some sort of secure secret sharing. However, the communication load for secret sharing of long vectors of updates can be very high. In federated settings, where users are often edge devices with potential bandwidth constraints, excessive communication overhead is undesirable. ByzSecAgg solves this problem by partitioning local updates into smaller sub-vectors and sharing them using ramp secret sharing. However, this sharing method does not admit bilinear computations, such as pairwise distances calculations, which are needed for distance-based outlier-detection algorithms, and effective methods for mitigating Byzantine attacks. To overcome this issue, each user runs another round of ramp sharing, with a different embedding of the data in the sharing polynomial. This technique, motivated by ideas from coded computing, enables secure computation of pairwise distance. In addition, to maintain the integrity and privacy of the local update, ByzSecAgg also uses a vector commitment method, in which the commitment size remains constant (i.e., does not increase with the length of the local update), while simultaneously allowing verification of the secret sharing process. In terms of communication load, ByzSecAgg significantly outperforms the related baseline scheme, known as BREA.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>A new pathway to generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence revolutionized society. Current models are trained by minimizing the distance between the produced data and the training set. Consequently, development is plateauing as they are intrinsically data-hungry and challenging to direct during the generative process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a paradigm shift through a framework where we do not fit the training set but find the most informative yet least noisy representation of the data simultaneously minimizing the entropy to reduce noise and maximizing it to remain unbiased via adversary training. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our approach outperforms variational autoencoders. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without any fine-tuning or retraining</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology -- implementable in linear time -- carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of Quantum Polar Codes and Quantum Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good quantum error-correcting codes that fulfill practical considerations, such as simple encoding circuits and efficient decoders, are essential for functional quantum information processing systems. Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</description>
