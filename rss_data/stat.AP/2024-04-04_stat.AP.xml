      <title>Auditing the Use of Language Models to Guide Hiring Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory efforts to protect against algorithmic bias have taken on increased urgency with rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), which are machine learning models that can achieve performance rivaling human experts on a wide array of tasks. A key theme of these initiatives is algorithmic "auditing," but current regulations -- as well as the scientific literature -- provide little guidance on how to conduct these assessments. Here we propose and investigate one approach for auditing algorithms: correspondence experiments, a widely applied tool for detecting bias in human judgements. In the employment context, correspondence experiments aim to measure the extent to which race and gender impact decisions by experimentally manipulating elements of submitted application materials that suggest an applicant's demographic traits, such as their listed name. We apply this method to audit candidate assessments produced by several state-of-the-art LLMs, using a novel corpus of applications to K-12 teaching positions in a large public school district. We find evidence of moderate race and gender disparities, a pattern largely robust to varying the types of application material input to the models, as well as the framing of the task to the LLMs. We conclude by discussing some important limitations of correspondence experiments for auditing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous clustering and estimation of additive shape invariant models for recurrent event data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advancements have enabled the recording of spiking activities from large neuron ensembles, presenting an exciting yet challenging opportunity for statistical analysis. This project considers the challenges from a common type of neuroscience experiments, where randomized interventions are applied over the course of each trial. The objective is to identify groups of neurons with unique stimulation responses and estimate these responses. The observed data, however, comprise superpositions of neural responses to all stimuli, which is further complicated by varying response latencies across neurons. We introduce a novel additive shape invariant model that is capable of simultaneously accommodating multiple clusters, additive components, and unknown time-shifts. We establish conditions for the identifiability of model parameters, offering guidance for the design of future experiments. We examine the properties of the proposed algorithm through simulation studies, and apply the proposed method on neural data collected in mice.</description>

      <title>General Effect Modelling (GEM) -- Part 2. Multivariate GEM applied to gene expression data of type 2 diabetes detects information that is lost by univariate validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Effect Modelling (GEM) is an umbrella over different methods that utilise effects in the analyses of data with multiple design variables and multivariate responses. To demonstrate the methodology, we here use GEM in gene expression data where we use GEM to combine data from different cohorts and apply multivariate analysis of the effects of the targeted disease across the cohorts. Omics data are by nature multivariate, yet univariate analysis is the dominating approach used for such data. A major challenge in omics data is that the number of features such as genes, proteins and metabolites are often very large, whereas the number of samples is limited. Furthermore, omics research aims to obtain results that are generically valid across different backgrounds. The present publication applies GEM to address these aspects. First, we emphasise the benefit of multivariate analysis for multivariate data. Then we illustrate the use of GEM to combine data from two different cohorts for multivariate analysis across the cohorts, and we highlight that multivariate analysis can detect information that is lost by univariate validation.</description>

      <title>General Effect Modelling (GEM) -- Part 3. GEM applied on proteome data of cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The novel data analytical platform General Effect Modelling (GEM), is an umbrella platform covering different data analytical methods that handle data with multiple design variables (or pseudo design variables) and multivariate responses. GEM is here demonstrated in an analysis of proteome data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from two independent previously published datasets, one data set comprised of persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, persons with other neurological disorders and persons without neurological disorders, and one data set had persons with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which is the first clinical symptom of MS, and controls. The primary aim of the present publication is to use these data to demonstrate how patient stratification can be utilised by GEM for multivariate analysis. We also emphasize how the findings shed light on important aspects of the molecular mechanism of MS that may otherwise be lost. We identified proteins involved in neural development as significantly lower for MS/CIS than for their respective controls. This information was only seen after stratification of the persons into two groups, which were found to have different inflammatory patterns and the utilisation of this by GEM. Our conclusion from the study of these data is that disrupted neural development may be an early event in CIS and MS.</description>

      <title>Robust inference for linear regression models with possibly skewed error distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for linear regression generally assume that the underlying error distribution, equivalently the distribution of the responses, is normal. Yet, sometimes real life response data may exhibit a skewed pattern, and assuming normality would not give reliable results in such cases. This is often observed in cases of some biomedical, behavioral, socio-economic and other variables. In this paper, we propose to use the class of skew normal (SN) distributions, which also includes the ordinary normal distribution as its special case, as the model for the errors in a linear regression setup and perform subsequent statistical inference using the popular and robust minimum density power divergence approach to get stable insights in the presence of possible data contamination (e.g., outliers). We provide the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator of the regression parameters and also propose robust Wald-type tests of significance for these parameters. We provide an influence function analysis of these estimators and test statistics, and also provide level and power influence functions. Numerical verification including simulation studies and real data analysis is provided to substantiate the theory developed.</description>

      <title>Random Forest for Dynamic Risk Prediction or Recurrent Events: A Pseudo-Observation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent events are common in clinical, healthcare, social and behavioral studies. A recent analysis framework for potentially censored recurrent event data is to construct a censored longitudinal data set consisting of times to the first recurrent event in multiple prespecified follow-up windows of length $\tau$. With the staggering number of potential predictors being generated from genetic, -omic, and electronic health records sources, machine learning approaches such as the random forest are growing in popularity, as they can incorporate information from highly correlated predictors with non-standard relationships. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a random forest approach for dynamically predicting probabilities of remaining event-free during a subsequent $\tau$-duration follow-up period from a reconstructed censored longitudinal data set. We demonstrate the increased ability of our random forest algorithm for predicting the probability of remaining event-free over a $\tau$-duration follow-up period when compared to the recurrent event modeling framework of Xia et al. (2020) in settings where association between predictors and recurrent event outcomes is complex in nature. The proposed random forest algorithm is demonstrated using recurrent exacerbation data from the Azithromycin for the Prevention of Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Albert et al., 2011).</description>

      <title>Learning from limited temporal data: Dynamically sparse historical functional linear models with applications to Earth science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists and statisticians often want to learn about the complex relationships that connect two time-varying variables. Recent work on sparse functional historical linear models confirms that they are promising for this purpose, but several notable limitations exist. Most importantly, previous works have imposed sparsity on the historical coefficient function, but have not allowed the sparsity, hence lag, to vary with time. We simplify the framework of sparse functional historical linear models by using a rectangular coefficient structure along with Whittaker smoothing, then reduce the assumptions of the previous frameworks by estimating the dynamic time lag from a hierarchical coefficient structure. We motivate our study by aiming to extract the physical rainfall-runoff processes hidden within hydrological data. We show the promise and accuracy of our method using eight simulation studies, further justified by two real sets of hydrological data.</description>

      <title>covXtreme : MATLAB software for non-stationary penalised piecewise constant marginal and conditional extreme value models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covXtreme software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest. The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed in MATLAB for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold. The software and case study data can be downloaded from GitHub, with an accompanying user guide.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of the Multinomial Processing Tree-IRT model for the Philadelphia Naming Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Naming tests represent an essential tool in gauging the severity of aphasia and monitoring the trajectory of recovery for individuals afflicted with this debilitating condition. In these assessments, patients are presented with images corresponding to common nouns, and their responses are evaluated for accuracy. The Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) stands as a paragon in this domain, offering nuanced insights into the type of errors made in responses. In a groundbreaking advancement, Walker et al. (2018) introduced a model rooted in Item Response Theory and multinomial processing trees (MPT-IRT). This innovative approach seeks to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying the various errors patients make when responding to an item, aiming to pinpoint the specific stage of word production where a patient's capability falters. However, given the sophisticated nature of the IRT-MPT model proposed by Walker et al. (2018), it is imperative to scrutinize both its conceptual as well as its statistical validity. Our endeavor here is to closely examine the model's formulation to ensure its parameters are identifiable as a first step in evaluating its validity.</description>
