      <title>Scaling behaviour of rotating convection in a spherical shell with different Prandtl numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-Benard convection in a rotating spherical shell provides a simplified model for convective dynamics of planetary and stellar interiors. In this study, we build more than 200 numerical models of rotating convection in a spherical shell over a wide range of $\Pran$ ($10^{-2}\le\Pran\le10^2$). As increasing the Rayleigh number $Ra$, we characterise four different flow regimes, starting from the linear onset to multiple modes, then transiting to the geostrophic turbulence and eventually approaching the weakly rotating regime. In the multiple modes regime, we show evidence of triadic resonances in numerical models with different $\Pran$, which may provide a generic mechanism for the transition from laminar to turbulence in rotating convection. We analyse scaling behaviours of the heat transfer and convective flow speeds in numerical simulations, paying particular attention to the $\Pran$-dependence. We find that the so-called diffusion-free scaling for the heat transfer cannot reconcile all numerical models with different $\Pran$ in the geostrophic turbulence regime. However, the characteristic flow speeds at different $\Pran$ roughly follow a unified scaling that can be described by VAC force balances, though the scaling tends to approach the CIA force balance at low $\Pran$. Both scaling behaviours and transition behaviours suggest that the heat transfer is controlled by the boundary layers while the convective flow speeds are mainly determined by the force balance in the bulk for cases with $\Pran&gt;1$, which is in line with recent experimental results with moderate to high $\Pran$. For cases with $\Pran \le 1$, both the heat transfer and convective velocities are approaching the inviscid dynamics in the bulk.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Floquet Approach to Parabolic PDEs, with Applications to Walking Droplet Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet theory provides a powerful tool for studying time-periodic dynamics, allowing the stability and long-time behavior of any periodic, linear ODE to be recast in terms of a linear time-invariant system. However, except when dealing with Hilbert spaces or certain well-behaved classes of operators, Floquet theory cannot be rigorously applied to PDEs without dimensional reduction. We describe a simple, rigorous extension of Floquet theory to a wide class of parabolic PDEs on Banach spaces, enabling direct application with minimal changes from the classical theory.
  To demonstrate the utility of the extended Floquet formalism, we investigate the statistics of 'walking droplets': millimetric oil droplets that self-propel over the surface of a vibrating oil bath. Walking droplets exhibit striking, emergent statistical patterns that are not yet fully understood. For instance, a widespread correspondence has been observed between the statistics of the droplet and the time-average of its guiding wave, but it has only been proved rigorously for a single droplet in an unbounded domain of uniform depth (Durey, Milewski, and Bush, 2018). We apply our Floquet results to derive the droplet-wave statistical correspondence in a highly general case, allowing for arbitrary geometries, multiple droplet interactions, and non-resonant droplet bouncing. Beyond walking droplets, our framework provides a versatile tool for analyzing periodic PDEs more broadly, with promising applications to tidal flows and nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) models under daily cycles.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer flow dynamics of propulsive flapping foils with increasing Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study flapping foils at optimally propulsive Strouhal number $St=0.3$ with increasing chord-based Reynolds number at $Re = 10^4$, $10^5$, and $10^6$ to examine changes in their unsteady boundary layers. Despite being prescribed the same freestream, the inner boundary layer characteristics exhibit different trends due to the generation of leading-edge vortices (LEVs) and their advection into the downstream flow. Propulsive flapping foils show an extended laminar region known as the \textit{relaminarization}, during which the velocity profiles deviate from the standard log law. This \textit{relaminarization} is accompanied by a significant decrease in the cyclic fluctuation of the wall friction coefficient and an increase in the shape factor while the freestream velocity increases under favourable pressure gradient conditions. This phenomenon intensifies with increasing $Re$. We found that higher $Re$ produces smaller LEVs in greater quantities, with a more rapid but stable breakdown, without resulting in a more chaotic turbulent downstream. This study strongly indicates that the \textit{relaminarization} could extend beyond $Re=10^6$ as predicted by \citet{Fukagata2023}. The results support the potential for further exploration of flapping foils at high $Re$ for noise and drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-analysis-inspired boundary conditions aiming at eliminating polymer diffusive instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of polymer diffusive instability (PDI) by Beneitez et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2023, 8: L101901) poses challenges in implementing artificial conformation diffusion (ACD) in transition simulations of viscoelastic wall-shear flows. In this paper, we demonstrate that the unstable PDI is primarily induced by the conformation boundary conditions additionally introduced in the ACD equation system, which could be eliminated if a new set of conformation conditions is adopted. To address this issue, we begin with an asymptotic analysis of the PDI within the near-wall thin diffusive layer, which simplifies the complexity of the instability system by reducing the number of the controlling parameters from five to zero. Then, based on this simplified model, we construct a stable asymptotic solution that minimises the perturbations in the wall sublayer. From the near-wall behaviour of this solution, we derive a new set of conformation boundary conditions, prescribing a Neumann-type condition for its streamwise stretching component, $c_{11}$, a Robin-type condition for its transverse shear component, $c_{12}$, and Dirichlet conditions for all the other conformation components. These boundary conditions are subsequently validated within the original ACD instability system, incorporating both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P constitutive models. Finally, we perform direct numerical simulations based on the traditional and the new conformation conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the latter in eliminating the unstable PDI. Importantly, this improvement does not affect the calculations of other types of instabilities. Therefore, this work offers a promising approach for achieving reliable polymer-flow simulations with ACD, ensuring both numerical stability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transport of Elongated Particles in Oscillatory Vortical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated particles in cellular vortical flows that undergo spatial oscillations over time. Experimental flow visualizations reveal mixed flow fields with chaotic and elliptic regions coexisting. Surprisingly, the particle transport rate does not increase monotonically with particle length, even though longer particles are expected to explore neighboring vortices more easily. Numerical simulations in a much larger system produce similar transport anomalies, characterized by subdiffusion due to frequent long-time trapping in vortices at certain lengths, but normal diffusion at others. At moderate oscillation frequencies, these long-time trapping events occur within the chaotic region; at high frequencies, they occur in the elliptic regions, but only for particles whose lengths match these regions. In the latter case, subdiffusion is robust against random noise. Our results reveal new mechanisms for controlling particle diffusion in fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Turbulent Concentric Annular Pipe Flow using One-Dimensional Turbulence (ODT): Part 1: Momentum Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent concentric coaxial (annular) pipe flow is numerically investigated using a stochastic one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model as a stand-alone tool. The dimensionally reduced ODT domain enables fully resolved numerical simulations of the flow across the radial gap between the cylindrical inner wall and the cylindrical outer wall. The model is calibrated with available reference data at low bulk Reynolds number $Re_{D_h} = 8900$ for a wide (radius ratio $\eta = 0.1$) and a moderate ($\eta = 0.5$) gap. Making use of the model's predictive capabilities, radius ratio and Reynolds number effects are investigated, reaching bulk Reynolds numbers as large as $Re_{D_h}=10^6$. Despite the large $Re_{D_h}$ values reached, spanwise wall-curvature effects remain sensible in the momentum boundary layer. The effects are more pronounced for larger wall curvature and to leading orders restricted to the convex cylindrical inner wall. Wall-curvature corrections to the law of the wall are obtained for both the viscous and Reynolds-stress dominated regions by fitting analytically derived expressions for the flow profile to the stochastic simulation data, demonstrating physical compatibility with Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes flow. Second-order and detailed fluctuation statistics demonstrate the permeating and nonlocal influence of spanwise wall curvature on the turbulent boundary layer. Surrogate model output in terms of conditional eddy event statistics reveals that the disparity between the near-inner and near-outer wall turbulence increases with Reynolds number for small radius ratios, suggesting that annular pipe flows require wall-curvature-aware wall models even at very large Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced turbulence in viscous binary fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of interface-induced turbulence, an emergent nonequilibrium statistically steady state (NESS) with spatiotemporal chaos, which is induced by interfacial fluctuations in low-Reynolds-number binary-fluid mixtures. We uncover the properties of this NESS via direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of cellular flows in the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for binary fluids. We show that, in this NESS, the shell-averaged energy spectrum $E(k)$ is spread over more than one decade in the wavenumber $k$ and it exhibits a power-law region, indicative of turbulence \textit{but without a conventional inertial cascade}. To characterize the statistical properties of this turbulence, we compute, in addition to $E(k)$, the time series $e(t)$ of the kinetic energy and its power spectrum, scale-by-scale energy transfer as a function of $k$, and the energy dissipation resulting from interfacial stresses. Furthermore, we analyze the mixing properties of this low-Reynolds-number turbulence via the mean-square displacement (MSD) of Lagrangian tracer particles, for which we demonstrate diffusive behavior at long times, a hallmark of strong mixing in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>An Implicit Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator for Long-term Predictions of Three-dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term prediction of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning approaches. Although some existing machine learning approaches such as implicit U-net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) have been proven to be capable of achieving stable long-term predictions for turbulent flows, their computational costs are usually high. In this paper, we use the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO) as the backbone to construct a model that can predict 3D turbulence. Furthermore, we employ the implicit iteration to our constructed AFNO and propose the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO). IAFNO is systematically tested in three types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. The numerical results demonstrate that IAFNO is more accurate than IUFNO and the traditional large-eddy simulation using dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), while exhibiting greater stability compared to IUFNO. Meanwhile, the AFNO model exhibits instability in numerical simulations. Moreover, the training efficiency of IAFNO is 4 times higher than that of IUFNO, and the number of parameters and GPU memory occupation of IAFNO are only 1/80 and 1/3 of IUFNO, respectively in HIT. In other tests, the improvements are slightly lower but still considerable. These improvements mainly come from patching and self-attention in 3D space. Besides, the well-trained IAFNO is significantly faster than the DSM. The code (and datasets) of the current work can be accessed at https://github.com/yuchi-richard-jiang/IAFNO.</description>
