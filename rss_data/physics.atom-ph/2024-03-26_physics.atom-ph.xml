      <title>Coulomb excitation of hydrogen atoms by vortex ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb excitation of hydrogen atoms by vortex protons is theoretically investigated within the framework of the non--relativistic first--Born approximation and the density matrix approach. Special attention is paid to the magnetic sublevel population of excited atoms and, consequently, to the angular distribution of the fluorescence radiation. We argue that both these properties are sensitive to the projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM), carried by the projectile ions. In order to illustrate the OAM--effect, detailed calculations have been performed for the $1s \to 2p$ excitation and the subsequent $2p \to 1s$ radiative decay of a hydrogen target, interacting with incident Laguerre--Gaussian vortex protons. The calculation results suggest that Coulomb excitation can be employed for the diagnostics of vortex ion beam at accelerator and storage ring facilities.</description>

      <title>Effect of light-assisted tunable interaction on the position response function of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The position response of a particle subjected to a perturbation is of general interest in physics. We study the modification of the position response function of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap in the presence of tunable light-assisted interactions. We subject the cold atoms to an intense laser light tuned near the photoassociation resonance and observe the position response of the atoms subjected to a sudden displacement. Surprisingly, we observe that the entire cold atomic cloud undergoes collective oscillations. We use a generalised quantum Langevin approach to theoretically analyse the results of the experiments and find good agreement.</description>

      <title>Convert laser light into single photons via interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum electrodynamics and interference.</description>

      <title>CPT and Lorentz symmetry tests with hydrogen using a novel in-beam hyperfine spectroscopy method applicable to antihydrogen experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Rabi-type measurement of two ground-state hydrogen hyperfine transitions performed in two opposite external magnetic field directions. This puts first constraints at the level of 2.3 10^-21 GeV on a set of coefficients of the Standard Model Extension, which were not measured by previous experiments. Moreover, we introduce a novel method, applicable to antihydrogen hyperfine spectroscopy in a beam, that determines the zero-field hyperfine transition frequency from the two transitions measured at the same magnetic field. Our value, nu_0 = 1.420 405 751 63(63) GHz, is in agreement with literature at a relative precision of 0.44 ppb. This is the highest precision achieved on hydrogen in a beam, improving over previous results by a factor of 6.</description>

      <title>Universal entropy transport far from equilibrium across the BCS-BEC crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of strongly interacting fermionic systems can reveal exotic states of matter, but experiments and theory have predominantly focused on bulk systems in the hydrodynamic limit describable with linear response coefficients such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In a ballistic channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs, recent experiments revealed a far-from-equilibrium regime beyond linear hydrodynamics where particle and entropy currents respond nonlinearly to biases of chemical potential and temperature, and their ratio is robust to the channel geometry. However, the origin of this robustness and its relation to the strong interparticle interactions remain unknown. Here, we study the coupled transport of particles and entropy tuning the interaction across the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer to Bose-Einstein condensate (BCS-BEC) crossover, the reservoir degeneracy across the superfluid phase transition, as well as the local potentials and confinement of the channel. Surprisingly, the entropy advectively transported per particle depends only on the interactions and reservoir degeneracy and not on the details of the channel, suggesting that this property has its origin in the universal equilibrium properties of the reservoirs. In contrast, the magnitudes of the advective and diffusive entropy currents vary significantly with the channel details. The advective current increases monotonically towards the BEC side, which can be largely explained by the estimated superfluid gap in the channel. The Wiedemann-Franz law that links the advective and diffusive currents in Fermi liquids is most egregiously violated at unitarity, suggesting a change in the nature of the excitations responsible for entropy diffusion near unitarity. These observations pose fundamental questions regarding transport phenomena in strongly interacting Fermi systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Searching for large dark matter clumps using the Galileo Satnav clock variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of isotope shifts in the barium 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ - 5d6p $^3$D$^\text{o}_1$ transition</title>

Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of isotope shifts of the barium 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ - 5d6p $^3$D$^\text{o}_1$ 413nm electric quadrupole transition, which is utilized for efficient barium ion trapping via photoionization using a single coherent light source. The measured isotope shifts relative to $^{138}$Ba are $392.5\pm0.6$ MHz, $177.8\pm0.4$ MHz, $400.6\pm1.0$ MHz, and $125.9\pm1.4$ MHz for isotopes with atomic number 137, 136, 135 and 134, respectively. We verified the measured isotopes with King plot analysis and compared the result with the formerly known shifts inferred from previous studies on neighboring transitions. The results could be used for efficient isotope selective loading of low-abundant barium ions, while careful suppression of line broadening is required for successful isotopic selectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical modeling of the multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e</title>

Abstract: The multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e includes two cascaded quantum measurements with a nonadiabatic flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter quantum sensing and magnetic communications with a hybrid dc and rf optically pumped magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM) that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude, spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz} in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation, reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than \SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, by placing a quantum system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Non-equilibrium Electron Effects on the Collisional Ionization Rate in the Collisional-Radiative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of kinetic electron physics and atomic processes in ultrashort laser-plasma interactions provides a comprehensive understanding of electron energy distribution's impact on plasma properties. Notably, non-equilibrium electrons play a vital role in collisional ionization, influencing ionization degrees and spectra. This paper introduces a computational model that integrates the physics of kinetic electrons and atomic processes, utilizing a Boltzmann equation for non-equilibrium electrons and a collisional-radiative model for atomic state populations. The model is used to investigate the influence of non-equilibrium electrons on collisional ionization rates and their effect on population distribution, as demonstrated by L. Young et al. (Nature, 2010). The study reveals significant non-equilibrium electron presence during XFEL-matter interactions, profoundly affecting collisional ionization rates in the gas plasma, thereby necessitating careful consideration of the Collisional-Radiative (CR) model applied to such systems.</description>
