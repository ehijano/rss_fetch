      <title>Smooth Actual EIRP Control for EMF Compliance with Minimum Traffic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate end-user exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF), health regulations impose limitations on the Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) averaged over a sliding time window, called actual EIRP. We aim to enable base stations to adhere to these regulations while mitigating any adverse effects on user performance. Specifically, our objectives are to: i) ensure compliance with EMF regulations by imposing limits on the actual EIRP, ii) maintain a minimum EIRP level, and iii) prevent resource shortages at all times. Initially, we present exact and conservative algorithms to compute the actual EIRP budget, i.e., the set of feasible EIRP consumption values that fulfill constraints i) and ii) at any given time. Subsequently, we design a control method based on Drift-Plus-Penalty theory to preemptively curb EIRP consumption and avoid future resource shortages.</description>

      <title>New Partial Orders of Polar Codes for BMSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define partial orders (POs) of polar codes based on the Bhattacharyya parameter and the bit-error probability, respectively. These POs are applicable to arbitrary binary memoryless symmetric channel (BMSC). Leveraging the extremal inequalities of polarization transformation, we derive new POs for BMSC based on the corresponding POs observed in the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). %Additionally, we discover more special POs in the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). We provide examples that demonstrate the inability of existing POs to deduce these novel POs. Furthermore, we establish upper bounds for the expansion parameter $\beta$ if the polar codes constructed by $\beta$-expansion method obey these POs.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Channel Estimation for Dense Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By deploying a large number of antennas with sub-half-wavelength spacing in a compact space, dense array systems(DASs) can fully unleash the multiplexing-and-diversity gains of limited apertures. To acquire these gains, accurate channel state information acquisition is necessary but challenging due to the large antenna numbers. To overcome this obstacle, this paper reveals that exploiting the high spatial correlation of DAS channels is crucial while designing the observation matrix for optimal/near-optimal channel estimation. Firstly, we prove that the observation matrix design is equivalent to a time-domain duality of multiple-input multiple-output precoding, which can be ideally addressed by the water-filling principle. For practical realizations, a novel ice-filling algorithm is proposed to design amplitude-and-phase controllable observation matrices, and a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to address the phase-only controllable case. Particularly, we prove that the ice-filling algorithm can be viewed as a ``quantized" water-filling algorithm. To support the sub-optimality of the proposed designs, we provide comprehensive analyses on the achievable mean square errors and their asymptotic expressions. Finally, numerical simulations verify that our proposed channel estimation designs can achieve the near-optimal performance and outperform existing approaches significantly.</description>

      <title>Joint Active And Passive IRS Aided Wireless Communication: Elements Allocation and Achievable Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipping reflecting elements at the active intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS) enhances signal amplification capability but meanwhile incurs non-negligible amplification noise, which thus challenges the determination of elements allocation for maximizing achievable rate in multi-cooperative AIRS and passive IRS (PIRS) jointly aided wireless communication system. To tackle this issue, we consider the downlink communication from a single-antenna transmitter (Tx) to a single-antenna receiver (Rx), which aided by a pair of AIRS and PIRS with two different deployment orders. Specifically, we target to determine the number of AIRS/PIRS elements over both transmission orders under given deployment budget for the achievable rate maximization. Our analysis illustrates that the PIRS should be allocated more elements than the AIRS for achieving optimized rate and linear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling orders are attained in both schemes. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the rate performance of the AIRS and PIRS jointly aided wireless system with various benchmark systems.</description>

      <title>Demand Private Coded Caching: the Two-File Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files. Then, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, we derive some new converse bounds. As a result, we obtain the exact memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users. As for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, the exact memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in [0,\frac{2}{K}] \cup [\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2]$.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Secure Key Agreement Over a Full Duplex Wireless Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret key generation (SKG) between authenticated devices is a pivotal task for secure communications. Diffie-Hellman (DH) is de-facto standard but not post-quantum secure. In this paper, we shall invent and analyze a new security primitive that is specifically designed for WPAN. For WPAN, wireless channel-based SKG has been proposed but was not widely deployed due to its critical dependence on the channel's entropy which is uncontrollable. We formulate a different approach: We still exploit channel properties but mainly hinge on the reciprocity of the wireless channel and not on the channel's entropy. The radio advantage comes from the use of full duplex communication. We show that in this situation both legitimate parties can agree on a common secret key even without ever probing the channel at all. At the core is a new bisparse blind deconvolution scheme for which we prove correctness and information-theoretic, i.e. perfect, security. We show that, ultimately, a secret key can be extracted and give a lower bound for the number of secret key bits which is then verified by experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of IRS-Assisted SSK and RPM over Rician Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the index modulation, that is, the space-shift keying (SSK) and reflection phase modulation (RPM) schemes for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless network. IRS simultaneously reflects the incoming information signal from the base station and explicitly encodes the local information bits in the reflection phase shift of IRS elements. The phase shift of the IRS elements is employed according to local data from the RPM constellation. A joint detection using a maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder is performed for the SSK and RPM symbols over a realistic fading scenario modeled as the Rician fading channel. The pairwise error probability over Rician fading channels is derived and utilized to determine the average bit error rate. In addition, the ergodic capacity of the presented system is derived. The derived analytical results are verified and are in exact agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Digital Over-the-Air Computation: Achieving High Reliability via Bit-Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G mobile networks aim to realize ubiquitous intelligence at the network edge via distributed learning, sensing, and data analytics. Their common operation is to aggregate high-dimensional data, which causes a communication bottleneck that cannot be resolved using traditional orthogonal multi-access schemes. A promising solution, called over-the-air computation (AirComp), exploits channels' waveform superposition property to enable simultaneous access, thereby overcoming the bottleneck. Nevertheless, its reliance on uncoded linear analog modulation exposes data to perturbation by noise and interference. Hence, the traditional analog AirComp falls short of meeting the high-reliability requirement for 6G. Overcoming the limitation of analog AirComp motivates this work, which focuses on developing a framework for digital AirComp. The proposed framework features digital modulation of each data value, integrated with the bit-slicing technique to allocate its bits to multiple symbols, thereby increasing the AirComp reliability. To optimally detect the aggregated digital symbols, we derive the optimal maximum a posteriori detector that is shown to outperform the traditional maximum likelihood detector. Furthermore, a comparative performance analysis of digital AirComp with respect to its analog counterpart with repetition coding is conducted to quantify the practical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime favoring the proposed scheme. On the other hand, digital AirComp is enhanced by further development to feature awareness of heterogeneous bit importance levels and its exploitation in channel adaptation. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate the achivability of substantial reliability improvement of digital AirComp over its analog counterpart given the same channel uses.</description>

      <title>Characterising directed and undirected metrics of high-order interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of interest for theoretical or experimental work often exhibit high-order interactions, corresponding to statistical interdependencies in groups of variables that cannot be reduced to dependencies in subsets of them. While still under active development, the framework of partial information decomposition (PID) has emerged as the dominant approach to conceptualise and calculate high-order interdependencies. PID approaches can be grouped in two types: directed approaches that divide variables into sources and targets, and undirected approaches that treat all variables equally. Directed and undirected approaches are usually employed to investigate different scenarios, and hence little is known about how these two types of approaches may relate to each other, or if their corresponding quantities are linked in some way. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the redundancy-synergy index (RSI) and the O-information, which are practical metrics of directed and undirected high-order interdependencies, respectively. Our results reveal tight links between these two quantities, and provide interpretations of them in terms of likelihood ratios in a hypothesis testing setting, as well as in terms of projections in information geometry.</description>

      <title>Fractional decoding of algebraic geometry codes over extension fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study algebraic geometry codes from curves over $\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell}$ through their virtual projections which are algebraic geometric codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We use the virtual projections to provide fractional decoding algorithms for the codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell}$. Fractional decoding seeks to perform error correction using a smaller fraction of $\mathbb{F}_q$-symbols than a typical decoding algorithm. In one instance, the bound on the number of correctable errors differs from the usual lower bound by the degree of a pole divisor of an annihilator function. In another, we view the virtual projections as interleaved codes to, with high probability, correct more errors than anticipated.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy bounds for sampling with and without replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharp, nonasymptotic bounds are obtained for the relative entropy between the distributions of sampling with and without replacement from an urn with balls of $c\geq 2$ colors. Our bounds are asymptotically tight in certain regimes and, unlike previous results, they depend on the number of balls of each colour in the urn. The connection of these results with finite de Finetti-style theorems is explored, and it is observed that a sampling bound due to Stam (1978) combined with the convexity of relative entropy yield a new finite de Finetti bound in relative entropy, which achieves the optimal asymptotic convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory for Learning Semantic Languages by Abstract Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the emergence of capabilities (learned skills) when the number of system parameters and the size of training data surpass certain thresholds. The exact mechanisms behind such phenomena are not fully understood and remain a topic of active research. Inspired by the skill-text bipartite graph model presented in [1] for modeling semantic language, we develop a mathematical theory to explain the emergence of learned skills, taking the learning (or training) process into account. Our approach models the learning process for skills in the skill-text bipartite graph as an iterative decoding process in Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes and Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). Using density evolution analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of learned skills when the ratio of the size of training texts to the number of skills exceeds a certain threshold. Our analysis also yields a scaling law for testing errors relative to the size of training texts. Upon completion of the training, we propose a method for semantic compression and discuss its application in semantic communication.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the $w$-weight enumerators of weights $w$ with maximal symmetry over finite chain rings and matrix rings over finite fields. In many cases, including the homogeneous weight, the MacWilliams identities for $w$-weight enumerators fail because there exist two linear codes with the same $w$-weight enumerator whose dual codes have different $w$-weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Feedback Capacity of the Continuous-Time ARMA(1,1) Gaussian Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the continuous-time ARMA(1,1) Gaussian channel and derive its feedback capacity in closed form. More specifically, the channel is given by $\boldsymbol{y}(t) =\boldsymbol{x}(t) +\boldsymbol{z}(t)$, where the channel input $\{\boldsymbol{x}(t) \}$ satisfies average power constraint $P$ and the noise $\{\boldsymbol{z}(t)\}$ is a first-order {\em autoregressive moving average} (ARMA(1,1)) Gaussian process satisfying $$ \boldsymbol{z}^\prime(t)+\kappa \boldsymbol{z}(t)=(\kappa+\lambda)\boldsymbol{w}(t)+\boldsymbol{w}^\prime(t), $$ where $\kappa&gt;0,~\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\{\boldsymbol{w}(t) \}$ is a white Gaussian process with unit double-sided spectral density.
  We show that the feedback capacity of this channel is equal to the unique positive root of the equation $$ P(x+\kappa)^2 = 2x(x+\vert \kappa+\lambda\vert)^2 $$ when $-2\kappa&lt;\lambda&lt;0$ and is equal to $P/2$ otherwise. Among many others, this result shows that, as opposed to a discrete-time additive Gaussian channel, feedback may not increase the capacity of a continuous-time additive Gaussian channel even if the noise process is colored. The formula enables us to conduct a thorough analysis of the effect of feedback on the capacity for such a channel. We characterize when the feedback capacity equals or doubles the non-feedback capacity; moreover, we disprove continuous-time analogues of the half-bit bound and Cover's $2P$ conjecture for discrete-time additive Gaussian channels.</description>

      <title>RIS-Jamming: Breaking Key Consistency in Channel Reciprocity-based Key Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel Reciprocity-based Key Generation (CRKG) exploits reciprocal channel randomness to establish shared secret keys between wireless terminals. This new security technique is expected to complement existing cryptographic techniques for secret key distribution of future wireless networks. In this paper, we present a new attack, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) jamming, and show that an attacker can prevent legitimate users from agreeing on the same key by deploying a malicious RIS to break channel reciprocity. Specifically, we elaborate on three examples to implement the RIS jamming attack: Using active nonreciprocal circuits, performing time-varying controls, and reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. The attack effect is then studied by formulating the secret key rate with a relationship to the deployment of RIS. To resist such RIS jamming attacks, we propose a countermeasure that exploits wideband signals for multipath separation. The malicious RIS path is distinguished from all separated channel paths, and thus the countermeasure is referred to as contaminated path removal-based CRKG(CRP-CRKG). We present simulation results, showing that legitimate users under RIS jamming are still able to generate secret keys from the remaining paths. We also experimentally demonstrate the RIS jamming attack by using commodity Wi-Fi devices in conjunction with a fabricated RIS prototype. In our experiments, we were able to increase the average bit disagreement ratio (BDR) of raw secret keys by 20%. Further, we successfully demonstrate the proposed CRP-CRKG countermeasure to tackle RIS jamming in wideband systems as long as the source of randomness and the RIS propagation paths are separable.</description>

      <title>Competitive Advantage of Huffman and Shannon-Fano Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite discrete source, the competitive advantage of prefix code $C_1$ over prefix code $C_2$ is the probability $C_1$ produces a shorter codeword than $C_2$, minus the probability $C_2$ produces a shorter codeword than $C_1$. For any source, a prefix code is competitively optimal if it has a nonnegative competitive advantage over all other prefix codes. In 1991, Cover proved that Huffman codes are competitively optimal for all dyadic sources, namely sources whose symbol probabilities are negative integer powers of $2$. We prove the following asymptotic converse: As the source size grows, the probability a Huffman code for a randomly chosen non-dyadic source is competitively optimal converges to zero. We also prove: (i) For any non-dyadic source, a Huffman code has a positive competitive advantage over a Shannon-Fano code; (ii) For any source, the competitive advantage of any prefix code over a Huffman code is strictly less than $\frac{1}{3}$; (iii) For each integer $n&gt;3$, there exists a source of size $n$ and some prefix code whose competitive advantage over a Huffman code is arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{3}$; and (iv) For each positive integer $n$, there exists a source of size $n$ and some prefix code whose competitive advantage over a Shannon-Fano code becomes arbitrarily close to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Quantum message-passing algorithm for optimal and efficient decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Renes proposed a quantum algorithm called belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) for decoding classical data encoded using a binary linear code with tree Tanner graph that is transmitted over a pure-state CQ channel [Renes, NJP 19 072001 (2017)]. The algorithm presents a genuine quantum counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm, which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. More recently Rengaswamy et al. [npj Quantum Information 7 97 (2021)] observed that BPQM implements the optimal decoder on a small example code. Here we significantly expand the understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum circuit realizations will be exponentially large in the code dimension. Although BPQM passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is processed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has quantum circuit complexity $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly } n, \text{polylog } \frac{1}{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the code length and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning. We show some promising numerical results that indicate that BPQM on factor graphs with cycles can significantly outperform the best possible classical decoder.</description>

      <title>Theory of Compression Channels for Post-selected Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-selected quantum metrological scheme is especially advantageous when the final measurements are either very noisy or expensive in practical experiments. In this work, we put forward a general theory on the compression channels in post-selected metrology. We define the basic notions characterizing the compression quality and illuminate the underlying structure of lossless compression channels. Previous experiments on post-selected optical phase estimation and weak-value amplification are shown to be particular cases of this general theory. Furthermore, for two categories of bipartite systems, we show that the compression loss can be made arbitrarily small even when the compression channel acts only on one subsystem. These findings can be employed to distribute quantum measurements so that the measurement noise and cost are dramatically reduced.</description>

      <title>Bridging Algorithmic Information Theory and Machine Learning: A New Approach to Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) look at Complexity from different points of view. We explore the interface between AIT and Kernel Methods (that are prevalent in ML) by adopting an AIT perspective on the problem of learning kernels from data, in kernel ridge regression, through the method of Sparse Kernel Flows. In particular, by looking at the differences and commonalities between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and Regularization in Machine Learning (RML), we prove that the method of Sparse Kernel Flows is the natural approach to adopt to learn kernels from data. This approach aligns naturally with the MDL principle, offering a more robust theoretical basis than the existing reliance on cross-validation. The study reveals that deriving Sparse Kernel Flows does not require a statistical approach; instead, one can directly engage with code-lengths and complexities, concepts central to AIT. Thereby, this approach opens the door to reformulating algorithms in machine learning using tools from AIT, with the aim of providing them a more solid theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Multi-Server Jobs is Not Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of online scheduling of multi-server jobs is considered, where there are a total of $K$ servers, and each job requires concurrent service from multiple servers for it to be processed. Each job on its arrival reveals its processing time, the number of servers from which it needs concurrent service and an online algorithm has to make scheduling decisions using only causal information, with the goal of minimizing the response/flow time. The worst case input model is considered and the performance metric is the competitive ratio. For the case, when all job processing time (sizes) are the same, we show that the competitive ratio of any deterministic/randomized algorithm is at least $\Omega(K)$ and propose an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most $K+1$. With equal job sizes, we also consider the resource augmentation regime where an online algorithm has access to more servers than an optimal offline algorithm. With resource augmentation, we propose a simple algorithm and show that it has a competitive ratio of $1$ when provided with $2K$ servers with respect to an optimal offline algorithm with $K$ servers. With unequal job sizes, we propose an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most $2K \log (K w_{\max})$, where $w_{\max}$ is the maximum size of any job.</description>
