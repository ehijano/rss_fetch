      <title>Integrating epidemiological and economic models to estimate the cost of simulated foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) leads to substantial economic impacts through animal loss, decreased livestock and meat production, increased government and private spending on control and eradication measures, and trade restrictions. This study evaluates the direct cost-effectiveness of four control and eradication scenarios of hypothetical FMD outbreaks in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Our model simulation considered scenarios with depopulation of detected farms and emergency vaccination and two enhanced scenarios featuring increased capacity for emergency vaccination and depopulation. FMD outbreaks were simulated using a multi-host, single-pathogen Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model incorporating species-specific transmission probabilities, within-farm dynamics, and spatial transmission factors. The economic cost evaluation encompassed animal elimination (a.k.a. depopulation), carcass disposal, visits by animal health officials, laboratory testing, emergency vaccination, and sanitary barriers (a.k.a. traffic-control points), and movement restrictions due to control zones. Our results provided a range of predicted costs for a potential reintroduction of FMD ranging from $977,128 to $52,275,811. Depopulation was the most expensive, followed by local traffic control points and emergency vaccination. Our results demonstrated that higher rates of depopulation, or depopulation combined with vaccination, were the most effective strategies to reduce long-term economic impacts despite higher initial costs. Allocating more resources early in the outbreak was cost-effective in minimizing the overall effect and achieving faster eradication.</description>

      <title>The devasting economic impact of Callinectes sapidus on the clam fishing in the Po Delta (Italy): Striking evidence from novel field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invasive species are a growing threat to marine ecosystems, and the recent proliferation of the Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) in the Po Delta (Italy) has had significant ecological and economic impacts, particularly on clam farming. This study explores the influence of C. sapidus on clam production in the Po Delta, combining biological and ecological data with socio-economic analysis. Field data collected between August and December 2023 from the Canarin and Scardovari Lagoons revealed seasonal fluctuations in crab abundance, with a peak in captures during the warmer months. The predatory behaviour of C. sapidus has led to a sharp decline in clam production, reaching near-zero levels in early 2024. Statistical analysis confirmed a strong correlation between the increase of the invasive crab population and the decrease in clam yields. This study also explores potential management strategies, including the economic valorisation of C. sapidus as a commercial resource, turning an ecological challenge into an opportunity. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted management interventions to mitigate the impact of this invasive species on local fisheries and ecosystems.</description>

      <title>On properties driving diversity index selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenies are commonly used to represent the evolutionary relationships between species, and often these phylogenies are equipped with edge lengths that indicate degrees of evolutionary difference. Given such a phylogeny, a popular measure for the biodiversity of a subset of the species is the phylogenetic diversity (PD). But if we want to focus conservation efforts on particular species, we may use a phylogenetic diversity index, a function that shares out the PD value of an entire phylogeny across all of its species. With these indices, various species-level conservation strategies can be evaluated. This work explores how the most suitable diversity indices can be found. In particular, how formalizing the requirement for diversity indices to capture high levels of PD, or to maintain a scoring of taxa in the presence of uncertain edge lengths drives the selection of a suitable index. Furthermore, we provide illustrations of these new mechanisms for diversity index selection in a case study. This analysis includes the comparison to popular phylogenetic indices from the conservation literature.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behavior, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this framework, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.</description>

      <title>Insuperable strategies in two-player and reducible multi-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real populations are seldom found at the Nash equilibrium strategy. The present work focuses on how population size can be a relevant evolutionary force diverting the population from its expected Nash equilibrium. We introduce the concept of insuperable strategy, a strategy that guarantees that no other player can have a larger payoff than the player that adopts it. We show that this concept is different from the rationality assumption frequently used in game theory and that for small populations the insuperable strategy is the most probable evolutionary outcome for any dynamics that equal game payoff and reproductive fitness. We support our ideas with several examples and numerical simulations. We finally discuss how to extend the concept to multiplayer games, introducing, in a limited way, the concept of game reduction.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics in the global coral symbiont network under temperature variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coral reefs are crucial to marine biodiversity and rely on a delicate symbiotic relationship between corals and zooxanthellae algae. Water temperature variations, however, disrupt this association, leading to coral bleaching events that severely affect marine ecosystems. This study presents a mathematical model for the population dynamics of coral and symbiont species considering the coral symbiont network and recurrent warming events. The model incorporates thermal tolerances of species and coupled growth dynamics (between corals and symbionts) to investigate how network structure and thermal tolerance influence the species' growth. Using real data from different ocean regions, results reveal that network connectivity plays a significant role in population growth after successive warming events, with generalist species demonstrating greater growth across all regions analyzed. The comparatively higher correlation between node degree and final population also emphasizes the impact of ecological network structure on species growth, offering valuable insights into coral reef population dynamics under climate change. This research highlights the need to consider network structure beyond species' thermal tolerances when evaluating the ecological responses of corals to environmental changes.</description>
