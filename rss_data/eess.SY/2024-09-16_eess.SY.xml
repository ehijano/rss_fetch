      <title>Iterative Convex Optimization for Safety-Critical Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is one of the fundamental challenges in control theory. Recently, multi-step optimal control problems for discrete-time dynamical systems were developed to ensure stability, while adhering to input constraints and safety-critical requirements. This was achieved by incorporating discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. Existing work usually centers on the feasibility or safety of optimization problems when the boundaries of safe sets are clearly defined. Most of this research limits discussions to CBFs with relative degree one with respect to the system dynamics. Furthermore, real-time computation becomes challenging in MPC problems with large horizons. In this paper, we introduce a framework that addresses the safety-critical MPC problem through iterative optimization, applicable across CBFs of any relative degree. Our approach involves linearizing the nonlinear system dynamics and safety constraints, modeled as Discrete-time High-Order CBFs (DHOCBFs), at each time step. Additionally, when the boundaries of the safe sets are complex, we present a learning-based method to develop linear boundary equations for these safe sets. These equations are then converted into linearized DHOCBFs. The benefits of computational performance and safe avoidance of obstacles with diverse shapes are examined and confirmed through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reinforcement Learning with Stability Guarantees for Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a stabilizing controller for nonlinear systems is a challenging task, especially for high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms applied to stabilization tasks tend to drive the system close to the equilibrium point. However, these approaches often fall short of achieving true stabilization and result in persistent oscillations around the equilibrium point. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes the system by learning a local linear representation ofthe dynamics. The main component of the algorithm is integrating the learned gain matrix directly into the neural policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several challenging high-dimensional dynamical systems. In these simulations, our algorithm outperforms popular reinforcement learning algorithms, such as soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO), and successfully stabilizes the system. To support the numerical results, we provide a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of the learned algorithm for both deterministic and stochastic reinforcement learning settings, along with a convergence analysis of the proposed learning algorithm. Furthermore, we verify that the learned control policies indeed provide asymptotic stability for the nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Social Equity Based Optimal Power Flow Framework to Hedge Against Price Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency of high impact low probability events, electricity markets are experiencing significant price spikes more often. This paper proposes a novel social equity driven optimal power flow framework to mitigate the adverse effects of price events that lead to such price spikes. The framework integrates social welfare optimization with socioeconomic considerations by including a socioeconomic score that quantifies the energy burden and socioeconomic status of consumers. By incorporating both supply cost and consumer satisfaction, the model aims to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of resources during price events, while considering resource scarcity and possible load curtailment. The proposed framework is tested for convergence on modified versions of the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 24-bus reliability test system, discussing its potential effectiveness in enhancing social equity and optimizing power flow under system security constraints. Sensitivity analysis further highlights the impact of socioeconomic score on social welfare, providing insights for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Safety of Linear Systems under Severe Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems can be subject to sensor attacks, e.g., sensor spoofing, leading to unsafe behaviors. This paper addresses this problem in the context of linear systems when an omniscient attacker can spoof several system sensors at will. In this adversarial environment, existing results have derived necessary and sufficient conditions under which the state estimation problem has a unique solution. In this work, we consider a severe attacking scenario when such conditions do not hold. To deal with potential state estimation uncertainty, we derive an exact characterization of the set of all possible state estimates. Using the framework of control barrier functions, we propose design principles for system safety in offline and online phases. For the offline phase, we derive conditions on safe sets for all possible sensor attacks that may be encountered during system deployment. For the online phase, with past system measurements collected, a quadratic program-based safety filter is proposed to enforce system safety. A 2D-vehicle example is used to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Global and Distributed Reproduction Numbers of a Multilayer SIR Model with an Infrastructure Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an SIR spread model in a population network coupled with an infrastructure network that has a pathogen spreading in it. We develop a threshold condition to characterize the monotonicity and peak time of a weighted average of the infection states in terms of the global (network-wide) effective reproduction number. We further define the distributed reproduction numbers (DRNs) of each node in the multilayer network which are used to provide local threshold conditions for the dynamical behavior of each entity. Furthermore, we leverage the DRNs to predict the global behavior based on the node-level assumptions. We use both analytical and simulation results to illustrate that the DRNs allow a more accurate analysis of the networked spreading process than the global effective reproduction number.</description>

      <title>An Intent Modeling and Inference Framework for Autonomous and Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intent modelling and inference framework is presented to assist the defense planning for protecting a geo-fence against unauthorized flights. First, a novel mathematical definition for the intent of an uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) is presented. The concepts of critical waypoints and critical waypoint patterns are introduced and associated with a motion process to fully characterize an intent. This modelling framework consists of representations of a UAS mission planner, used to plan the aircraft's motion sequence, as well as a defense planner, defined to protect the geo-fence. It is applicable to autonomous, semi-autonomous, and piloted systems in 2D and 3D environments with obstacles. The framework is illustrated by defining a library of intents for a security application. Detection and tracking of the target are presumed for formulating the intent inference problem. Multiple formulations of the decision maker's objective are discussed as part of a deep-learning-based methodology. Further, a multi-modal dynamic model for characterizing the UAS flight is discussed. This is later utilized to extract features using the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter for training the intent classifier. Finally, as part of the simulation study, an attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for intent inference is presented. The simulation experiments illustrate various aspects of the framework, including trajectory generation, radar measurement simulation, etc., in 2D and 3D environments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Nonlinear Path-following Guidance with Bounded Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately.</description>

      <title>OIDM: An Observability-based Intelligent Distributed Edge Sensing Method for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) integrate physical processes with computational and communication technologies in industrial settings. With the support of edge computing technology, it is feasible to schedule large-scale sensors for efficient distributed sensing. In the sensing process, observability is the key to obtaining complete system states, and stochastic scheduling is more suitable considering uncertain factors in wireless communication. However, existing works have limited research on observability in stochastic scheduling. Targeting this issue, we propose an observability-based intelligent distributed edge sensing method (OIDM). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are adopted to optimize sensing accuracy and power efficiency. Based on the system's ability to achieve observability, we establish a bridge between observability and the number of successful sensor transmissions. Novel linear approximations of observability criteria are provided, and probabilistic bounds on observability are derived. Furthermore, these bounds guide the design of action space to achieve a probabilistic observability guarantee in stochastic scheduling. Finally, our proposed method is applied to the estimation of slab temperature in industrial hot rolling process, and simulation results validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Gershgorin's theorem. Analysis and design of control laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the Gershgorin circle theorem and some of its derivatives to estimate the eigenvalues of a matrix is considered. The obtained results are developed to obtain the localization region of the eigenvalues of a matrix with interval-indefinite constant or non-stationary elements. The concept of e-circles is introduced to obtain more accurate estimates of these regions than when using Gershgorin circles. The obtained results are applied to the stability analysis of network systems, where it is shown that the proposed methods allow one to analyze a network with a much larger number of agents than when using the CVX, Yalmip, eig and lyap methods (functions in MatLab). It is further shown that if the obtained results are applied not to the system itself, but to the result obtained using the Lyapunov function method, then one can study systems with matrices without diagonal dominance. This made it possible to consider a modification of the Demidovich condition for systems with non-stationary parameters and design of a control law for non-stationary systems with matrices without diagonal dominance. All obtained results are illustrated by numerical modeling.</description>

      <title>Winning Strategy Templates for Stochastic Parity Games towards Permissive and Resilient Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic games play an important role for many purposes such as the control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where the controller and the environment are modeled as players. Conventional algorithms typically solve the game for a single winning strategy in order to develop a controller. However, in applications such as CPS control, permissive controllers are crucial as they allow the controlled system to adapt if additional constraints need to be imposed and also remain resilient to system changes at runtime. In this work, we generalize the concept of permissive winning strategy templates, introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to encompass stochastic games. These templates represent an infinite number of winning strategies and can adapt strategies to system changes efficiently. We focus on five key winning objectives -- safety, reachability, B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and parity -- and present algorithms to construct templates for each objective. In addition, we propose a novel method to extract a winning strategy from a template and provide discussions on template comparison.</description>

      <title>Global Minimum Energy State Estimation for Embedded Nonlinear Systems with Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing a nonlinear state estimator for an application often involves a trade-off between local optimality (such as provided by an extended Kalman filter) and (almost-/semi-) global asymptotic stability (such as provided by a constructive observer design based on Lyapunov principles). This paper proposes a filter design methodology that is both global and optimal for a class of nonlinear systems. In particular, systems for which there is an embedding of the state-manifold into Euclidean space for which the measurement function is linear in the embedding space and for which there is a synchronous error construction. A novel observer is derived using the minimum energy filter design paradigm and exploiting the embedding coordinates to solve for the globally optimal solution exactly. The observer is demonstrated through an application to the problem of unit quaternion attitude estimation, by embedding the 3-dimensional nonlinear system into a 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Simulation results demonstrate that the state estimate remains optimal for all time and converges even with a very large initial error.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of Information Constrained Linear State Estimation with Mixed-Binary Variables for Outlier Accommodation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers the challenge of accommodating outlier measurements in state estimation. The Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation approach addresses outliers as a measurement selection Bayesian risk minimization problem subject to an information accuracy constraint, which is a non-convex optimization problem. Prior explorations into RAPS rely on exhaustive search, which becomes computationally infeasible as the number of measurements increases. This paper derives a convex formulation for the RAPS optimization problems via transforming the mixed-binary variables into linear constraints. The convex reformulation herein can be solved by convex programming toolboxes, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. We explore two specifications: Full-RAPS, utilizing the full information matrix, and Diag-RAPS, focusing on diagonal elements only. The simulation comparison demonstrates that Diag-RAPS is faster and more efficient than Full-RAPS. In comparison with Kalman Filter (KF) and Threshold Decisions (TD), Diag-RAPS consistently achieves the lowest risk, while achieving the performance specification when it is feasible.</description>

      <title>Average Consensus over Directed Networks in Open Multi-Agent Systems with Acknowledgement Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed average consensus problem over directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where the stability of the network is disrupted by frequent agent arrivals and departures, leading to a time-varying average consensus target. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel ratio consensus algorithm (OPENRC) based on acknowledgement feedback, designed to be robust to agent arrivals and departures, as well as to unbalanced directed network topologies. We demonstrate that when all active agents execute the OPENRC algorithm, the sum of their state variables remains constant during quiescent epochs when the network remains unchanged. By assuming eventual convergence during such quiescent periods following persistent variations in system composition and size, we prove the convergence of the OPENRC algorithm using column-stochasticity and mass-preservation properties. Finally, we apply and evaluate our proposed algorithm in a simulated environment, where agents are departing from and arriving in the network to highlight its resilience against changes in the network size and topology.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Control of Second-Order Multi-vehicle Systems in Bearing-Persistently Exciting Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an observer-based formation tracking control approach for multi-vehicle systems with second-order motion dynamics, assuming that vehicles' relative or global position and velocity measurements are unavailable. It is assumed that all vehicles are equipped with sensors capable of sensing the bearings relative to neighboring vehicles and only one leader vehicle has access to its global position. Each vehicle estimates its absolute position and velocity using relative bearing measurements and the estimates of neighboring vehicles received over a communication network. A distributed observer-based controller is designed, relying only on bearing and acceleration measurements.
  This work further explores the concept of the \textit{Bearing Persistently Exciting} (BPE) formation by proposing new algorithms for bearing-based localization and state estimation of second-order systems in centralized and decentralized manners. It also examines conditions on the desired formation to guarantee the exponential stability of distributed observer-based formation tracking controllers. In support of our theoretical results, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed observers as well as the observer-based tracking controllers.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Feedback of Nonlinear Systems through the Efficient Solution of Min-Max Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine robust output feedback control of discrete-time nonlinear systems with bounded uncertainties affecting the dynamics and measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate how to construct semi-infinite programs that produce gains to minimize some desired performance cost over a finite prediction horizon for the worst-case realization of the system's uncertainties, while also ensuring that any specified nonlinear constraints are always satisfied. The solution process relies on an implicit description of the feasible state space through prior measurements and the system dynamics, and assumes that the system is always in the subset of the feasible space that is most detrimental to performance. In doing so, we can guarantee that the system's true state will meet all of the chosen performance criteria without resorting to any explicit state estimation. Under some smoothness assumptions, we also discuss solving these semi-infinite programs through local reduction techniques, which generate optimal scenario sets for the uncertainty realizations to approximate the continuous uncertainty space and speed up the computation of optima. When tested on a two-dimensional nonlinear quadrotor, the developed method achieves robust constraint satisfaction and tracking despite dealing with highly uncertain measurements and system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operation of a Building with Electricity-Heat Networks and Seasonal Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As seasonal thermal energy storage emerges as an efficient solution to reduce CO2 emissions of buildings, challenges appear related to its optimal operation. In a system including short-term electricity storage, long-term heat storage, and where electricity and heat networks are connected through a heat pump, it becomes crucial to operate the system on two time scales. Based on real data from a university building, we simulate the operation of such a system over a year, comparing different strategies based on model predictive control (MPC). The first objective of this paper is to determine the minimum prediction horizon to retrieve the results of the full-horizon operation problem with cost minimization. The second objective is to evaluate a method that combines MPC with setting targets on the heat storage level at the end of the prediction horizon, based on historical data. For a prediction horizon of 6 days, the suboptimality gap with the full-horizon results is 4.31%, compared to 11.42% when using a prediction horizon of 42 days and fixing the final level to be equal to the initial level, which is a common approach.</description>

      <title>Flight Testing of Latch Valve with Lightweight LV-Servo Direct Drive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08825v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of rocket technology, the latch valve assumes a pivotal role in regulating the flow of fuel gases and liquids to ensure the requisite energy supply. This project endeavors to innovate by replacing the conventional step motor mechanism with a servo motor for latch valve control. The selected servo motor, boasting a more compact form factor and reduced mass, aligns seamlessly with the project's overarching objectives. While servo motors offer myriad advantages, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the constraints of their maximum output torque to guarantee the latch valve's reliable operation. Furthermore, as a rocket ascends, it encounters significant fluctuations in internal temperature and pressure. Consequently, rigorous environmental testing becomes paramount to validate the servo motor's performance under these dynamic conditions, thus ensuring the latch valve's unwavering functionality. The primary focus of this project is the design and testing of the mechanism's performance in simulated rocket environments, achieved through the implementation of the servo motor for latch valve control. The results reveal that the servo motor demonstrated its effectiveness and reliability in controlling the latch valve under the rigorous environmental conditions of rocket flight.</description>

      <title>Thermal Modelling of Battery Cells for Optimal Tab and Surface Cooling Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal cooling that minimises thermal gradients and the average temperature is essential for enhanced battery safety and health. This work presents a new modelling approach for battery cells of different shapes by integrating Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin method and model component decomposition. As a result, a library of reduced-order computationally efficient battery thermal models is obtained, characterised by different numbers of states. These models are validated against a high-fidelity finite element model and are compared with a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) model under real-world vehicle driving and battery cooling scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed model with four states can faithfully capture the two-dimensional thermal dynamics, while the model with only one state significantly outperforms the widely-used two-state TEC model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing computation time by 28.7\%. Furthermore, our developed models allow for independent control of tab and surface cooling channels, enabling effective thermal performance optimisation. Additionally, the proposed model's versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated through various applications, including the evaluation of different cooling scenarios, closed-loop temperature control, and cell design optimisation.</description>

      <title>Structural Robustness and Vulnerability of Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are useful descriptions of the structure of many complex systems. Unsurprisingly, it is thus important to analyze the robustness of networks in many scientific disciplines. In applications in communication, logistics, finance, ecology, biomedicine, and many other fields, researchers have studied the robustness of networks to the removal of nodes, edges, or other subnetworks to identify and characterize robust network structures. A major challenge in the study of network robustness is that researchers have reported that different and seemingly contradictory network properties are correlated with a network's robustness. Using a framework by Alderson and Doyle~\cite{Alderson2010}, we categorize several notions of network robustness and we examine these ostensible contradictions. We survey studies of network robustness with a focus on (1)~identifying robustness specifications in common use, (2)~understanding when these specifications are appropriate, and (3)~understanding the conditions under which one can expect different notions of robustness to yield similar results. With this review, we aim to give researchers an overview of the large, interdisciplinary body of work on network robustness and develop practical guidance for the design of computational experiments to study a network's robustness.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Foot-Placement Control for Underactuated Humanoid Walking on Swaying Rigid Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locomotion on dynamic rigid surface (i.e., rigid surface accelerating in an inertial frame) presents complex challenges for controller design, which are essential for deploying humanoid robots in dynamic real-world environments such as moving trains, ships, and airplanes. This paper introduces a real-time, provably stabilizing control approach for underactuated humanoid walking on periodically swaying rigid surface. The first key contribution is the analytical extension of the classical angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model from static to swaying grounds. This extension results in a time-varying, nonhomogeneous robot model, which is fundamentally different from the existing pendulum models. We synthesize a discrete footstep control law for the model and derive a new set of sufficient stability conditions that verify the controller's stabilizing effect. Another key contribution is the development of a hierarchical control framework that incorporates the proposed footstep control law as its higher-layer planner to ensure the stability of underactuated walking. The closed-loop stability of the complete hybrid, full-order robot dynamics under this control framework is provably analyzed based on nonlinear control theory. Finally, experiments conducted on a Digit humanoid robot, both in simulations and with hardware, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in addressing underactuated bipedal locomotion on swaying ground, even in the presence of uncertain surface motions and unknown external pushes.</description>

      <title>Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though a variety of methods (e.g., RL, MPC, LQR) have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control of physical systems remains an open challenge. A promising avenue would be to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems. Furthermore, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it presses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, (iii) we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iv) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we leverage these four properties and show that they enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information.</description>

Abstract: As the global focus on combating environmental pollution intensifies, the transition to sustainable energy sources, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EVs), has become paramount. This paper addresses the pressing need for Smart Charging for EVs by developing a comprehensive mathematical model aimed at optimizing charging station management. The model aims to efficiently allocate the power from charging sockets to EVs, prioritizing cost minimization and avoiding energy waste. Computational simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the mathematical optimization model, which can unleash its full potential when the number of EVs at the charging station is high.</description>

      <title>Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focus on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with a output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental condition to decide constraints states for final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</description>

      <title>6G Fresnel Spot Beamfocusing using Large-Scale Metasurfaces: A Distributed DRL-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of spot beamfocusing (SBF) in the Fresnel zone through extremely large-scale programmable metasurfaces (ELPMs) as a key enabling technology for 6G networks. A smart SBF scheme aims to adaptively concentrate the aperture's radiating power exactly at a desired focal point (DFP) in the 3D space utilizing some Machine Learning (ML) method. This offers numerous advantages for next-generation networks including efficient wireless power transfer (WPT), interference mitigation, reduced RF pollution, and improved information security. SBF necessitates ELPMs with precise channel state information (CSI) for all ELPM elements. However, obtaining exact CSI for ELPMs is not feasible in all environments; we alleviate this by proposing an adaptive novel CSI-independent ML scheme based on the TD3 deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) method. While the proposed ML-based scheme is well-suited for relatively small-size arrays, the computational complexity is unaffordable for ELPMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a modular highly scalable structure composed of multiple sub-arrays, each equipped with a TD3-DRL optimizer. This setup enables collaborative optimization of the radiated power at the DFP, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing learning speed. The proposed structures benefits in terms of 3D spot-like power distribution, convergence rate, and scalability are validated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Flow Pursuit via Feedback-based Safe Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controlling inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution grid to solve an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem in real time. The AC OPF includes voltage constraints, and seeks to minimize costs associated with the economic operation, power losses, or the power curtailment from renewables. We develop an online feedback optimization method to drive the DERs' power setpoints to solutions of an AC OPF problem based only on voltage measurements (and without requiring measurements of the power consumption of non-controllable assets). The proposed method - grounded on the theory of control barrier functions - is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow, appropriately modified to accommodate measurements from the power network. We provide results in terms of local exponential stability, and assess the robustness to errors in the measurements and in the system Jacobian matrix. We show that the proposed method ensures anytime satisfaction of the voltage constraints when no model and measurement errors are present; if these errors are present and are small, the voltage violation is practically negligible. We also discuss extensions of the framework to virtual power plant setups and to cases where constraints on power flows and currents must be enforced. Numerical experiments on a 93-bus distribution system and with realistic load and production profiles show a superior performance in terms of voltage regulation relative to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Generalizations and variations of the fundamental lemma by Willems et al. are an active topic of recent research. In this note, we explore and formalize the links between kernel regression and some known nonlinear extensions of the fundamental lemma. Applying a transformation to the usual linear equation in Hankel matrices, we arrive at an alternative implicit kernel representation of the system trajectories while keeping the requirements on persistency of excitation. We show that this representation is equivalent to the solution of a specific kernel regression problem. We explore the possible structures of the underlying kernel as well as the system classes to which they correspond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter variations within the resonant network of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems can cause drift in the resonant frequency, leading to a detuned system that requires higher power capacity and experiences reduced transfer efficiency. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive online receiver resonant frequency tracking scheme based solely on primary-side detection. The proposed method effectively compensates for parameter fluctuations in both primary and secondary resonators. The core of this approach is a switch-controlled capacitor (SCC) with a control angle calibrated during a system self-check process prior to high-power charging. Additionally, a two-step perturb-and-observe algorithm has been developed to perform online tracking while minimizing disturbances to the output power. Post-tracking, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions can be achieved within a specified detuning range. To validate the efficacy of the proposed system, a 200W experimental platform was constructed. The measured results demonstrate that resonance is consistently maintained within the 79-90 kHz frequency range, as specified by the SAE J2954 standard. The maximum frequency tracking error and efficiency increase are 0.7 kHz and 9%, respectively. Notably, the tracking process is completed in less than 1 ms.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the domain of validity for Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction</title>

Abstract: Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction is a dimensionality reduction technique in nonlinear systems analysis that is commonly utilised in the study of bifurcation problems in high-dimensional systems. The method is a systematic procedure for reducing the dimensionality of systems of algebraic equations that have singular points, preserving essential features of their solution sets. In this article, we establish estimates for the region of validity of the reduction by leveraging recently derived bounds on the Implicit Function Theorem. We then apply these bounds to an illustrative example of a two-dimensional system with a pitchfork bifurcation.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <title>Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) is a data-driven control algorithm that utilizes data matrices to form a non-parametric representation of the underlying system, predicting future behaviors and generating optimal control actions. DeePC typically requires solving an online optimization problem, the complexity of which is heavily influenced by the amount of data used, potentially leading to expensive online computation. In this paper, we leverage deep learning to propose a highly computationally efficient DeePC approach for general nonlinear processes, referred to as Deep DeePC. Specifically, a deep neural network is employed to learn the DeePC vector operator, which is an essential component of the non-parametric representation of DeePC. This neural network is trained offline using historical open-loop input and output data of the nonlinear process. With the trained neural network, the Deep DeePC framework is formed for online control implementation. At each sampling instant, this neural network directly outputs the DeePC operator, eliminating the need for online optimization as conventional DeePC. The optimal control action is obtained based on the DeePC operator updated by the trained neural network. To address constrained scenarios, a constraint handling scheme is further proposed and integrated with the Deep DeePC to handle hard constraints during online implementation. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed Deep DeePC approach are demonstrated using two benchmark process examples.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically safe controllers based on control barrier functions and scenario model predictive control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer an efficient framework for designing real-time safe controllers. However, CBF-based controllers can be short-sighted, resulting in poor performance, a behaviour which is aggravated in uncertain conditions. This motivated research on safety filters based on model predictive control (MPC) and its stochastic variant. MPC deals with safety constraints in a direct manner, however, its computational demands grow with the prediction horizon length. We propose a safety formulation that solves a finite horizon optimization problem at each time instance like MPC, but rather than explicitly imposing constraints along the prediction horizon, we enforce probabilistic safety constraints by means of CBFs only at the first step of the horizon. The probabilistic CBF constraints are transformed in a finite number of deterministic CBF constraints via the scenario based methodology. Capitalizing on results on scenario based MPC, we provide distribution-free, \emph{a priori} guarantees on the system's closed loop expected safety violation frequency. We demonstrate our results through a case study on unmanned aerial vehicle collision-free position swapping, and provide a numerical comparison with recent stochastic CBF formulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Communities from Equilibria of Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies community detection for a nonlinear opinion dynamics model from its equilibria. It is assumed that the underlying network is generated from a stochastic block model with two communities, where agents are assigned with community labels and edges are added independently based on these labels. Agents update their opinions following a nonlinear rule that incorporates saturation effects on interactions. It is shown that clustering based on a single equilibrium can detect most community labels (i.e., achieving almost exact recovery), if the two communities differ in size and link probabilities. When the two communities are identical in size and link probabilities, and the inter-community connections are denser than intra-community ones, the algorithm can achieve almost exact recovery under negative influence weights but fails under positive influence weights. Utilizing fixed point equations and spectral methods, we also propose a detection algorithm based on multiple equilibria, which can detect communities with positive influence weights. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Disinfectant Control in Drinking Water Networks: Integrating Advection-Dispersion-Reaction Models and Byproduct Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective disinfection is essential for maintaining water quality standards in distribution networks. Chlorination, as the most used technique, ensures safe water by maintaining sufficient chlorine residuals but also leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). These DBPs pose health risks, highlighting the need for chlorine injection control (CIC) by booster stations to balance safety and DBPs formation. Prior studies have followed various approaches to address this research problem. However, most of these studies overlook the changing flow conditions and their influence on the evolution of the chlorine and DBPs concentrations by integrating simplified transport-reaction models into CIC. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel CIC method that: (i) integrates multi-species dynamics, (ii) allows for a more accurate representation of the reaction dynamics of chlorine, other substances, and the resulting DBPs formation, and (iii) optimizes for the regulation of chlorine concentrations subject to EPA mandates thereby mitigating network-wide DBPs formation. The novelty of this study lies in its incorporation of time-dependent controllability analysis that captures the control coverage of each booster station. The effectiveness of the proposed CIC method is demonstrated through its application and validation via numerical case studies on different water networks with varying scales, initial conditions, and parameters.</description>

      <title>Improving Initial Transients of Online Learning Echo State Network Control System with Feedback Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) have become increasingly popular in online learning control systems due to their ease of training. However, online learning ESN controllers often suffer from slow convergence during the initial transient phase. Existing solutions, such as prior training, control mode switching, and incorporating plant dynamic approximations, have notable drawbacks, including undermining the system's online learning property or relying on prior knowledge of the controlled system. This work proposes a simple yet effective approach to address the slow initial convergence of online learning ESN control systems by integrating a feedback proportional-derivative (P-D) controller. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control system achieves rapid convergence during the initial transient phase and shows strong robustness against changes in the controlled system's dynamics and variations in the online learning model's hyperparameters. We show that the feedback controller accelerates convergence by guiding the online learning ESN to operate within a data range well-suited for learning. This study offers practical benefits for engineers aiming to implement online learning ESN control systems with fast convergence and easy deployment.</description>

      <title>Online Actuator Selection and Controller Design for Linear Quadratic Regulation with Unknown System Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the simultaneous actuator selection and controller design problem for linear quadratic regulation with Gaussian noise over a finite horizon of length $T$ and unknown system model. We consider both episodic and non-episodic settings of the problem and propose online algorithms that specify both the sets of actuators to be utilized under a cardinality constraint and the controls corresponding to the sets of selected actuators. In the episodic setting, the interaction with the system breaks into $N$ episodes, each of which restarts from a given initial condition and has length $T$. In the non-episodic setting, the interaction goes on continuously. Our online algorithms leverage a multiarmed bandit algorithm to select the sets of actuators and a certainty equivalence approach to design the corresponding controls. We show that our online algorithms yield $\sqrt{N}$-regret for the episodic setting and $T^{2/3}$-regret for the non-episodic setting. We extend our algorithm design and analysis to show scalability with respect to both the total number of candidate actuators and the cardinality constraint. We numerically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Passivity-Based Method for Accelerated Convex Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a constructive methodology for designing accelerated convex optimisation algorithms in continuous-time domain. The two key enablers are the classical concept of passivity in control theory and the time-dependent change of variables that maps the output of the internal dynamic system to the optimisation variables. The Lyapunov function associated with the optimisation dynamics is obtained as a natural consequence of specifying the internal dynamics that drives the state evolution as a passive linear time-invariant system. The passivity-based methodology provides a general framework that has the flexibility to generate convex optimisation algorithms with the guarantee of different convergence rate bounds on the objective function value. The same principle applies to the design of online parameter update algorithms for adaptive control by re-defining the output of internal dynamics to allow for the feedback interconnection with tracking error dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Center-of-Mass Displacement in Aerial Manipulation: An Innovative Platform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerial manipulators are increasingly used in contact-based industrial applications, where tasks like drilling and pushing require platforms to exert significant forces in multiple directions. To enhance force generation capabilities, various approaches, such as thrust vectoring and perching, have been explored. In this article, we introduce a novel approach by investigating the impact of varied CoM (Center of Mass) locations on an aerial manipulation system's force exertion. Our proposed platform features a design with a dynamically displacing CoM, enabling a smooth transition between free flight and high-force interactions supported by tilting back rotors. We provide detailed modeling and control strategies for this design and validate its feasibility through a series of physical experiments. In a pushing task, the proposed system, weighing 3.12kg, was able to stably exert over 28N of force on a work surface-nearly equivalent to its gravitational force-achieved solely through the tilting of its back rotors. Additionally, we introduce a new factor to evaluate the force generation capabilities of aerial platforms, allowing for a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art systems, which demonstrates the advantages of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the design of sparse actuator schedules for linear time-invariant systems. An actuator schedule selects, for each time instant, which control inputs act on the system in that instant. We address the optimal scheduling of control inputs under a hard constraint on the number of inputs that can be used at each time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based randomized optimization</description>
