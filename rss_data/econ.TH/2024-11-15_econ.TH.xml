      <title>A Strategic Topology on Information Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two information structures are said to be close if, with high probability, there is approximate common knowledge that interim beliefs are close under the two information structures. We define an "almost common knowledge topology" reflecting this notion of closeness. We show that it is the coarsest topology generating continuity of equilibrium outcomes. An information structure is said to be simple if each player has a finite set of types and each type has a distinct first-order belief about payoff states. We show that simple information structures are dense in the almost common knowledge topology and thus it is without loss to restrict attention to simple information structures in information design problems.</description>

      <title>Informational Puts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully characterize how dynamic information should be provided to uniquely implement the largest equilibrium in dynamic binary-action supermodular games. The designer offers an informational put: she stays silent in good times, but injects asymmetric and inconclusive public information if players lose faith. There is (i) no multiplicity gap: the largest (partially) implementable equilibrium can be implemented uniquely; and (ii) no intertemporal commitment gap: the policy is sequentially optimal. Our results have sharp implications for the design of policy in coordination environments.</description>

      <title>Randomized Truthful Auctions with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a setting where agents use no-regret learning algorithms to participate in repeated auctions. \citet{kolumbus2022auctions} showed, rather surprisingly, that when bidders participate in second-price auctions using no-regret bidding algorithms, no matter how large the number of interactions $T$ is, the runner-up bidder may not converge to bidding truthfully. Our first result shows that this holds for \emph{general deterministic} truthful auctions. We also show that the ratio of the learning rates of the bidders can \emph{qualitatively} affect the convergence of the bidders. Next, we consider the problem of revenue maximization in this environment. In the setting with fully rational bidders, \citet{myerson1981optimal} showed that revenue can be maximized by using a second-price auction with reserves.We show that, in stark contrast, in our setting with learning bidders, \emph{randomized} auctions can have strictly better revenue guarantees than second-price auctions with reserves, when $T$ is large enough. Finally, we study revenue maximization in the non-asymptotic regime. We define a notion of {\em auctioneer regret} comparing the revenue generated to the revenue of a second price auction with truthful bids. When the auctioneer has to use the same auction throughout the interaction, we show an (almost) tight regret bound of $\smash{\widetilde \Theta(T^{3/4})}.$ If the auctioneer can change auctions during the interaction, but in a way that is oblivious to the bids, we show an (almost) tight bound of $\smash{\widetilde \Theta(\sqrt{T})}.$</description>
