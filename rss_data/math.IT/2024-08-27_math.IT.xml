      <title>Low-Complexity Coding Techniques for Cloud Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of coding for the uplink and downlink of cloud radio access networks (C-RAN's) with $K$ users and $L$ relays is considered. It is shown that low-complexity coding schemes that achieve any point in the rate-fronthaul region of joint coding and compression can be constructed starting from at most $4(K+L)-2$ point-to-point codes designed for symmetric channels. This reduces the seemingly hard task of constructing good codes for C-RAN's to the much better understood task of finding good codes for single-user channels. To show this result, an equivalence between the achievable rate-fronthaul regions of joint coding and successive coding is established. Then, rate-splitting and quantization-splitting techniques are used to show that the task of achieving a rate-fronthaul point in the joint coding region can be simplified to that of achieving a corner point in a higher-dimensional C-RAN problem. As a by-product, some interesting properties of the rate-fronthaul region of joint decoding for uplink C-RAN's are also derived.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Multiple Access with Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the unprecedented mobile traffic demands of future wireless networks, a paradigm shift from conventional cellular networks to distributed communication systems is imperative. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) represents a practical and scalable embodiment of distributed/network MIMO systems. It inherits not only the key benefits of co-located massive MIMO systems but also the macro-diversity gains from distributed systems. This innovative architecture has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing network performance from various perspectives, outperforming co-located mMIMO and conventional small-cell systems. Moreover, CF-mMIMO offers flexibility in integration with emerging wireless technologies such as full-duplex (FD), non-orthogonal transmission schemes, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided communication, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we provide an overview of current research efforts on CF-mMIMO systems and their promising future application scenarios. We then elaborate on new requirements for CF-mMIMO networks in the context of these technological breakthroughs. We also present several current open challenges and outline future research directions aimed at fully realizing the potential of CF mMIMO systems in meeting the evolving demands of future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Continuous Optimization for Decoding Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes are one of the most fundamental objects in pseudorandomness, with applications in communication, complexity theory, and beyond. Codes are useful because of their ability to support decoding, which is the task of recovering a codeword from its noisy copy. List decoding is a relaxation where the decoder is allowed to output a list of codewords, and has seen tremendous progress over the last 25 years. In this thesis, we prove new algorithmic and combinatorial results about list decoding.
  We describe a list decoding framework that reduces the task of efficient decoding to proving distance in certain restricted proof systems. We then instantiate this framework for Tanner codes of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] and Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) distance amplification [FOCS 1995] of unique decodable base codes to get the first polynomial time list decoding algorithms for these codes. We also show extensions to the quantum version of AEL distance amplification to get polynomial-time list decodable quantum LDPC codes.
  We next give an alternate viewpoint of the above framework based on abstract regularity lemmas. We show how to efficiently implement the regularity lemma for the case of Ta-Shma's explicit codes near the Gilbert-Varshamov bound [STOC 2017]. This leads to a near-linear time algorithm for unique decoding of Ta-Shma's code.
  We also give new combinatorial results that improve known list sizes beyond the Johnson bound. Firstly, we adapt the AEL amplification to construct a new family of explicit codes that can be combinatorially list decoded to the optimal error correction radius. This is the first example of such a code that does not use significant algebraic ingredients. Secondly, we present list size improvements for Folded Reed-Solomon codes, improving the state of the art list size for explicit list decoding capacity achieving codes.</description>

      <title>The period of $x^h + x + 1$ over GF(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periods of polynomials can be used to characterize discrete structures such as algebraic error control codes and feedback shift registers. We study trinomial $x^h+x+1$ over GF(2), which has the maximum number of consecutive zero coefficients and leads to efficient implementation. Existing results typically deal with finite values of $h$ and rely on computer computation methods for finding the periods. In contrast, here we derive closed-form expressions for the periods of this trinomial for infinite sets of $h$ values.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of RIS-Aided Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of emerging fluid antenna systems (FAS) on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided secure communications. Specifically, we consider a classic wiretap channel, where a fixed-antenna transmitter sends confidential information to an FAS-equipped legitimate user with the help of an RIS, while an FAS-equipped eavesdropper attempts to decode the message. To evaluate the proposed wireless scenario, we first introduce the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each node, using the central limit theorem and the Gaussian copula function. We then derive a compact analytical expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Our numerical results reveal how the incorporation of FAS and RIS can significantly enhance the performance of secure communications.</description>

      <title>Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint that belongs to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize the optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to the presence of implicit equations in the structure of the iteration. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal iteration solution, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on a relaxation of the OAM iterates. Both schemes are shown, via the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions, to guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and the perception constraints which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and draw connections with existing results.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, we formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) was equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP and PNG via an LZ grammar. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the previously proven result that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on a misleading experiment. When the experiment is conducted properly the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident, and aligns with the mathematical proof previously provided. This completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of repetitions to arrive at a measure for life, is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse argument' does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their primary empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, not by any special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special subcase of our Block Decomposition Method introduced almost a decade earlier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing number of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, prognosis models have the potential to aid in early disease detection. However, current approaches raise dependability concerns as they do not account for uncertainty. In this work, we compare the performance of Monte Carlo Dropout, Variational Inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Ensemble Learning trained on 512 patients to predict 4-year cognitive score trajectories with confidence bounds. We show that MC Dropout and MCMC are able to produce well-calibrated, and accurate predictions under noisy training data.</description>

Abstract: We propose a measure of learning efficiency for non-finite state spaces. We characterize the complexity of a learning problem by the metric entropy of its state space. We then describe how learning efficiency is determined by this measure of complexity. This is, then, applied to two models where agents learn high-dimensional states.</description>

      <title>Measuring publication relatedness using controlled vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications has important applications in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness because they address issues that arise when using citation or textual similarity to measure relatedness. While several controlled-vocabulary-based relatedness measures have been developed, there exists no comprehensive and direct test of their accuracy and suitability for different types of research questions. This paper reviews existing measures, develops a new measure, and benchmarks the measures using TREC Genomics data as a ground truth of topics. The benchmark test show that the new measure and the measure proposed by Ahlgren et al. (2020) have differing strengths and weaknesses. These results inform a discussion of which method to choose when studying interdisciplinarity, information retrieval, clustering of science, and researcher topic switching.</description>

      <title>On the Encoding Process in Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of encoding information in a system of N=K+R processors that operate in a decentralized manner, i.e., without a central processor which orchestrates the operation. The system involves K source processors, each holding some data modeled as a vector over a finite field. The remaining R processors are sinks, and each of which requires a linear combination of all data vectors. These linear combinations are distinct from one sink processor to another, and are specified by a generator matrix of a systematic linear error correcting code. To capture the communication cost of decentralized encoding, we adopt a linear network model in which the process proceeds in consecutive communication rounds. In every round, every processor sends and receives one message through each one of its p ports. Moreover, inspired by linear network coding literature, we allow processors to transfer linear combinations of their own data and previously received data. We propose a framework that addresses the decentralized encoding problem on two levels. On the universal level, we provide a solution to the decentralized encoding problem for any possible linear code. On the specific level, we further optimize our solution towards systematic Reed-Solomon codes, as well as their variant, Lagrange codes, for their prevalent use in coded storage and computation systems. Our solutions are based on a newly-defined collective communication operation we call all-to-all encode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) a tighter continuity relation for quantum capacity; (4) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (5) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (6) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (7) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>

      <title>SBMA: A Multiple Access Scheme with High Diversity and Multiplexing Gains for Next-gen Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies advanced multi-access techniques to support high volumes of concurrent access in wireless networks. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), as a code-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), serves multiple users simultaneously by adopting frequency-domain coding. Blind Interference Alignment, in contrast, applies time-domain coding to accommodate multiple users. Unlike beamforming, both of them need no Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), which saves control overheads on channel information feedback. To further increase multiplexing gain and diversity order, we propose a new multiple access framework, which utilizes both time and frequency coding by combining SCMA and BIA, which is SBMA (Sparsecode-and-BIA-based multiple access). Two decoding schemes, namely the two-stage decoding scheme consisting of zero-forcing and Message Passing Algorithm (MPA), and the Joint Message Passing Algorithm (JMPA) enhanced by constructing a virtual factor graph, have been analyzed. Simulation results indicate that although the performance of the two-stage decoding scheme is inferior to both BIA and SCMA, it has a relatively low decoding complexity. Nonetheless, the JMPA decoding scheme achieves the same diversity gain as an STBC-based SCMA and with an even higher multiplexing gain, which makes the SBMA with JMPA decoding scheme a promising MA scheme for next-gen wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Extremal Mechanisms for Pointwise Maximal Leakage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data publishing under privacy constraints can be achieved with mechanisms that add randomness to data points when released to an untrusted party, thereby decreasing the data's utility. In this paper, we analyze this privacy-utility tradeoff for the pointwise maximal leakage privacy measure and a general class of convex utility functions. Pointwise maximal leakage (PML) was recently proposed as an operationally meaningful privacy measure based on two equivalent threat models: An adversary guessing a randomized function and an adversary aiming to maximize a general gain function. We study the behavior of the randomized response mechanism designed for local differential privacy under different prior distributions of the private data. Motivated by the findings of this analysis, we derive several closed-form solutions for the optimal privacy-utility tradeoff in the presented PML context using tools from convex analysis. Finally, we present a linear program that can compute optimal mechanisms for PML in a general setting.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates covert communications in an integrated sensing and communications system, where a dual-functional base station (called Alice) covertly transmits signals to a covert user (called Bob) while sensing multiple targets, with one of them acting as a potential watcher (called Willie) and maliciously eavesdropping on legitimate communications. To shelter the covert communications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise (DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal reception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based on this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square error (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert communication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement. The robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and statistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively adjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in the closed-form expression. The formulated covertness constrained optimization problems are tackled by a feasibility-checking based difference-of-convex relaxation (DC) algorithm utilizing the S-procedure, Bernstein-type inequality, and the DC method. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the covertness performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Successive Interference Cancellation for Non-Linear Bandlimited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable communication over bandlimited and non-linear channels usually requires equalization to simplify receiver processing. Equalizers that perform joint detection and decoding (JDD) achieve the highest information rates but are often too complex to implement. To address this challenge, model-based neural network (NN) equalizers that perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) are shown to approach JDD information rates for bandlimited channels with a memoryless nonlinearity and additive white Gaussian noise. The NNs are chosen to have a periodically time-varying and recurrent structure that imitates the forward-backward algorithm (FBA) in every SIC stage. Simulations for short-haul fiber-optic links with square-law detection show that NN-SIC nearly doubles current spectral efficiencies, and bipolar or complex-valued modulations achieve energy gains of up to 3dB compared to state-of-the-art intensity modulation. Moreover, NN-SIC is considerably less complex than equalizers that perform JDD, mismatched FBA processing, and Gibbs sampling.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems in High-Mobility Scenarios: Instantaneous Model or Statistical Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical linear statistical models, like the first-order auto-regressive (AR) model, are commonly used as channel model in high-mobility scenarios. However, compared to sub-6G, the effect of Doppler frequency shifts is more significant at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, and the effectiveness of the statistical channel model in high-mobility mmWave scenarios should be reconsidered. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output-(MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in high-mobility scenarios, with the focus on the comparison between the instantaneous channel model and the statistical channel model. For the instantaneous model, by leveraging the low-rank nature of mmWave channels and the multidimensional characteristics of MIMO-OFDM signals across space, time, and frequency, the received signals are structured as a fourth-order tensor fitting a low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. Then, to solve the CP decomposition problem, an estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT)-type decomposition based channel estimation method is proposed by exploring the Vandermonde structure of factor matrix, and the channel parameters are then estimated from the factor matrices. We analyze the uniqueness condition of the CP decomposition and develop a concise derivation of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for channel parameters. Simulations show that our method outperforms the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the results based on the wireless environment generated by Wireless InSite verify that the channel estimation based on the instantaneous channel model performs better than that based on the statistical channel model. Therefore, the instantaneous channel model is recommended for designing channel estimation algorithm for mmWave systems in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 77%.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ordered Statistics Decoding of Short LDPC Codes with Simple Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered statistics decoding has been instrumental in tackling decoding failures that remain after normalized min-sum decoding in short low-density parity-check codes. Despite its benefits, the high complexity associated with effective ordered statistics decoding has restricted its application in demanding scenarios. To overcome this limitation, a novel variant of the ordered statistics decoder is proposed. This approach is initiated by the design of a neural network model that refines the measurement of codeword bits, utilizing iterative information gleaned from normalized min-sum decoding failures. Subsequently, a fixed decoding path is established, comprising a sequence of blocks, each featuring a variety of test error patterns. The introduction of a sliding window-assisted neural model facilitates early termination of the ordered statistics decoding process along this path, with a focus on enhancing the balance between performance and complexity. Comprehensive simulations and complexity analysis have demonstrated that the proposed hybrid method is on par with state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics, particularly showing a significant advantage in reducing time latency.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits for Jammer-Resilient Communication in Finite-Resolution MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a powerful method for jammer mitigation. In principle, a MIMO receiver can null the interference of a single-antenna jammer at the cost of only one degree of freedom - if the number of receive antennas is large, communication performance is barely affected. In this paper, we show that the potential for MIMO jammer mitigation based on the digital outputs of finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is fundamentally worse: Strong jammers will either cause the ADCs to saturate (when the ADCs' quantization range is small) or drown legitimate communication signals in quantization noise (when the ADCs' quantization range is large). We provide a fundamental bound on the mutual information between the quantized receive signal and the legitimate transmit signal. Our bound shows that, for any fixed ADC resolution, the mutual information tends to zero as the jammer power tends to infinity, regardless of the quantization strategy. Our bound also confirms the intuition that for every 6.02 dB increase in jamming power, the ADC resolution must be increased by 1 bit in order to prevent the mutual information from vanishing.</description>

      <title>Local Mutual-Information Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local mutual-information privacy (LMIP) is a privacy notion that aims to quantify the reduction of uncertainty about the input data when the output of a privacy-preserving mechanism is revealed. We study the relation of LMIP with local differential privacy (LDP), the de facto standard notion of privacy in context-independent (CI) scenarios, and with local information privacy (LIP), the state-of-the-art notion for context-dependent settings. We establish explicit conversion rules, i.e., bounds on the privacy parameters for an LMIP mechanism to also satisfy LDP/LIP, and vice versa. We use our bounds to formally verify that LMIP is a weak privacy notion. We also show that uncorrelated Gaussian noise is the best-case noise in terms of CI-LMIP if both the input data and the noise are subject to an average power constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the shadow codes of Cherubini and Micheli to include basic polynomials having arbitrary degree, and show that restricting basic polynomials to have degree one or less can result in improved lower bounds on the minimum distance of the code. However, even these improved lower bounds suggest that shadow codes have considerably inferior distance-rate characteristics compared with the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code and a first-order Reed-Muller inner code.</description>
