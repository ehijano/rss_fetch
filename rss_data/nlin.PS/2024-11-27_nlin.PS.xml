      <title>Oscillatory instability and stability of stationary solutions in the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found two stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear term proportional to $|\psi(x,t)|^{2 \kappa} \psi(x,t)$ for positive values of $\kappa$. By linearizing the equation around these exact solutions, we derive the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problem. Our analysis reveals that one of the stationary solutions is unstable, while the stability of the other solution depends on the amplitude of the parametric force, damping coefficient, and nonlinearity parameter $\kappa$. An exceptional change of variables facilitates the computation of the stability diagram through numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem as a specific parameter $\varepsilon$ varies within a bounded interval. For $\kappa &lt;2$ , an {\it oscillatory instability} is predicted analytically and confirmed numerically. Our principal result establishes that for $\kappa \ge 2$, there exists a critical value of $\varepsilon$ beyond which the unstable soliton becomes stable, exhibiting {\it oscillatory stability}.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Concentric-ring patterns of higher-order lumps in the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-time patterns of general higher-order lump solutions in the KP-I equation are investigated. It is shown that when the index vector of the general lump solution is a sequence of consecutive odd integers starting from one, the large-time pattern in the spatial $(x, y)$ plane generically would comprise fundamental lumps uniformly distributed on concentric rings. For other index vectors, the large-time pattern would comprise fundamental lumps in the outer region as described analytically by the nonzero-root structure of the associated Wronskian-Hermit polynomial, together with possible fundamental lumps in the inner region that are uniformly distributed on concentric rings generically. Leading-order predictions of fundamental lumps in these solution patterns are also derived. The predicted patterns at large times are compared to true solutions, and good agreement is observed.</description>

      <title>Predicting effective quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching -- the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence -- for localized pulse solutions in models of excitable media. The theory accounts for an additional equivariance compared to the homogeneous ignition problem, and thus requires a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess their accuracy for several models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of continuing a scalar root, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. In its $1+1$-dimensional reduction corresponding to the case without external forces, we further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>
