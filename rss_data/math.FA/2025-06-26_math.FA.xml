      <title>Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals for Operators with Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs) have played a foundational role in operator theory and functional calculus, particularly for analyzing Hermitian matrices via spectral decomposition. Conventional MOIs rely on the assumption of self-adjointness, making them analytically tractable for computing Frechet derivatives, establishing trace formulas, and deriving commutator estimates. However, many problems in mathematics, science, and engineering involve matrices that are fundamentally non-Hermitian, arising in contexts such as numerical discretization of differential operators, signal processing, control systems, and non-Hermitian physics. These cases necessitate a more general framework for operator integration. In this paper, we propose and develop the theory of Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals (GMOIs), which extends MOI techniques to arbitrary matrices, including non-Hermitian and non-normal cases. We unify conventional MOIs under the perspective of the Spectral Mapping Theorem and present a rigorous construction of Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs) in finite-dimensional setting via Jordan decomposition of any matrix. We establish key algebraic properties, derive norm estimates, and prove continuity and Lipschitz-type perturbation formulas. Finally, we demonstrate how GMOIs can be used to compute matrix function derivatives in non-Hermitian environments, thus significantly broadening the applicability of MOI-based methods in both theoretical and practical domains.</description>

      <title>A matrix-valued measure associated to the derivatives of a function of generalised bounded deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate to every function $u\in GBD(\Omega)$ a measure $\mu_u$ with values in the space of symmetric matrices, which generalises the distributional symmetric gradient $Eu$ defined for functions of bounded deformation. We show that this measure $\mu_u$ admits a decomposition as the sum of three mutually singular matrix-valued measures $\mu^a_u$, $\mu^c_u$, and $\mu^j_u$, the absolutely continuous part, the Cantor part, and the jump part, as in the case of $BD(\Omega)$ functions. We then characterise the space $GSBD(\Omega)$, originally defined only by slicing, as the space of functions $u\in GBD(\Omega)$ such that $\mu^c_u=0$.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-type spaces of the unit bidisc and toral completely hyperexpansive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a notion, originally introduced by Aleman in one variable, of Dirichlet-type space $\mathcal D(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ on the unit bidisc $\mathbb D^2,$ with superharmonic weights related to finite positive Borel measures $\mu_1,\mu_2$ on $\overline{\mathbb D}.$ The multiplication operators $\mathscr M_{z_1}$ and $\mathscr M_{z_2}$ by the coordinate functions $z_1$ and $z_2,$ respectively, are bounded on $\mathcal D(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ and the set of polynomials is dense in $\mathcal D(\mu_1,\mu_2).$ We show that the commuting pair $\mathscr M_{z}=(\mathscr M_{z_1},\mathscr M_{z_2})$ is a cyclic analytic toral completely hyperexpansive $2$-tuple on $\mathcal D(\mu_1,\mu_2).$ Unlike the one variable case, not all cyclic analytic toral completely hyperexpansive pairs arise as multiplication $2$-tuple $\mathscr M_z$ on these spaces. In particular, we establish that a cyclic analytic toral completely hyperexpansive operator $2$-tuple $T=(T_1,T_2)$ satisfying $I-T^*_1 T_1-T^*_2T_2+T^*_1T^*_2T_1T_2=0$ and having a cyclic vector $f_0$ is unitarily equivalent to $\mathscr{M}_z$ on $\mathcal{D}(\mu_1, \mu_2)$ for some finite positive Borel measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ on $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ if and only if $\ker T^*$, spanned by $f_0$, is a wandering subspace for $T$.</description>

      <title>On gradient descent-ascent flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) flows play a central role in finding saddle points of bivariate functionals, with applications in optimization, game theory, and robust control. While they are well-understood in Hilbert and Banach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general metric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the product of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a system of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed functional $\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on $\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a novel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric spaces. We establish a $\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative error estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects analogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay bound for the Nikaid\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on Wasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time and the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique saddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals. Our framework unifies and extends existing analyses, offering a metric-geometric perspective on GDA dynamics in nonlinear and non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Gamma-convergence of nonlocal energies for partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that certain nonlocal functionals defined on partitions made of measurable sets Gamma-converge to a local functional modeled on the perimeter in the sense of De Giorgi. Those nonlocal functionals involve generalized surface tension coefficients, and are lower semicontinuous even if the coefficients do not satisfy the triangular inequality. It implies a relaxation process in the limit, and provides a novel effect compare to the known gamma-convergence of the fractional perimeter towards the standard perimeter.</description>

      <title>On Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev estimates for degenerate Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish norm inequalities for fractional powers of degenerate Laplacians, with degeneracy being determined by weights in the Muckenhoupt class $A_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, accompanied by specific additional reverse H\"older assumptions. This extends the known results for classical Riesz potentials. The approach is based on size estimates for the degenerate heat kernels. The approach also applies to more general weighted degenerate operators.</description>

      <title>On Mahler's conjecture for even s-concave functions in dimensions 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish different sharp forms of Mahler's conjecture for $s$-concave even functions in dimensions $n$, for $n=1$ and $2$, for $s&gt;-1/n$, thus generalizing our previous results in \cite{FN} on log-concave even functions in dimension 2, which corresponds to the case $s=0$. The functional volume product of an even $s$-concave function $g$ is \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}g(x)dx\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\mathcal{L}_{s}g(y)dy, \] where $\mathcal{L}_{s}g$ is the $s$-polar function associated to $g$. The analogue of Mahler's conjecture for even $s$-concave functions postulates that this quantity is minimized for the indicatrix of a cube for any $s&gt;-1/n$. In dimension $n=1$, we prove this conjecture for all $s\in(-1,0)$ (the case $s\ge0$ was established by the first author and Mathieu Meyer in \cite[page 17]{FM10}). In dimension $n=2$, we only consider the case $1/s\in\mathbb{Z}$: for $s&gt;0$, we establish Mahler's conjecture for general $s$-concave even functions; for $s&lt;0$, the situation is more involved, we only prove a sharp inequality for $s$-concave functions $g$ such that $g^s$ admits an asymptote in every direction. Notice that this set of functions is quite natural to consider, when $s&lt;0$, since it is the largest subset of $s$-concave functions stable by $s$-duality.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Complexity of Radon transforms and the hybrid functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms may imply the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. Meanwhile, in the standard theory of generalized functions, if the origin function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule the complexity of Radon transform becomes in question. In the letter, we demonstrate that the Fourier method together with the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensure naturally the corresponding complexity. In its turn, this complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented method can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>
