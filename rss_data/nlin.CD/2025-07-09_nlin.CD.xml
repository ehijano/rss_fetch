      <title>PINNs Study for the Bekki-Nozaki Chaos in the Non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study chaotic behavior in the forced dissipative non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so called the Bekki-Nozaki equation. Chaotic systems are often seen in a strong sensitivity to initial conditions,leading to error accumulation over time when traditional numerical methods are applied. To address this difficulty, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs), a mesh-free deep learning framework. PINNs mitigate error accumulation in chaotic systems by solving partial differential equations without discretizing the computational domain. We demonstrate that PINNs successfully reproduce chaotic behavior of the Bekki-Nozaki equation. The results of the inverse analysis indicate a correlation between the governing equation's predictability and its chaotic nature of the solution.</description>

      <title>Minimal Deterministic Echo State Networks Outperform Random Reservoirs in Learning Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs. Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-Wave Resonance in Classical Lattices: Quasi-Resonances, Not Exact Resonance, Govern Energy Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for understanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical evolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we reveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive symmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between counter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization disrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We further demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not exact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward thermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with increasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact resonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance strength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide additional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating the size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>
