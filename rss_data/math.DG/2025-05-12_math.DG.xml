      <title>On electrostatic manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static manifolds with boundary were recently introduced by Cruz and Vit\'orio in the context of the prescribed scalar curvature problem in a manifold with boundary with prescribed mean curvature. This kind of manifold is also interesting from the point of view of the general theory of relativity. In this article, we introduce electrostatic manifolds with boundary as a natural generalization of static manifolds with boundary in the presence of a non-zero electric field. We study the geometry of the zero-level set of the potential and its connection to the global properties of electrostatic manifolds with boundary. In particular, we establish some rigidity theorems for the 3-dimensional Euclidean ball and for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om manifold.</description>

      <title>Conformal Fractional Dirac Operator and Spinorial Q-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the conformal fractional Dirac operator and its associated fractional spinorial Yamabe problem. We also present a Caffarelli-Silvestre type extension for this fractional operator, allowing us to express it as a Dirichlet-to-Neumann type operator. As a consequence, we exhibit energy inequalities associated to this operator along with a weighted type Sobolev inequality for spinors. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the critical operator (which can be local or non-local depending on the evenness of the dimension). We introduce a Q-curvature operator, acting on spinors generalizing the classical notion of the scalar Q-curvature.</description>

      <title>GEORCE: A Fast New Control Algorithm for Computing Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing geodesics for Riemannian manifolds is a difficult task that often relies on numerical approximations. However, these approximations tend to be either numerically unstable, have slow convergence, or scale poorly with manifold dimension and number of grid points. We introduce a new algorithm called GEORCE that computes geodesics via a transformation into a discrete control problem. We show that GEORCE has global convergence and quadratic local convergence. In addition, we show that it extends to Finsler manifolds. For both Finslerian and Riemannian manifolds, we thoroughly benchmark GEORCE against several alternative optimization algorithms and show empirically that it has a much faster and more accurate performance for a variety of manifolds, including key manifolds from information theory and manifolds that are learned using generative models.</description>

      <title>On the structure of compact strong HKT manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of compact strong HKT and, more generally, compact BHE manifolds. We prove that any compact BHE manifold with full holonomy must be K\"ahler and we establish a similar result for strong HKT manifolds. Additionally, we demonstrate a rigidity theorem for strong HKT structures on solvmanifolds and we completely classify those with parallel Bismut torsion. Finally, we introduce the Ricci foliation for hypercomplex manifolds and analyze its properties for compact, simply connected, 8-dimensional strong HKT manifolds, proving that they are always Hopf fibrations over a compact $4$-dimensional orbifold.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Quasi Einstein Characterization Of The Round Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the following result of Cochran ``A closed $m$-quasi Einstein manifold ($M,g,X$) with $m \ne -2$ has constant scalar curvature if and only if $X$ is Killing" covering the missing accidental case $m=-2$ and generalize it showing that $X$ is Killing if the integral of the Lie derivative of the scalar curvature along $X$ is non-positive. For a closed $m$-quasi Einstein manifold of dimension $n$, if $n =2$, $X$ vanishes, and for $n&gt;2$ if $X$ is conformal, then it is Killing; and in addition, if $M$ admits a non-Killing conformal vector field $V$, then it is globally isometric to a sphere and $V$ is gradient. Finally, we derive an integral identity for a vector field on a closed Riemannian manifold which provides a direct proof of the Bourguignon-Ezin conservation identity.</description>

      <title>Infinite combinatorial Ricci flow in spherical background geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the fundamental work of Chow-Luo \cite{CL03}, Ge \cite{Ge12,Ge17} et al., the combinatorial curvature flow methods became a basic technique in the study of circle pattern theory. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial Ricci flow with prescribed total geodesic curvatures in spherical background geometry. For infinite cellular decompositions, we establish the existence of a solution to the flow equation for all time. Furthermore, under an additional condition, we prove that the solution converges as time tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of an infinite combinatorial curvature flow in spherical background geometry.</description>

Abstract: We study the discretization of (almost-)Dirac structures using the notion of retraction and discretization maps on manifolds. Additionally, we apply the proposed discretization techniques to obtain numerical integrators for port-Hamiltonian systems and we discuss how to merge the discretization procedure and the constraint algorithm associated to systems of implicit differential equations.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov's Patchwork and the Bonnet--Myers Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several key results for Lorentzian pre-length spaces with global timelike curvature bounds. Most significantly, we construct a Lorentzian analogue to Alexandrov's Patchwork, thus proving that suitably nice Lorentzian pre-length spaces with local upper timelike curvature bound also satisfy a corresponding global upper bound. Additionally, for spaces with global lower bound on their timelike curvature, we provide a Bonnet--Myers style result, constraining their finite diameter. Throughout, we make the natural comparisons to the metric case, concluding with a discussion of potential applications and ongoing work.</description>

      <title>Growth of spinors in the generalized Seiberg--Witten equations on $\mathbb R^4$ and $\mathbb R^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Seiberg-Witten equations in dimensions three and four admit a natural generalization within a unified framework known as the generalized Seiberg-Witten (GSW) equations, which encompasses many important equations in gauge theory. This article proves that the averaged $L^2$-norm of any spinor with non-constant pointwise norm in the GSW equations on $\mathbb R^4$ and $\mathbb R^3$, measured over large-radius spheres, grows faster than a power of the radius, under a suitable curvature decay assumption. Separately, it is shown that if the Yang-Mills-Higgs energy of any solution of these equations is finite, then the pointwise norm of the spinor in it must converge to a non-negative constant at infinity. These two behaviors cannot occur simultaneously unless the spinor has constant pointwise norm. This work may be seen as partial generalization of results obtained by Taubes[Tau17a], and Nagy and Oliveira [NO19] for the Kapustin-Witten equations.</description>

Abstract: We define and study a multiplicity-free covering of a graded manifold. We compute its deck transformation group, which is isomorphic to the permutation group $S_n$. We show that it is not possible to construct a covering of a graded manifold in the category of $n$-fold vector bundles. As an application of our research, we give a new conceptual proof of the equivalence of the categories of graded manifolds and symmetric $n$-fold vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Some criteria for positive forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of weak and strong positivity for exterior forms on complex vector spaces. We prove a dimensionality reduction argument for positive forms, which allows us to restrict to the case of $(2,2)$-forms in $\mathbb{C}^4$. In this setting, we find criteria for weak positivity based on the associated Hermitian matrix. As an application we prove, by duality, the strong positivity of some families of $(2,2)$-forms, already of interest in works by other authors.</description>

      <title>Reductions: precontact versus presymplectic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that contact reductions can be described in terms of symplectic reductions in the traditional Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer as well as the constant rank picture. The point is that we view contact structures as particular (homogeneous) symplectic structures. A group action by contactomorphisms is lifted to a Hamiltonian action on the corresponding symplectic manifold, called the symplectic cover of the contact manifold. In contrast to the majority of the literature in the subject, our approach includes general contact structures (not only co-oriented) and changes the traditional view point: contact Hamiltonians and contact moment maps for contactomorphism groups are no longer defined on the contact manifold itself, but on its symplectic cover. Actually, the developed framework for reductions is slightly more general than purely contact, and includes a precontact and presymplectic setting which is based on the observation that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of precontact manifolds and certain homogeneous presymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling and Haefliger structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wrinkling techniques, introduced by Eliashberg and Mishachev, are typically used to prove h-principles of the form: ``formal solutions of a partial differential relation $\mathcal{R}$ can be deformed to singular/wrinkled solutions''. What a wrinkled solution is depends on the context, but the overall idea is that it should be an object that fails to be a solution only due to the presence of mild/controlled singularities.
  Much earlier, Haefliger structures were introduced by Haefliger as singular analogues of foliations. Much like a foliation is locally modeled on a submersion, a Haefliger structure is modeled on an arbitrary map. This implies that Haefliger structures have better formal properties than foliations. For instance, they can be pulled back by arbitrary maps and admit a classifying space.
  In [12], the second and third authors generalized the \emph{wrinkled embeddings} of Eliashberg and Mishachev to arbitrary order. This paper can be regarded as a sequel in which we deal instead with generalizations of \emph{wrinkled submersions}. The main messages are that: 1) Haefliger structures provide a nice conceptual framework in which general wrinkling statements can be made. 2) Wrinkling can be interpreted as holonomic approximation into the \'etale space of solutions of the relation $\mathcal{R}$. These statements imply connectivity statements relating (1) $\mathcal{R}$ to its \'etale space of solutions and (2) the classifying space for foliations with transverse $\mathcal{R}$-geometry to its formal counterpart.</description>
