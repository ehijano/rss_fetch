      <title>Enhancing Gain in Non-Hermitian Photonic Crystals with Lossy Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that purely lossy defects in one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic crystals can enable a dramatic gain enhancement not accessible with lossless defects. We further show that the underlying mechanism behind the loss-induced enhancement is due to the resonances being located specifically at topological branch cut phase singularities with nontrivial winding numbers. Additionally we show that these resonances behave as quasi-bound states in the continuum with exceptionally high quality factors $\sim 10^5$ or higher accessible. Our work highlights the counterintuitive role of loss in enhancing gain in non-Hermitian systems and its connection to topological phenomena in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>Photonic neural networks with spatiotemporal chaos in multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing has gained significant attention as a potential solution to the growing computational demands of machine learning, particularly for tasks requiring large-scale data processing and high energy efficiency. Optical systems offer promising alternatives to digital neural networks by exploiting light's parallelism. This study explores a photonic neural network design using spatiotemporal chaos within grad-ed-index multimode fibers to improve machine learning performance. Through numerical simulations and experiments, we show that chaotic light propagation in multimode fibers enhances data classification accu-racy across domains, including biomedical imaging, fashion, and satellite geospatial analysis. This chaotic optical approach enables high-dimensional transformations, amplifying data separability and differentiation for greater accuracy. Fine-tuning parameters such as pulse peak power optimizes the reservoir's chaotic properties, highlighting the need for careful calibration. These findings underscore the potential of chaos-based nonlinear photonic neural networks to advance optical computing in machine learning, paving the way for efficient, scalable architectures.</description>

      <title>Momentum flatband and superluminal propagation in a photonic time Moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands typically describe energy bands whose energy dispersion is entirely or almost entirely degenerate. One effective method to form flat bands is by constructing Moir\'e superlattices. Recently, there has been a shift in perspective regarding the roles of space (momentum) and time (energy) in a lattice, with the concept of photonic time crystals that has sparked discussions on momentum dispersion such as the presence of a bandgap in momentum. Here we propose a photonic time moir\'e superlattice achieved by overlaying two photonic time crystals with different periods. The resulting momentum bandgap of this superlattice supports isolated momentum bands that are nearly independent of energy, which we refer to as momentum flat bands. Unlike energy flat bands, which have zero group velocity, momentum flat bands exhibit infinitely large group velocity across a broad frequency range. Unlike previous optical media supporting broadband superluminal propagation based on gain, the effective refractive index of the momentum flat bands is real-valued, leading to more stabilized superluminal pulse propagation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Phase-Matching Enabled by van der Waals Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-phase matching (QPM) is a technique extensively utilized in nonlinear optics for enhancing the efficiency and stability of frequency conversion processes. However, the conventional QPM relies on periodically poled ferroelectric crystals, which are limited in availability. The 3R phase of molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS2), a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDc) with the broken inversion symmetry, stands out as a promising candidate for QPM, enabling efficient nonlinear process. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the QPM at nanoscale, utilizing van der Waals stacking of 3R-MoS2 layers with specific orientation to realize second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement beyond the non QPM limit. We have also demonstrated enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) via QPM of 3R-MoS2 homo-structure, enabling more efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. The tunable capacity of 3R-MoS2 van der Waals stacking provides a platform for tuning phase-matching condition. This technique opens interesting possibilities for potential applications in nonlinear process and quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Generalized coherent wave control at dynamic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent wave control is of key importance across a broad range of fields such as electromagnetics, photonics, and acoustics. It enables us to amplify or suppress the outgoing waves via engineering amplitudes and phases of multiple incidences. However, within a purely spatially (temporally) engineered medium, coherent wave control requires the frequency of the associated incidences to be identical (opposite). In this work, we break this conventional constraint by generalizing coherent wave control into a spatiotemporally engineered medium, i.e., the system featuring a dynamic interface. Owing to the broken translational symmetry in space and time, both the subluminal and superluminal interfaces allow interference between scattered waves regardless of their different frequencies and wavevectors. Hence, one can flexibly eliminate the backward- or forward-propagating waves scattered from the dynamic interfaces by controlling the incident amplitudes and phases. Our work not only presents a generalized way for reshaping arbitrary waveforms but also provides a promising paradigm to generate ultrafast pulses using low-frequency signals. We have also implemented suppression of forward-propagating waves in microstrip transmission lines with fast photodiode switches.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for inverse freeform design of a point-to-point two-reflector system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a mathematical model for inverse freeform design of an optical system with two reflectors in which light transfers from a point source to a point target. In this model, the angular light intensity emitted from the point source and illuminance arriving at the point target are specified by distributions. To determine the optical mapping and the shape of the reflectors, we use the optical path length and take energy conservation into account, through which we obtain a generated Jacobian equation. We express the system in both spherical and stereographic coordinates, and solve it using a sophisticated least-squares algorithm. Several examples illustrate the algorithm's capabilities to tackle complicated light distributions.</description>

      <title>Spintwistronics in Photonic Topological Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics, the manipulation of Moir\'e superlattices via the twisting of two layers of two-dimensional (2D) materials to control diverse and nontrivial properties, has recently revolutionized the condensed matter and materials physics. Here, for the first time, we introduce the principles of twistronics to spin photonics, coining this emerging field spintwistronics. In spintwistronics, instead of 2D materials, the two layers consist of photonic topological spin lattices on a surface plasmonic polariton (SPP) platform. Each 2D SPP wave supports the construction of topological lattices formed by photonic spins with stable skyrmion topology governed by rotational symmetry. By introducing spintwistronics into plasmonics, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that two layers of photonic spin lattices can produce Moir\'e spin superlattices at specific magic angles. These superlattices, modulated periodically by the quantum number of total angular momentum, exhibit novel properties-including new quasiparticle topologies, fractal patterns, slow-light control, and more-that cannot be achieved in conventional plasmonic systems.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Excitable Spiking Laser Neuron in InP Generic Integration Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired, neuromorphic devices implemented in integrated photonic hardware have attracted significant interest recently as part of efforts towards novel non-von Neumann computing paradigms that make use of the low loss, high-speed and parallel operations in optics. An all-optical spiking laser neuron fabricated on the indium-phosphide generic integration technology platform may be a practical alternative to other semi-integrated photonic and electronic-based spiking neuron implementations. Owing to the large number of predefined building blocks, a plethora of applications have benefitted already from the generic integration process. This technology platform has now been utilised for the first time to demonstrate an all-optical spiking laser neuron. This paper present and discusses the design and measurement of the ultra-fast and rich spiking dynamics in these devices. We show that under external pulse injection and operated slightly below the lasing threshold, the laser neuron exhibits an excitable mode, in addition to a self-spiking mode far above the threshold when no pulse is injected. In the excitable mode, the required injected pulse energy is much lower than that of the generated excited response, meeting an important requirement for neuron cascadability. In addition, we investigate excitability at different injection wavelengths below the lasing wavelength, as well as the ultra-fast temporal properties of the spiking response. All of the discussed characteristics point to the laser neuron being an important candidate for scaling up to future fully-connected, multi-wavelength all-optical photonic spiking neural networks in indium-phosphide generic integration technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key requirement for quantum technologies based on atoms, ions, and molecules, is the ability to realize precise phase- and amplitude-controlled quantum operations via coherent laser pulses. However, for generating pulses on the sub-microsecond timescale, the characteristics of the optical and electronic components can introduce unwanted distortions that have a detrimental effect on the fidelity of quantum operations. In this paper, we present a compact arbitrary waveform generator that integrates a double-pass acousto-optic modulator for user-specified laser amplitude and phase modulations. Additionally, the module integrates an optical heterodyne detector to extract the precise laser pulse shape in real-time. The measured pulse shape is then fed into a digital feedback loop used to estimate the complex-valued transfer function and pre-distorted input pulses. We demonstrate the performance by generating shaped laser pulses suitable for realizing quantum logic gates with durations down to 180\,ns, requiring only a small number of feedback iterations.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Interplay of Large Language Model and Digital Twin for Autonomous Optical Networks: Field Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLM) has revolutionized various fields and is anticipated to drive the advancement of autonomous systems. In the context of autonomous optical networks, creating a high-level cognitive agent in the control layer remains a challenge. However, LLM is primarily developed for natural language processing tasks, rendering them less effective in predicting the physical dynamics of optical communications. Moreover, optical networks demand rigorous stability, where direct deployment of strategies generated from LLM poses safety concerns. In this paper, a digital twin (DT)-enhanced LLM scheme is proposed to facilitate autonomous optical networks. By leveraging monitoring data and advanced models, the DT of optical networks can accurately characterize their physical dynamics, furnishing LLMs with dynamic-updated information for reliable decision-making. Prior to deployment, the generated strategies from LLM can be pre-verified in the DT platform, which also provides feedback to the LLM for further refinement of strategies. The synergistic interplay between DT and LLM for autonomous optical networks is demonstrated through three scenarios: performance optimization under dynamic loadings in an experimental C+L-band long-haul transmission link, protection switching for device upgrading in a field-deployed six-node mesh network, and performance recovery after fiber cuts in a field-deployed C+L-band transmission link.</description>

Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Perfectly vertical silicon metamaterial grating couplers with large segmentation periods up to 650 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perfectly vertical grating couplers leveraging metamaterials can achieve both high coupling efficiency and minimal back reflection. The fabricability of these designs, with segmentations in both the longitudinal and transverse dimensions, hinges on the minimum feature size offered by cutting-edge fabrication technologies. In this work we present both numerical and experimental evidence that high performance devices can be obtained while using large transverse segmentation periods of up to 650 nm, thereby increasing the critical feature sizes. For single-step etched couplers produced on the 220 nm silicon-on-insulator platform, we demonstrate coupling efficiencies of nearly 50% in the C-band and remarkably low back reflections of -22 dB at zero-degree incidence angle. Notably, the duty cycles used in our optimized designs deviate significantly from those predicted by traditional effective medium models, even for small periods. Our findings promise to expand the range of optical properties achievable in metamaterials and offer fresh insights into the fine-tuning of nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated Spectroscopy Capable of Temperature Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a chip-integrated emission spectroscope capable of retrieving the temperature of the light sources. It consists of a single photon detector with low dark counts and a sweeping on-chip filter with 2 pm spectral resolution in the visible and near-infrared regimes. With wildfire sensing applications in mind, we test our system with a hollow cathode lamp to simulate the K-line emission, and show how the models of Doppler and collision broadening in the plasma can be used for temperature retrieval. With favorable device parameters, high spectral resolution, and a novel temperature retrieval capability, our technique may find broad applications in environmental monitoring, astrophysics, plasma physics, and so on.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Switching of THz Signal in Planar Structured Spintronic Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Design of Fiber-Longitudinal Optical Power Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical results on the accuracy of fiber-longitudinal optical power monitoring (LPM) at arbitrary positions. To quantify the accuracy, the position-wise variance and power-profile SNR of LPM are defined and analyzed, yielding formulas for these metrics. Using these metrics, we show that various designs and performance predictions of LPM for a given link and estimation conditions are possible in a unified manner. Specifically, the required SNR to detect a given loss event is first presented. Based on this relation, the design parameters of LPM, such as the sample size and optical power required to detect the loss, are explicitly determined. The performance such as the detectable limit of loss events at individual positions and maximum dynamic range are also specified. These results can be used as a basis for establishing a design principle of LPM.</description>
