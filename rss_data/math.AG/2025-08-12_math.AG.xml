      <title>A Conditional Reduction of the Rational Hodge Conjecture for Threefolds and Deformation-Theoretic Verifications in Several Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a concrete geometric approximation hypothesis (Hypothesis~BB) asserting that codimension-$2$ Hodge classes on a smooth projective threefold can be realized as specializations of families whose general members are complete-intersection curves. We prove that Hypothesis~BB implies the (rational) Hodge conjecture for the threefold. We then give deformation-theoretic sufficient criteria (cohomology-vanishing and surjectivity conditions) which imply Hypothesis~BB, and we prove these criteria hold for the class of a line on a \emph{general} quintic threefold containing that line. We further formulate and prove several propositions showing that, under natural Noether--Lefschetz and unobstructedness hypotheses, Hypothesis~BB holds \emph{generically} in families of Calabi--Yau and Fano threefolds; these propositions reduce the problem to checkable conditions (normal-bundle cohomology, surjectivity of restriction maps). Finally, we include a Macaulay2 appendix with scripts to verify the required cohomology and splitting conditions in explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Characteristic cycles for coadmissible D-modules on smooth rigid analytic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be a formal smooth curve over a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic and let $\mathfrak{X}_K$ be its generic fiber. We consider respectively over $\mathfrak{X}$ and $\mathfrak{X}_K$ the sheaves of differential operators $\mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak{X}, \infty}$ and $\overparen{\mathcal{D}}_{\mathfrak{X}_K}$ with a rapid convergence condition. In this article, we define a characteristic variety as a closed subset of the cotangent space $T^*\mathfrak{X}_K$ together with a characteristic cycle for coadmissible $\overparen{\mathcal{D}}_{\mathfrak{X}_K}$-modules. We deduce a notion of "sub-holonomicity" for coadmissible $\overparen{\mathcal{D}}_{\mathfrak{X}_K}$-modules which is equivalent to being generically an integrable connection. Moreover, we prove that a coadmissible $\overparen{\mathcal{D}}_{\mathfrak{X}_K}$-modules is sub-holonomic if and only if the corresponding coadmissible $\mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak{X}, \infty}$-module is in the sense of \cite{hallopeau3}.</description>

      <title>Profiles, linear spaces, and unirationality of complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete intersections may be unexpectedly simple over fields of positive characteristic: for instance, they may be unirational despite being of general type. One explanation is given by profiles, structure that tracks the special shape of polynomials, refining the degree. The aim of this work is to show that complete intersections with small profile should be considered simple by generalizing two classical results on low degree complete intersections: First, the basic geometry of Fano schemes associated with complete intersections depends only on the profile, so that complete intersections with small profile contain many linear spaces. Second, a general complete intersection is unirational once its dimension is sufficiently large compared to its profile.</description>

      <title>Dubrovin-Natanzon divisors on MM-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves are rational degenerations of ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves, i.e. they are maximal Mumford in the sense that they posses $g$ tropical cycles and exactly $g+1$ real ovals, where $g$ is the arithmetic genus. For rational curves the ``naive'' definition of divisors as formal sums of points requires a refinement. In the finite-gap theory of KP II equation the real regular solutions correspond to the Dubrovin-Natanzon (DN) divisors on ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves. In the case of real regular multiline KP II solitons, it was shown by the authors that for any given solution there exists a normalization time such that the spectral data are smooth DN divisor on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curve.
  However, to show that DN divisors parameterize the; full positroid cell, it is necessary to fix the normalization time and consider both smooth and non-smooth divisors. In this paper we start such an investigation, and show that on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves whose dual graphs are trivalent Le-graphs of totally positive Schubert cells, the construction of non-smooth DN divisors requires combinations of just two basic types of blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Geometry and Geometric Class Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an upgrade of Deligne's geometric class field theory for tamely ramified Galois groups using logarithmic geometry. In particular, we define a framed logarithmic Picard space, and show that a logarithmic compactification of the classical tamely ramified Div-to-Pic map has, for sufficiently large degree, log simply connected fibers given by loagrithmically compactified vector spaces. This provides a canonical bijection between local systems on the curve with divisorial log structure and multiplicative local systems on the framed logarithmic Picard (a logarithmic version of the Hecke eigensheaf correspondence of Geometric Langlands for GL_1. We use this to re-derive tamely ramified global Artin reciprocity for function fields, and show that logarithmic geometry allows for a geometric interpretation of local-to-global compatibility at all places (in addition to the unramified places).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of stable maps from pointed curves, where the points are allowed to coincide, with target a tame Deligne-Mumford stack. This generalizes the Abramovich-Vistoli theory of twisted stable maps as well as work of Hassett, Alexeev and Guy, and Bayer and Manin, who studied stable maps to projective varieties from curves with weighted marked points.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Witt theory of derived schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic ring spectrum $\mathrm{KO}$ over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, whose associated cohomology theory on qcqs derived schemes is the Grothendieck-Witt theory of classical symmetric forms (as opposed to homotopy symmetric forms). In particular, we show that this theory satisfies Nisnevich descent, smooth blowup excision, a projective bundle formula, and is locally left Kan extended from smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes up to Bass delooping. More generally, our construction produces $\mathrm{KO}$-modules representing localizing invariants of two different families of Poincar\'e structures on derived schemes, which we call "classical" and "genuine"; the latter Poincar\'e structures are defined for spectral schemes with involution, but the former only for derived schemes.
  We then establish basic properties of these motivic spectra. As in $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory, the fracture square of $\mathrm{KO}$ with respect to the Hopf element recovers the fundamental cartesian square relating GW-theory, L-theory, and K-theory. A new phenomenon when $2$ is not a unit is that $\mathrm{KO}$ is not Bott-periodic, and the left and right Bott periodizations of $\mathrm{KO}$ represent the Grothendieck-Witt theories of homotopy symmetric and homotopy quadratic forms, respectively. We also construct the expected metalinear $\mathrm{E}_\infty$-orientation of $\mathrm{KO}$. Finally, we show that the $\mathbb{A}^1$-localization of $\mathrm{KO}$ recovers the motivic spectrum recently constructed by Calm\`es, Harpaz, and Nardin.</description>

      <title>Hilbert schemes of elliptic surfaces: group actions and derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\to C$ be an elliptic surface with integral fibers and a section. The Hilbert scheme $X^{[n]}$ fibers over $C^{[n]}$. We construct a commutative group scheme over the entire base $C^{[n]}$ that embeds as an open subscheme of the Hilbert scheme, such that its action on itself extends to the entirety of $X^{[n]}$. We show that the action is $\delta$-regular in the sense of Ng\^o. Using the derived McKay correspondence, we construct an exact autoequivalence of $D^b\operatorname{Coh}(X^{[n]})$ whose kernel is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay sheaf on the fiber product. We show that this Fourier-Mukai transform intertwines with our group action, i.e. theorem of the square holds. We also discuss the case without a section using the theory of Tate-Shafarevich twists.</description>

      <title>Splittings in a complete local ring and decomposition its group of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we prove that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In addition, if $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, then we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. As an application of this theorem, we show that the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. We also show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for most incomplete local rings. In an attempt to prove the above main theorem, we first obtained a characterization for separability which states that an algebraic extension of fields is separable if and only if it is formally \'etale. In particular, in the characteristic zero, every algebraic extension of fields is formally \'etale. Next, we show that every field extension over a perfect field is formally smooth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a variety of finiteness questions for preperiodic points of morphisms. We begin by treating a group action analog of the Burnside problem for torsion groups using the p-adic arc method. We then prove some results connecting commonality of preperiodic points for elements of an automorphism group with structural properties of the group; these results are related to well-known results of Tits and Borel. We finish by proving some Northcott-type results for finite morphisms.</description>

Abstract: We give a new method to attempt to prove that, for a given $n$, there are finitely many equivalence classes of planar central configurations in the Newtonian $n$-body problem for generic masses.
  The human part of the proof relies on tropical geometry. The crux of our technique is in a computation that we have completed for $n\leq 5$, thus confirming the celebrated result of Albouy and Kaloshin.</description>

We give an explicit description of isotopy types of real lines on $Y_{\mathbb R}$ and an explicit presentation of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in the mapping class group $\operatorname{Mod}(X_{\mathbb R})$. Combining these results we establish an explicit formula for the action of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in $H_1(X_{\mathbb R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of Green and Griffiths states that for the generic curve $C$ over $\mathbb{C}$ of genus $g \geq 4$ with a canonical divisor $K$, its Faber--Pandharipande 0-cycle $K\times K-(2g-2)K_\Delta$ on $C\times C$ is nontorsion in the Chow group of rational equivalence classes. However, according to a conjecture of Beilinson and Bloch, this Chow cycle vanishes if the curve is defined over a number field. We give a proof of this prediction for Shimura curves which have real multiplication. Our method also works for some other classes curves with partial real multiplication. We also draw a connection between the Faber--Pandharipande 0-cycles and torsion points on curves under the Abel--Jacobi map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of generalized log twisted curves, which are marked nodal curves with additional data at the marked points. In the case when the markings are distinct this notion agrees with the notion of twisted curve introduced by Abramovich and Vistoli. In addition to developing the basic notions and results, we study in this article the moduli of such curves as well as contraction maps between them. This is motivated, in part, by applications to twisted stable maps which will be studied in a subsequent article.</description>

      <title>Valuative compactifications of analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbf{C}$. We define a canonical compactification $X^{\!\urcorner}$ of the complex analytic space $X(\mathbf{C})$ by adding a Berkovich space over a trivially valued field at the boundary. The construction is functorial with respect to proper morphisms and preserves many properties, such as normality, regularity, etc. We prove a partial GAGA theorem in this setting : there is an equivalence between the categories of coherent sheaves on $X$ and $X^{\!\urcorner}$, and it induces bijections on global sections. The results still hold if $\mathbf{C}$ is replaced by a complete non-trivially valued field $k$, and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich analytic spaces over $k$.</description>

      <title>Complexes of differential forms and singularities: The injectivity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is proved, that for varieties with (m-1)-Du Bois singularities, the natural morphism from the Grothendieck dual of the m-th graded Du Bois complex to the Grothendieck dual of its zero-th cohomology sheaf is injective on cohomology. This confirms Conjecture G of Popa, Shen, and Vo [PSV24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.09733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build foundations of an approach to study canonical forms of $2$-Calabi--Yau triangulated categories with cluster-tilting objects, using dg algebras and relative singularity categories. This is motivated by cluster theory, singularity categories, Wemyss's Homological Minimal Model Program and the relations between these topics.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Degrees of Brownian Motion Tree Models: Star Trees and Root Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Brownian motion tree (BMT) model is a Gaussian model whose associated set of covariance matrices is linearly constrained according to common ancestry in a phylogenetic tree. We study the complexity of inferring the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for a BMT model by computing its ML-degree. Our main result is that the ML-degree of the BMT model on a star tree with $n + 1$ leaves is $2^{n+1}-2n-3$, which was previously conjectured by Am\'endola and Zwiernik. We also prove that the ML-degree of a BMT model is independent of the choice of the root. The proofs rely on the toric geometry of concentration matrices in a BMT model. Toward this end, we produce a combinatorial formula for the determinant of the concentration matrix of a BMT model, which generalizes the Cayley-Pr\"ufer theorem to complete graphs with weights given by a tree.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of associated primes for local cohomology modules of excellent locally unramified regular rings of finite Krull dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thirty years ago, Huneke (for local rings) and Lyubeznik (in general) conjectured that for all regular rings $R$, the local cohomology modules $H^i_I(R)$ have finitely many associated prime ideals. We prove substantial new cases of their conjecture by proving that the local cohomology modules $H^i_I(R)$ have finitely many associated prime ideals whenever $R$ is an excellent regular ring of finite Krull dimension such that $R/pR$ is regular and $F$-finite for every prime number $p$. Our result is new even for excellent regular $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras of finite Krull dimension, for example for finitely generated rings over formal power series rings over fields of characteristic zero. Our proof uses perverse sheaves, $\mathscr{D}$-modules, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for smooth complex varieties, N\'eron-Popescu desingularization, and a delicate Noetherian approximation argument.</description>
