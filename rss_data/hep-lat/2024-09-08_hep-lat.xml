      <title>Multiple right hand side multigrid for domain wall fermions with a multigrid preconditioned block conjugate gradient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of efficient multiple right-hand side multigrid algorithm for domain wall fermions. The simultaneous solution for a modest number of right hand sides concurrently allows for a significant reduction in the time spent solving the coarse grid operator in a multigrid preconditioner. We introduce a preconditioned block conjuate gradient with a multigrid preconditioner, giving additional algorithmic benefit from the multiple right hand sides. There is also a very significant additional to computation rate benefit to multiple right hand sides. This both increases the arithmetic intensity in the coarse space and increases the amount of work being performed in each subroutine call, leading to excellent performance on modern GPU architectures. Further, the software implementation makes use of vendor linear algebra routines (batched GEMM) that can make use of high throughput tensor hardware on recent Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. The cost of the coarse space is made sub-dominant in this algorithm, and benchmarks from the Frontier supercomputer system show up to a factor of twenty speed up over the standard red-black preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm on a large system with physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.</description>

      <title>Bayesian solution to the inverse problem and its relation to Backus-Gilbert methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of obtaining spectral densities from lattice data has been receiving great attention due to its importance in our understanding of scattering processes in Quantum Field Theory, with applications both in the Standard Model and beyond. The problem is notoriously difficult as it amounts to performing an inverse Laplace transform, starting from a finite set of noisy data. Several strategies are now available to tackle this inverse problem. In this work, we discuss how Backus-Gilbert methods, in particular the variation introduced by some of the authors, relate to the solution based on Gaussian Processes. Both methods allow computing spectral densities smearing with a kernel, whose features depend on the detail of the algorithm. We will discuss such kernel, and show how Backus-Gilbert methods can be understood in a Bayesian fashion. As a consequence of this correspondence, we are able to interpret the algorithmic parameters of Backus-Gilbert methods as hyperparameters in the Bayesian language, which can be chosen by maximising a likelihood function. By performing a comparative study on lattice data, we show that, when both frameworks are set to compute the same quantity, the results are generally in agreement. Finally, we adopt a strategy to systematically validate both methodologies against pseudo-data, using covariance matrices measured from lattice simulations. In our setup, we find that the determination of the algorithmic parameters based on a stability analysis provides results that are, on average, more conservative than those based on the maximisation of a likelihood function.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an Arbitrary Surface for Discrete Gravity and for $d=2$ Pure Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computation of curvature of arbitrary two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimensional objects, which is a contribution to discrete gravity with potential applications in network geometry. We begin by linking each point of the surface in question to its four closest neighbors, forming quads. We then focus on the simplices of $d=2$, or triangles embedded in these quads, which make up a pure simplicial complex with $d=2$. This allows us to numerically compute the local metric along with zweibeins, which subsequently leads to a derivation of discrete curvature defined at every triangle or face. We provide an efficient algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})$ complexity that first orients two-dimensional surfaces, solves the nonlinear system of equations of the spin-connections resulting from the torsion condition, and returns the value of curvature at each face.</description>

      <title>An efficient finite-resource formulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories provide an accurate description of fundamental interactions, as both perturbation theory and quantum Monte Carlo computations in lattice gauge theory, it when applicable, show remarkable agreement with experimental data from particle colliders and cosmological observations. Complementing these computations, or combining them with quantum-inspired Hamiltonian lattice computations on quantum machines to improve continuum limit predictions with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Static force from generalized Wilson loops on the lattice using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static QCD force from the lattice can be used to extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$, which determines the running of the strong coupling. Usually, this is done with a numerical derivative of the static potential. However, this introduces additional systematic uncertainties; thus, we use another observable to measure the static force directly. This observable consists of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field insertion. We work in the pure SU(3) gauge theory. We use gradient flow to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to address the field insertion. We extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0}$ from the data by exploring different methods to perform the zero-flow-time limit. We obtain the value $\sqrt{8t_0} \Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0} =0.629^{+22}_{-26}$, where $t_0$ is a flow-time reference scale. We also obtain precise determinations of several scales: $r_0/r_1$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_0$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_1$ and we compare these to the literature. The gradient flow appears to be a promising method for calculations of Wilson loops with chromoelectric and chromomagnetic insertions in quenched and unquenched configurations</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>
