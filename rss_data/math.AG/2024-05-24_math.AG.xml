      <title>Structures of $\epsilon$-lc Calabi--Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structures of $\epsilon$-lc Calabi--Yau pairs. We show that such pairs possess a finite cover that is isomorphic in codimension 1 with a fiber product of a Calabi--Yau variety and a rationally connected variety. Moreover, the degree of the cover depends only on $\epsilon$ and the dimension. As a corollary, we show that the index of 4-dimensional non-canonical Calabi--Yau variety is bounded. We also prove a boundedness result on polarized $\epsilon$-lc Calabi--Yau pairs.</description>

      <title>Tate-Shafarevich results for quartic twists in characteristic $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present elliptic curves defined over function fields of even characteristic having arbitrarily large Mordell-Weil rank. More precisely, we study elliptic curves arising as quartic twist of a supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_2$ using the function field of a maximal curve $C$ that admits an order 4 automorphism. For such elliptic curves we provide a rank formula for its Mordell-Weil group in terms of the genera of $C$ and of another curve covered by $C$.</description>

      <title>Effective gonality theorem on weight-one syzygies of algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986, Green-Lazarsfeld raised the gonality conjecture asserting that the gonality $\operatorname{gon}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g\geq 2$ can be read off from weight-one syzygies of a sufficiently positive line bundle $L$ on $C$, and also proposed possible least degree of such a line bundle. In 2015, Ein-Lazarsfeld proved the conjecture when $\operatorname{deg} L$ is sufficiently large, but the effective part of the conjecture remained widely open and was reformulated explicitly by Farkas-Kemeny. In this paper, we establish an effective vanishing theorem for weight-one syzygies, which implies that the gonality conjecture holds if $\operatorname{deg} L \geq 2g+\operatorname{gon}(C)$ or $\operatorname{deg} L = 2g+\operatorname{gon}(C)-1$ and $C$ is not a plane curve. As Castryck observed that the gonality conjecture may not hold for a plane curve when $\operatorname{deg} L = 2g+\operatorname{gon}(C)-1$, our theorem is the best possible and thus gives a complete answer to the gonality conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EPW cubes form a locally complete family of smooth projective hyper-K\"ahler varieties of dimension 6, constructed by Iliev--Kapustka--Kapustka--Ranestad.\ Their construction and behavior share a lot of similarities with the double EPW sextics constructed by O'Grady.\ Adapting the methods of O'Grady, we construct a projective smooth small resolution of singular EPW cubes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of rational quasi-independence models as toric fiber products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a family of log-linear statistical models called quasi-independence models. The toric fiber product is useful for understanding the geometry of parameter inference in these models because the maximum likelihood degree is multiplicative under the TFP. We define the coordinate toric fiber product, or cTFP, and give necessary and sufficient conditions under which a quasi-independence model is a cTFP of lower-order models. We show that the vanishing ideal of every 2-way quasi-independence model with ML-degree 1 can be realized as an iterated toric fiber product of linear ideals. We also classify which Lawrence lifts of 2-way quasi-independence models are cTFPs and give a necessary condition under which a $k$-way model has ML-degree 1 using its facial submodels.</description>

Abstract: Working in an abstract, homotopy type theory based axiomatization of the higher Zariski-topos called synthetic algebraic geometry, we show that the Picard group of projective n-space is the integers, the automorphism group of projective n-space is PGL(n+1) and morphisms between projective standard spaces are given by homogenous polynomials in the usual way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a basis of the set of K\"{a}hler differentials of an irreducible germ of holomorphic plane curve whose non-trivial elements correspond to dicritical foliations. Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described. Moreover, we give an algorithmic construction of the bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p$. It is a natural question whether the Frobenius pushforwards $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ of the structure sheaf are tilting bundles. We show if $X$ is a smooth del Pezzo surface of degree $\leq 3$ or a Fano threefold with $\mathrm{vol}(K_X)&lt;24$ over a field of characteristic $p$, then $\mathrm{Ext}^i(F_*^e\mathcal O_X,F^e_*\mathcal O_X)\neq 0$ and thus $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ is not tilting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the log motivic nearby cycles functor. We show that this sends the motive of a proper smooth scheme over the fraction field of a DVR to the motive of the boundary of a log smooth model assuming absolute purity, which is unconditional in the equal characteristic case. In characteristic $0$, we show that the $\infty$-categories of motives over the standard log point and rigid analytic motives are equivalent, and we relate log motivic nearby cycles functor with Ayoub's motivic nearby cycles functor.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the congruence on the tropical rational function semifield in $n$-variables associated with a subset $V$ of $\boldsymbol{R}^n$ is finitely generated if and only if the closure of $V$ is a finite union of $\boldsymbol{R}$-rational polyhedral sets. With this fact, we characterize rational function semifields of tropical curves.</description>

      <title>Derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on a smooth toric variety and Koszul duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a smooth toric variety defined by the fan {\Sigma} . We consider {\Sigma} as a finite set with topology and define a natural sheaf of graded algebras A_{\Sigma} on {\Sigma} . The category of modules over A_{\Sigma} is studied (together with other related categories). This leads to a certain combinatorial Koszul duality equivalence. We describe the equivariant category of coherent sheaves coh_{X,T} and a related (slightly bigger) equivariant category O_{X,T}-mod in terms of sheaves of modules over the sheaf of algebras A_{\Sigma} . Eventually (for a complete X ) the combinatorial Koszul duality is interpreted in terms of the Serre functor on D^b(coh_{X,T})</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are expanded notes from a talk at the RIMS Workshop, Algebraic Number Theory and Related Topics, December 13th, 2023. We discussed Elmanto-Morrow's motivic complex, the procdh sheafification of the classical motivic complex, and their comparison. The procdh topology and the comparison is joint work with Shuji Saito. The comparison was obtained through joint discussion with Morrow, and its proof relies heavily on the main results of [EM23].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathrm{Mov}}^k(X)$ be the closure of the cone $\mathrm{Mov}^k(X)$ generated by classes of effective divisors on a projective variety $X$ with stable base locus of codimension at least $k+1$. We propose a generalized version of the Log Nonvanishing Conjecture and of the Log Abundance Conjecture for a klt pair $(X,\Delta)$, that is: if $K_X+\Delta \in \overline{\mathrm{Mov}}^{k}(X)$, then $K_X+\Delta \in \mathrm{Mov}^{k}(X)$. Moreover, we prove that if the Log Minimal Model Program, the Log Nonvanishing, and the Log Abundance hold, then so does our conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a minimal irregular surface of general type, whose Albanese map induces a fibration $f:\,S \to C$ of genus $g$.We prove a linear upper bound on the genus $g$ if $K_S^2\leq 4\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$. Examples are constructed showing that the above linear upper bound is sharp.We also construct a sequence of surfaces $S_n$ of general type with $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})&gt;4$ and with an Albanese fibration $f_n$, such that the genus $g_n$ of a general fiber of $f_n$ increases quadratically with $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$, and that $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$ can be arbitrarily close to $4$.</description>

We deduce the Floer-theoretic filtrations on the cohomology of these spaces, introduced by Ritter and the second author in arXiv:2304.13026. Filtration is then compared with the $``P=W"$ and the filtration obtained by multiplicities of the irreducible components of the nilpotent cone, for all the 2-dimensional Higgs moduli.</description>

Abstract: This article, written in Spanish, provides a comprehensive review of the Fargues-Fontaine curve, a cornerstone in $p$-adic Hodge theory, and its pivotal role in classifying $p$-adic Galois representations. We synthesize key developments surrounding this curve, emphasizing its connection between advanced concepts in arithmetic geometry and the practical theory of representations. We offer a detailed analysis of the Fontaine period rings ($B_{cris}, B_{st}, B_{dR}$), exploring their crucial algebraic and arithmetic properties and their contribution to the curve's construction and definition. Furthermore, we delve into the theory of admissible $p$-adic Galois representations, discussing how the curve, once defined, integrates with Harder-Narasimhan theory.</description>

Abstract: We obtain new complexity bounds for computing a triangular integral basis of a number field or a function field. We reach for function fields a softly linear cost with respect to the size of the output when the residual characteristic is zero or big enough. Analogous results are obtained for integral basis of fractional ideals, key ingredients towards fast computation of Riemann-Roch spaces. The proof is based on the recent fast OM algorithm of the authors and on the MaxMin algorithm of Stainsby, together with optimal truncation bounds and a precise complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Verifying feasibility of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms).
  We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method in [Henrion, Naldi, Safey El Din; SIAM J. Optim., 2016]; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which [Henrion, Naldi, Safey El Din; SIAM J. Optim., 2016] failed. We argue that our approach may have other uses, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Orbit structures and complexity in Schubert and Richardson Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide a type-uniform formula for the torus complexity of the usual torus action on a Richardson variety, by developing the notion of algebraic dimensions of Bruhat intervals, strengthening a type A result by Donten-Bury, Escobar and Portakal. In the process, we give an explicit description of the torus action on any Deodhar component as well as describe the root subgroups that comprise the component. Secondly, we exhibit a codimension preserving bijection between Levi-Borel subgroup (a Borel subgroup of a Levi subgroup in a reductive algebraic group) orbits in the big open cell of a Schubert variety and torus orbits in the big open cell of a distinguished Schubert subvariety. This bijection has many applications: a type-uniform formula for the Levi-Borel complexity of the usual Levi-Borel subgroup action on a Schubert variety as well as an indexing set for Levi-Borel subgroup orbits in a Schubert variety. We conclude by extending the Levi-Borel complexity results to a large class of Schubert varieties in the partial flag variety.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Independence of Special Points on Shimura Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a correspondence $V$ between a connected Shimura variety $S$, a commutative connected algebraic group $T$, and $n \in \N$, we prove that the $V$-images of any $n$ special points on $S$ outside a proper Zariski closed subset are algebraically independent. Our result unifies previous unlikely intersection results on multiplicative independence and linear independence. We prove multiplicative independence of differences of singular moduli, generalizing previous results by Pila-Tsimerman, and Aslanlyan-Eterovi\'c-Fowler. We also give an application to abelian varieties by proving that the special points of $S$ whose $V$-images lie in a finite-rank subgroup of $T$ are contained in a finite union of proper special subvarieties of $S$, only dependent on the rank of the subgroup. In this way, our result is a generalization of the works of Pila-Tsimerman and Buium-Poonen.</description>

Abstract: We define sesquilinear (conjugate linear) pairings generalizing the Weil and Tate-Lichtenbaum pairings on elliptic curves. Specifically, on elliptic curves with complex multiplication by a ring R, these pairings act R-linearly (or conjugate R-linearly), with values in an R-module.</description>

      <title>Integration of Hochschild cohomology, derived Picard groups and uniqueness of lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the maximum $h_{max}$ and the minimum $h_{min}$ of the Hilbert vectors of Perazzo algebras $A_F$, where $F$ is a Perazzo polynomial of degree $d$ in $n+m+1$ variables. These algebras always fail the Strong Lefschetz Property. We determine the integers $n,m,d$ such that $h_{max}$ (resp. $h_{min}$) is unimodal, and we prove that $A_F$ always fails the Weak Lefschetz Property if its Hilbert vector is maximum, while it satisfies the Weak Lefschetz Property if it is minimum, unimodal, and satisfies an additional mild condition. We determine the minimal free resolution of Perazzo algebras associated to Perazzo threefolds in $\mathbb P^4$ with minimum Hilbert vectors. Finally we pose some open problems in this context.

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

Abstract: We establish interval arithmetic as a practical tool for certification in numerical algebraic geometry. Our software HomotopyContinuation.jl now has a built-in function certify, which proves the correctness of an isolated nonsingular solution to a square system of polynomial equations. The implementation rests on Krawczyk's method. We demonstrate that it dramatically outperforms earlier approaches to certification. We see this contribution as powerful new tool in numerical algebraic geometry, that can make certification the default and not just an option.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of poly-stable pairs of formal schemes over the valuation ring of a non-archimedean field. For such pairs we define and investigate the dual intersection complex. We proceed to develop the so called extended skeleton of a poly-stable pair via an approximation process using the classical skeletons constructed by Berkovich. This is essentially a generalization of a construction by Gubler, Rabinoff and Werner from the strictly semi-stable case to the arbitrary poly-stable case and we extend their results.</description>

Abstract: We study the Newton stratification in the $B_\mathrm{dR}^+$-Grassmannian for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ associated to an arbitrary (possibly nonbasic) element of $B(\mathrm{GL}_n)$. Our main result classifies all nonempty Newton strata in an arbitrary minuscule Schubert cell. For a large class of elements in $B(\mathrm{GL}_n)$, our classification is given by some explicit conditions in terms of Newton polygons. For the proof, we proceed by induction on n using a previous result of the author that classifies all extensions of two given vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the zero-fiber of the moment map of a totally negative quiver has rational singularities. Our proof consists in generalizing dimension bounds on jet spaces of this fiber, which were introduced by Budur. We also transfer the rational singularities property to other moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories, based on recent work of Davison. This has interesting arithmetic applications on quiver moment maps and moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories. First, we generalize results of Wyss on the asymptotic behaviour of counts of jets of quiver moment maps over finite fields. Moreover, we interpret the limit of counts of jets on a given moduli space as its p-adic volume under a canonical measure analogous to the measure built by Carocci, Orecchia and Wyss on certain moduli spaces of coherent sheaves.</description>

Abstract: We explore the applications of Lorentzian polynomials to the fields of algebraic geometry, analytic geometry and convex geometry. In particular, we establish a series of intersection theoretic inequalities, which we call rKT property, with respect to $m$-positive classes and Schur classes. We also study its convexity variants -- the geometric inequalities for $m$-convex functions on the sphere and convex bodies. Along the exploration, we prove that any finite subset on the closure of the cone generated by $m$-positive classes can be endowed with a polymatroid structure by a canonical numerical-dimension type function, extending our previous result for nef classes; and we prove Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for valuations of Schur type. We also establish various analogs of sumset estimates (Pl\"{u}nnecke-Ruzsa inequalities) from additive combinatorics in our contexts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study certain moduli spaces of vector bundles on the blowup of the projective plane in at least 10 very general points. Moduli spaces of sheaves on general type surfaces may be nonreduced, reducible and even disconnected. In contrast, moduli spaces of sheaves on minimal rational surfaces and certain del Pezzo surfaces are irreducible and smooth along the locus of stable bundles. We find examples of moduli spaces of vector bundles on more general blowups of the projective plane that are disconnected and have components of different dimensions. In fact, assuming the SHGH Conjecture, we can find moduli spaces with arbitrarily many components of arbitrarily large dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define log Hochschild co/homology for log schemes that behaves well for simple normal crossing pairs $(X,D)$ or toroidal singularities.
  We prove a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for log smooth schemes, as well as an equivariant version for log orbifolds. We define cyclic homology and compute it in simple cases. We show that log Hochschild co/homology is invariant under log alterations.
  Our main technical result in log geometry shows the tropicalization (Artin fan) of a product of log schemes $X \times Y$ is usually the product of the tropicalizations of $X$ and $Y$. This and the machinery of \emph{formality} of derived intersections facilitate a geometric approach to log Hochschild.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study how the absolute coregularity of a projective log pair reflects on its fundamental group. More precisely, we conjecture that for a projective klt log pair $(X,D)$ of absolute coregularity $c$ (and arbitrary dimension) the fundamental group $\pi_1^{\rm reg}(X,D)$ admits a normal abelian subgroup of finite index and rank at most $2c$. We prove this conjecture in the cases $0 \leq c \leq 3$, building on the almost abelianity of the fundamental groups of klt Calabi-Yau pairs of dimension $\leq 3$. In the cases $c \in \{0,1,2\}$ and fixed dimension, we can furthermore bound the index of a solvable normal subgroup. In dimension three, we are able to prove almost abelianity of the fundamental group of the regular locus for projective klt Calabi-Yau pairs.</description>

      <title>The intersection cohomology Hodge module of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <title>Park City lecture notes: around the inverse Galois problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse Galois problem asks whether any finite group can be realised as the Galois group of a Galois extension of the rationals. This problem and its refinements have stimulated a large amount of research in number theory and algebraic geometry in the past century, ranging from Noether's problem (letting X denote the quotient of the affine space by a finite group acting linearly, when is X rational?) to the rigidity method (if X is not rational, does it at least contain interesting rational curves?) and to the arithmetic of unirational varieties (if all else fails, does X at least contain interesting rational points?). The goal of the present notes, which formed the basis for three lectures given at the Park City Mathematics Institute in August 2022, is to provide an introduction to these topics.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma for the spherical Hecke algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hecke correspondences and Hecke operators on unitary RZ spaces and study their basic geometric properties, including a commutativity conjecture on Hecke operators. Then we formulate the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma conjecture for the spherical Hecke algebra. We also formulate a conjecture on the abundance of spherical Hecke functions with identically vanishing first derivative of orbital integrals. We prove these conjectures for the case $U(1)\times U(2)$.</description>

      <title>Telescope conjecture via homological residue fields with applications to schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a big tt-category, we give a characterization of the Telescope Conjecture (TC) in terms of definable tensor-ideals generated by homological residue fields. We formulate a stalk-locality property of (TC) and prove that it holds in the case of the derived category of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, strengthening a result \cite{HHZ21}. As an application, we find strong links between (TC) and separation properties of the adic topology on local rings. This allows us to recover known examples and counterexamples of when (TC) holds over a scheme, as well as to construct some new ones.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bruhat order on (0,1)-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorially and the geometrically defined partial orders on the set of permutations coincide. We extend this result to $(0,1)$-matrices with fixed row and column sums. Namely, the Bruhat order induced by the geometry of a Cherkis bow variety of type A coincides with one of the two combinatorially defined Bruhat orders on the same set.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Categorical Generalized Langlands Program I: Mixed-Parity Modules and Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-parity module emerges for instance when a de Rham Galois representation is being tensored with a square root of cyclotomic character, which produces half odd integers as the corresponding Hodge-Tate weights. We build the whole foundation on the $p$-adic Hodge theory in this setting over small $v$-stacks after Scholze and we also consider certain moduli $v$-stack which parametrizes families of mixed-parity Hodge modules. Examples of the small $v$-stacks in our mind are rigid analytic spaces over $p$-adic fields and moduli $v$-stack of vector bundles over Fargues-Fontaine curves. The preparation implemented at this level will be expected to provide further essential foundationalization for generalized Langlands program after Langlands, Drinfeld, Fargues-Scholze. One side of the generalized Langlands correspondence in the geometric setting is the perverse motivic derived $\infty$-category over $\mathrm{Moduli}_G$ related to smooth representations of reductive groups, while the other side of the generalized Langlands correspondence in the geometric setting is the corresponding derived $\infty$-category over the stack of mixed-parity $L$-parametrizations (i.e. from two-fold covering of the Weil group into $\ell$-adic groups) related to the representations of Weil group in our setting into Langlands dual groups. Although after Scholze and Fargues-Scholze our generalized Langlands program can go along $\ell$-adic cohomologicalization to immediately achieve various solid derived $\infty$-categories $\mathrm{DerCat}_\text{\'et}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$, $\mathrm{DerCat}_\mathrm{lisse, \blacksquare}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$, $\mathrm{DerCat}_{\blacksquare}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$ and so on with well-established formalism regarding 6-functors, we already provide certain $p$-adic cohomologicalization of the story over $\mathrm{Moduli}_G$.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Geometry of Reflexive Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for statistical models defined by reflexive polytopes. Our focus is on the maximum likelihood degree of these models as an algebraic measure of complexity of the corresponding optimization problem. We compute the ML degrees of all 4319 classes of three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and observe some surprising behavior in terms of the presence of gaps between ML degrees and degrees of the associated toric varieties. We interpret these drops in the context of discriminants and prove formulas for the ML degree for families of reflexive polytopes, including the hypercube and its dual, the cross polytope, in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine a family of embeddings for the $d$-cube that implies ML degree one. Finally, we discuss generalized constructions of families of reflexive polytopes in terms of their ML degrees.</description>

      <title>Equivariant formality in complex-oriented theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of unitary groups and let $(M,\omega)$ be a compact symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian $G$-action. We prove an equivariant formality result for any complex-oriented cohomology theory $\mathbb{E}^*$ (in particular, integral cohomology). This generalizes the celebrated result of Atiyah-Bott-Kirwan for rational cohomology from the 1980s. The proof does not use classical ideas but instead relies on a recent cohomological splitting result of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith for Hamiltonian fibrations over $\mathbb{CP}^1.$ Moreover, we establish analogues of the "localization" and "injectivity to fixed points" theorems for certain cohomology theories studied by Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. As an application of these results, we establish a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson theorem with Morava $K$-theory coefficients for Hamiltonian $T$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>
