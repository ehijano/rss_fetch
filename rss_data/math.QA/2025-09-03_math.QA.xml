      <title>Cyclic $\mathcal{U}_\xi(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules and invariants of knots with flat $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ connections in the complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the factorization of the holonomy $R$-matrix for quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at a root of unity into a product of four quantum holonomy dilogarithms. This factorization extends previously known results in this direction. We collect many existing results needed for the factorization. We use the holonomy $R$-matrices to define representations of a groupoid of braids with flat $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ connections, which also define invariants of knots with such connections.</description>

      <title>A quantization of the $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-Chern-Simons invariant of tangle exteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of the author and Reshetikhin shows how to use modules over the unrestricted quantum group (at a root of unity) to define quantum representations of a groupoid of braids with flat $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ connections on their complements, equivalently $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ representations or hyperbolic structures. In this article we explain how to use these representations to define quantum invariants $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ of tangles and links with such geometric structures. Unlike previous constructions of geometric quantum invariants $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ is defined without any phase ambiguity. We interpret $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ as a quantization of the $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$-Chern-Simons invariant $\mathcal{I}$. It is natural to conjecture that $\mathcal{Z}_{N}$ is related to the quantization of Chern-Simons theory with complex, noncompact gauge group $\operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ and we discuss how to interpret our results in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify modular fusion categories up to braided equivalence with less than four distinct twists of simple objects by observing that under this assumption, for each positive integer $N$, there are finitely many modular fusion categories of Frobenius-Schur exponent $N$ up to braided equivalence whose twists are a proper subset of the $N^\mathrm{th}$ roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Anchored Planar Algebras and 3-Categorical Graphical Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anchored planar algebras, a generalized notion of Vaughan Jones' planar algebras, have recently seen use in higher category theory, functional analysis, and TQFT applications. These algebras are equipped with a natural 3-dimensional graphical calculus. We compare this graphical calculus with the 3-dimensional graphical calculus associated to tricategories, and we show that anchored planar algebras can be thought of as living in a particular tricategory. This allows for more general techniques to be applied to anchored planar algebras and expands the types of diagrams that anchored planar algebras can interpret.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional modules over associative equivariant map algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ be an affine scheme and (respectively) a finite-dimensional associative algebra over an algebraically-closed field $\Bbbk$, both equipped with actions by a linearly-reductive linear algebraic group $G$. We describe the simple finite-dimensional modules over the algebra of $G$-equivariant maps $X\to \mathfrak{a}$ in terms of the representation theory of the fixed-point subalgebras $\mathfrak{a}^x:=\mathfrak{a}^{G_x}\le \mathfrak{a}$, $G_x$ being the respective isotropy groups of closed-orbit $k$-points $x\in X$. This answers a question of E. Neher and A. Savage, extending an analogous result for (also linearly-reductive) finite-group actions. Moreover, the full category of finite-dimensional modules admits a direct-sum decomposition indexed by closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Generalized theta functions, projectively flat vector bundles and noncommutative tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-known relationship between theta functions and Heisenberg group actions thereon is resumed by combining complex algebraic and noncommutative geometric techniques in that we describe Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori via representations of noncommutative tori, thereby reconstructing Matsushima's setup and elucidating the ensuing Fourier-Mukai-Nahm (FMN) aspects. We prove the existence of noncommutative torus actions on the space of smooth sections of Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori preserving the eigenspaces of a natural Laplace operator. Motivated by the Coherent State Transform approach to theta functions, we extend the latter to vector valued thetas and develop an additional algebraic reinterpretation of Matsushima's theory making FMN-duality manifest again.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Grothendieck ring of the monoidal category of finitely generated graded projective modules for the nil-Brauer category is isomorphic to an integral form of the split iquantum group of rank one. Under this isomorphism, the indecomposable graded projective modules correspond to the icanonical basis. We also derive character formulae for irreducible graded modules and deduce various branching rules.</description>

      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the modules over the internal skein algebras are generated by one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Correlators in Finite Rigid Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article applies to the open-closed sector and generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients obtained by the evaluation of the torus partition function at projective objects are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Odd Grassmannian bimodules and derived equivalences for spin symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove odd analogs of results of Chuang and Rouquier on sl(2)-categorification. Combined also with recent work of the second author with Livesey, this allows us to complete the proof of Brou\'e's Abelian Defect Conjecture for the double covers of symmetric groups. The article also develops the theory of odd symmetric functions initiated a decade ago by Ellis, Khovanov and Lauda. A key role in our approach is played by a 2-category consisting of odd Grassmannian bimodules over superalgebras which are odd analogs of equivariant cohomology algebras of Grassmannians. This is the odd analog of the category of Grassmannian bimodules which was at the heart of Lauda's independent approach to categorification of sl(2). We also construct an action of the odd Kac-Moody 2-category of sl(2) on the 2-category of odd Grassmannian bimodules, and use this to give a new proof of its non-degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Balanced multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the balanced multiple q-zeta values. They give a new model for multiple q-zeta values, whose product formula combines the shuffle and stuffle product for multiple zeta values in a natural way. Moreover, the balanced multiple q-zeta values are invariant under a very explicit involution. Thus, all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a very simple shape. Examples of the balanced multiple q-zeta values are the classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple Eisenstein series. The construction of the balanced multiple q-zeta values is done on the level of generating series. We introduce a general setup relating Hoffman's quasi-shuffle products to explicit symmetries among generating series of words, which gives a clarifying approach to Ecalle's theory of bimoulds. This allows us to obtain an isomorphism between the underlying Hopf algebras of words related to the combinatorial bi-multiple Eisenstein series and the balanced multiple q-zeta values.</description>

      <title>A generalization of formal multiple zeta values related to multiple Eisenstein series and multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $\tau$-invariant balanced quasi-shuffle algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$, whose elements formalize (combinatorial) multiple Eisenstein series as well as multiple q-zeta values. In particular, $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ has natural maps into these two algebras, and we expect these maps to be isomorphisms. Racinet studied the algebra $\mathcal{Z}^f$ of formal multiple zeta values by examining the corresponding affine scheme DM. Similarly, we present the affine scheme BM corresponding to the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$. We show that Racinet's affine scheme DM embeds into our affine scheme BM. This leads to a projection from the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ onto $\mathcal{Z}^f$. Via the above natural maps, this projection corresponds to extracting the constant terms of multiple Eisenstein series or the limit $q\to1$ of multiple q-zeta values.</description>

Abstract: We study the density of the Burau representation from the perspective of a non-semisimple TQFT at a fourth root of unity. This gives a TQFT construction of Squier's Hermitian form on the Burau representation with possibly mixed signature. We prove that the image of the braid group in the space of possibly indefinite unitary representations is dense. We also argue for the potential applications of non-semisimple TQFTs toward topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified free field realization of representations for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ with arbitrary levels, constructed using six free boson fields. This realization arises from a specialized factorization of the structure function within the defining relations of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$. Utilizing this free field realization, we further develop intertwining operators for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$.</description>

      <title>Closed Formulas for $\eta$-Corrections in the Once Punctured Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\eta$-correction terms in the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the once-punctured torus $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$. While the Frohman-Gelca product-to-sum rule is explicit on the closed torus, punctures introduce correction terms in the ideal $(\eta)$ whose structure has resisted systematic description beyond low-determinant cases. We give a closed form for the family $P_n=(1,0)\cdot T_n((1,2))$: the correction $\epsilon_n$ has an explicit Chebyshev expansion with coefficients that factor as geometric sums in $t^{\pm4}$ governed by parity. Tracking creation and cancellation of $\eta$ through the Chebyshev recurrence, and using diffeomorphism invariance, the formula transports to all products $C_1\cdot T_k(C_2)$ with $|\det(C_1,C_2)|=2$.
  We further treat the \emph{primitive maximal-thread} regime, where one Frohman-Gelca summand is fully threaded and the other is simple or doubly covered. In this case we obtain a closed form for the discrepancy: an $\eta$-linear cascade with Chebyshev $S$-coefficients that lowers the thread degree by two at each step. Equivalently, in this maximal-thread regime we solve the specialized Wang-Wong recursion in closed form; the coefficients match their fast algorithm term-by-term (up to the $T_0$ normalization) and subsume Cho's $|\det|=2$ case. The resulting rules give compact, scalable formulas for symbolic multiplication in $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$.</description>
