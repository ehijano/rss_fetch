      <title>Cowen-Douglas operators on quaternionic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1978, M. J. Cowen and R. G. Douglas introduced a class of geometric operators (known as Cowen-Douglas class of operators) and associated a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle to such operators. In this paper, after giving some basic properties of $S$-spectrum and right eigenvalues of bounded right linear operators on separable quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we generalize the class of Cowen-Douglas operators to the quaternionic Hilbert space via the $S$-spectrum and denote this class as $B_n^s(\Omega_q)$. Due to the lack of commutativity of quaternion multiplication, the quaternionic Cowen-Douglas operators are not trivial generalizations of the classical Cowen-Douglas operators. Each operator in $B_n^{s}(\Omega_q)$ corresponds to an $n$-dimensional Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundle. We first establish a rigidity theorem for Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundles. It is then proven that two operators in $B_n^{s}(\Omega_q)$ are quaternion unitarily equivalent if and only if the associate bundles are equivalent as Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundles. In particular, we introduce canonical matrix representations of operators in $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ and furthermore, we give the quaternion unitarily equivalent classification of $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ by the canonical matrix representations. It is worth noting that curvature is a complete unitary invariant for the classical (complex) Cowen-Douglas operators, however, there exist two quaternionic Cowen-Douglas operators which have the same curvature but are not quaternion unitarily equivalent. In addition, we prove that the operators in $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ are quaternion unitarily equivalent if and only if their complex representations are unitarily equivalent. Some relevant examples of the above results are also provided.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Toeplitz Operators with $BMO^1_{\alpha}$ operator-valued symbols on $\ell^2-$Valued Bergman Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a class of compact operators on the $\ell^2-$valued Bergman space $A^2_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \ell^2)$ on the unit ball $\mathbb B_n,$ we study Toeplitz operators with $BMO^1_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \mathcal L(\ell^2))$ operator-valued symbols. First, we describe a method of restriction to a finite dimension which allows us to apply earlier results of Rahm and Wick; then we exhibit an explicit example of a compact Toeplitz operator on $A^2_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \ell^2).$ Secondly, we apply two sufficient conditions for compactness established by Rahm in infinite dimension. The first condition is in terms of the Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal T_{L^\infty_{fin}},$ the second one is in terms of sufficiently localized operators and is implied by the first condition. To get the second condition, we additionally assume that the symbol and its adjoint belong to $BMO^1_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \mathcal L(\ell^2, \ell^1)).$ Finally, inspired by Xia and Sadeghi-Zorboska, we ask the question of the validity of the reverse implication.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of algebras and $C^*$-algebras of self-similar groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many previously studied path algebras or self-similar group algebras may be viewed as Steinberg algebras of self-similar groupoids. By way of inverse semigroup algebras, we characterize when the Steinberg algebra of a self-similar groupoid is simple. We show that the simplicity of the reduced $C^*$-algebra of a contracting self-similar groupoid coincides with the simplicity of the Steinberg algebra. As an aside, we show that simplicity of the two algebras sometimes depends only on the skeleton of the self-similar groupoid acting on a strongly connected graph. Finally, we apply our methods to examples including a self-similar groupoid akin to multispinal self-similar groups and a self-similar groupoid built from the well-known Basilica group.</description>

      <title>New hyperfinite subfactors with infinite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new hyperfinite subfactors with Temperley-Lieb-Jones (TLJ) standard invariant and Jones indices between $4$ and $3 + \sqrt{5}$. Our subfactors occur at all indices between $4$ and $5$ at which finite depth, hyperfinite subfactors exist. The presence of hyperfinite subfactors with TLJ standard invariant, and hence of infinite depth, at these special indices comes as a surprise. In particular, we obtain the first example of a hyperfinite subfactor with ``trivial'' (i.e. TLJ) standard invariant and integer index $&gt;4$, namely with index $5$. This is achieved by constructing explicit families of nondegenerate commuting squares of multi-matrix algebras based on exotic inclusion graphs with appropriate norms. We employ our graph planar algebra embedding theorem [BC25], a result of Kawahigashi [Kaw23] and other techniques to determine that the resulting commuting square subfactors have indeed TLJ standard invariant.
  We also show the existence of a hyperfinite subfactor with trivial standard invariant and index $3 + \sqrt{5}$. It is interesting that this index features at least two distinct infinite depth, irreducible hyperfinite subfactors and several finite depth ones as well. Our work leads to the conjecture that every Jones index $&gt;4$ of an irreducible, hyperfinite (finite depth) subfactor can be realized by one with TLJ standard invariant.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Block structures of graphs and quantum isomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every pair of quantum isomorphic graphs, their block trees and their block graphs are isomorphic, and that such an isomorphism can be chosen so that the corresponding blocks are quantum isomorphic -- in particular, 2-connectedness is preserved under quantum isomorphism. We conclude with some corollaries, including obtaining some necessary conditions on a pair of quantum isomorphic, not isomorphic graphs with a minimal number of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit several bounds for operator norms of the sum of $\epsilon$-free semicircular random variables introduced in the paper of Speicher and Wysocza\'{n}ski. In particular, using the first and second largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $\epsilon$, we show analogs of the operator-valued Khintchine-type inequality obtained by Haagerup and Pisier.</description>
