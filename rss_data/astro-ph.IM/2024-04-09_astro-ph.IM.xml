      <title>Sen2Chain: An Open-Source Toolbox for Processing Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Producing Time-Series of Spectral Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of free high-resolution earth observation data covering any point on the globe every few days led to the emergence of new remote sensing tools that can manipulate the very large volumes of data generated by those satellites. We present Sen2Chain, an open-source Python tool that can automate the processing of large time series of Sentinel-2 images for their use in various fields (e.g., environmental health, natural hazards, ecology). Sen2Chain allows downloading images from various earth observation data suppliers, applying geometric and atmospheric corrections using ESA's Sen2Cor tool, and generating and applying cloud masks. Sen2Chain's ability to extract time series of spectral indices (e.g NDVI, NDWI) provides simplified access to value-added environmental information for a wide range of end-users and applications. Sen2Chain enables all data processing stages to be customized and chained together, with the possibility to automate and parallelize the processing, and optimize data management. Sen2Chain is paving the way for the creation and processing of a large earth observation image database dedicated to users who require time-series and/or perform regular environmental observations. The Web tool Sen2Extract is also presented, which enables end-users with no expertise in remote sensing to easily extract time-series for 11 spectral indices values for specific regions of interest.</description>

      <title>Galaxy 3D Shape Recovery using Mixture Density Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the turn of the century, astronomers have been exploiting the rich information afforded by combining stellar kinematic maps and imaging in an attempt to recover the intrinsic, three-dimensional (3D) shape of a galaxy. A common intrinsic shape recovery method relies on an expected monotonic relationship between the intrinsic misalignment of the kinematic and morphological axes and the triaxiality parameter. Recent studies have, however, cast doubt about underlying assumptions relating shape and intrinsic kinematic misalignment. In this work, we aim to recover the 3D shape of individual galaxies using their projected stellar kinematic and flux distributions using a supervised machine learning approach with mixture density network (MDN). Using a mock dataset of the EAGLE hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, we train the MDN model for a carefully selected set of common kinematic and photometric parameters. Compared to previous methods, we demonstrate potential improvements achieved with the MDN model to retrieve the 3D galaxy shape along with the uncertainties, especially for prolate and triaxial systems. We make specific recommendations for recovering galaxy intrinsic shapes relevant for current and future integral field spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Technical Noise, Data Quality, and Calibration Requirements for Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers is expected to generate a bounty of new astrophysical discoveries, with sensitivities and bandwidths greatly improved compared to current-generation detectors. These detectors will allow us to make exceptional advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, the dynamics of dense matter, and the cosmic history of compact objects. The fundamental design aspects of these planned interferometers will enable these new discoveries; however, challenges in technical noise, data quality, and calibration have the potential to limit the scientific reach of these instruments. In this work, we evaluate the requirements of these elements for next-generation gravitational-wave science, focusing on how these areas may impact the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory. We highlight multiple aspects of these fields where additional research and development is required to ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches its full potential.</description>

      <title>LHAASO-KM2A detector simulation using Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KM2A is one of the main sub-arrays of LHAASO, working on gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics at energies above 10 TeV. Detector simulation is the important foundation for estimating detector performance and data analysis. It is a big challenge to simulate the KM2A detector in the framework of Geant4 due to the need to track numerous photons from a large number of detector units (&gt;6000) with large altitude difference (30 m) and huge coverage (1.3 km^2). In this paper, the design of the KM2A simulation code G4KM2A based on Geant4 is introduced. The process of G4KM2A is optimized mainly in memory consumption to avoid memory overffow. Some simpliffcations are used to signiffcantly speed up the execution of G4KM2A. The running time is reduced by at least 30 times compared to full detector simulation. The particle distributions and the core/angle resolution comparison between simulation and experimental data of the full KM2A array are also presented, which show good agreement.</description>

      <title>Bright Star Subtraction Pipeline for LSST: Progress Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Bright Star Subtraction (BSS) pipeline for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This pipeline generates an extended PSF model using observed stars and subtracts the model from the bright stars in LSST data. When testing the pipeline on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, we find that the shape of the extended PSF model depends on the location of the detector on the camera's focal plane. The closer a detector is to the edge of the focal plane, the less the extended PSF model is circularly symmetric. We introduce an algorithm that allows the user to consider the location dependency of the model.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Australian MWA EoR pipeline I: 21-cm sky model and correlated measurement density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first of two papers dedicated to verifying the Australian Epoch of Reionisation pipeline (AusEoRPipe) through simulation. The AusEoRPipe aims to disentangle 21-cm radiation emitted by gas surrounding the very first stars from contaminating foreground astrophysical sources, and has been in development for close to a decade. In this paper, we build an accurate 21-cm sky model that can be used by the WODEN simulation software to create visibilities containing a predictable 21-cm signal. We verify that the power spectrum estimator CHIPS can recover this signal in the absence of foregrounds. We also investigate how measurements in Fourier-space are correlated, and how their gridded density affects the power spectrum. We measure and fit for this effect using Gaussian-noise simulations of the MWA phase I layout. We find a gridding density correction factor of 2.651 appropriate for integrations equal to or greater than 30 minutes of data, which contain observations with multiple primary beam pointings and LSTs. Paper II of this series will use the results of this paper to test the AusEoRPipe in the presence of foregrounds and instrumental effects.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the ESPRESSO Line-Spread Function and Improvement of the Wavelength Calibration Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a truly accurate wavelength calibration of high-dispersion echelle spectrographs is a challenging task but crucially needed for certain science cases, e.g. to test for a possible variation of the fine-structure constant in quasar spectra. One of the spectrographs best suited for this mission is VLT/ESPRESSO. Nevertheless, previous studies have identified significant discrepancies between the classical wavelength solutions and the one derived independently from the laser frequency comb. The dominant parts of these systematics were intra-order distortions, most-likely related to a deviation of the instrumental line-spread function from the assumed Gaussian shape. Here, we therefore present a study focused on a detailed modeling of the ESPRESSO instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate that it is strongly asymmetric, non-Gaussian, different for the two slices and fibers, and varies significantly along the spectral orders. Incorporating the determined non-parametric model in the wavelength calibration process drastically improves the wavelength calibration accuracy, reducing the discrepancies between the two independent wavelength solutions from 50m/s to about 10m/s. The most striking success is, however, that the different fibers and slices now provide fully consistent measurements with a scatter of just a couple m/s. This demonstrates that the instrument-related systematics can be nearly eliminated over most of the spectral range by properly taking into account the complex shape of the instrumental line-spread function and paves the way for further optimizations of the wavelength calibration process.</description>

      <title>Comparative Image Alignment for Multiple Telescopes: ALMA, IRIS, SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for aligning solar observations from different telescopes. We utilized helioprojective coordinates from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as a reference to align images from ALMA and IRIS. The alignment is based on correlation analysis, employing both the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for assessing data correlations. PCC was preferred for its effectiveness with diverse datasets and its computational efficiency compared to SSIM. The alignment demonstrated less than 1.0\,arcsec variation in average centers between the two methods, ensuring consistent results. We illustrate this method using ALMA observations, labeled D06 in the Solar ALMA Science Archive (SALSA), as a case study.</description>

      <title>Tracing the evolving X-ray reverberation lags within an individual AGN light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Granger causality (GC) test for the X-ray reverberation analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). If the light curves in the continuum-dominated band help predict (Granger cause) those dominated by reflection, the Granger lags that associate to the intrinsic reverberation lags can be inferred. We focus on six AGN observed by XMM-Newton, including the sources well-known to exhibit clear X-ray reverberation lags (IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495) and those in which reverberation signatures are not well confirmed (MCG-6-30-15, IZW1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040). We employ the sliding-window algorithm and estimate the Granger (intrinsic) Fe-L lags along the light curve as the window moves through. This reveals the evolving lags towards the end of some individual observations, suggesting that the corona varies progressively. Occasionally, we observe two clearly separate lags that suggest an extended corona consisting of two zones while producing competing reverberation of two lags. While the GC test is purely hypothetical and might not explain true causality, our conclusion is that the lags are present and could be understood as reverberation lags. Assuming the lags changing solely with the corona, we find that the IRAS 13224-3809 corona varies between $\sim 10$-$25$ $r_{\rm g}$ and sometimes move to $\gtrsim 50$ $r_{\rm g}$. The corona of 1H 0707-495 and MCG-6-30-15 may be analogous to that of IRAS 13224-3809, while in IZw1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040 a more compact corona is expected.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Exoplanetary Transits</title>

Abstract: Transit photometry is currently the most efficient and sensitive method for detecting extrasolar planets (exoplanets) and a large majority of confirmed exoplanets have been detected with this method. The substantial success of space-based missions such as NASA's Kepler/K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has generated a large and diverse sample of confirmed and candidate exoplanets. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) provides a useful tool for studying photometric time series and exoplanetary transits. SSA is a technique for decomposing a time series into a sum of its main components, where each component is a separate time series that incorporates specific information from the behavior of the initial time series. SSA can be implemented for extracting important information (such as main trends and signals) from the photometry data or reducing the noise factors. The detectability and accurate characterization of an exoplanetary transit signal is principally determined by its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Stellar variability of the host star, small planet to star radius ratio, background noises from other sources in the field of observations and instrumental noise can cause lower SNRs and consequently, more complexities or inaccuracies in the modeling of the transit signals, which in turn leads to the inaccurate inference of the astrophysical parameters of the planetary object. Therefore, implementing SSA leads to a more accurate characterization of exoplanetary transits and is also capable of detecting transits with low SNRs ($SNR&lt;10$). In this paper, after discussing the principles and properties of SSA, we investigate its applications for studying photometric transit data and detecting low SNR exoplanet candidates.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent and Robust Newton-Raphson Method: A New Dawn in Primitive Variable Recovery for Relativistic MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be "robust, accurate, and fast -- it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes," as emphasized in [S.C. Noble et al., ApJ, 641:626-637, 2006]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem.
  This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton-Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical "safe" interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this interval. Our PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bandpasses for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Ricci-Notation Tensor Framework for Model-based Approaches to Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based approaches to imaging, like specialized image enhancements in astronomy, facilitate explanations of relationships between observed inputs and computed outputs. These models may be expressed with extended matrix-vector (EMV) algebra, especially when they involve only scalars, vectors, and matrices, and with n-mode or index notations, when they involve multidimensional arrays, also called numeric tensors or, simply, tensors. While this paper features an example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that employs tensors to reveal (inverse) 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising a dual-variant index notation, with Einstein summation convention, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency via careful design of numeric tensor and dual-variant index classes. Compared to its closest competitor, also a numeric tensor framework that uses index notation, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiple timestep reversible $N$-body integrators for close encounters in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new almost time-reversible integrators for solution of planetary systems consisting of "planets" and a dominant mass ("star"). The algorithms can be considered adaptive generalizations of the Wisdom--Holman method, in which all pairs of planets can be assigned timesteps. These timesteps, along with the global timestep, can be adapted time-reversibly, often at no appreciable additional compute cost, without sacrificing any of the long-term error benefits of the Wisdom--Holman method. The method can also be considered a simpler and more flexible version of the \texttt{SYMBA} symplectic code. We perform tests on several challenging problems with close encounters and find the reversible algorithms are up to $2.6$ times faster than a code based on \texttt{SYMBA}. The codes presented here are available on Github. We also find adapting a global timestep reversibly and discretely must be done in block-synchronized manner or similar.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>
