      <title>Short- and long-term avalanche dynamics in 1D-printed microfluidic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report arrays of monodisperse water-in-oil microdroplets printed onto a substrate in a form of a compact linear chain -- a 1D-crystal -- pinned at one end. The chain spontaneously collapses under capillary forces via a sequence of avalanche-like rearrangement waves, resembling the rearrangements in a flowing microfluidic crystal, yet limited by the hydrodynamic friction at the substrate. While the propagation of the subsequent waves, separated by highly ordered metastable states, is either accelerating or decelerating depending on the direction of collapse, the coarse-grained dynamics of multiple waves -- at moderate packing fractions $\phi$ -- is initially linear in time, before leveling off. We further demonstrate how the collapse can be prevented via the use of a roughened substrate. Our study provides insight into the short- and long-term avalanche dynamics in granular systems with free interfaces and opens way to precision-printing of microfluidic assays.</description>

      <title>Jamming Crossovers in a Confined Driven Polymer in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use lattice-Boltzmann molecular dynamics (LBMD) simulations to study the compression of a confined polymer immersed in a fluid and pushed by a large spherical colloid with a diameter comparable to the channel width. We examined the chain's deformation with both purely repulsive and weakly attractive Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials applied between the monomers. The sphere's velocity was varied over 3 orders of magnitude. The chain is in a non-dense state at low pushing velocities for both repulsive and attractive monomer interactions. When the velocity of the spherical colloid exceeds a threshold $v^*$, the back end of the chain transitions to a high density state with low mean square monomer displacement (MSD) values. The front end, however, remains in a non-dense state with high MSD indicating a pseudo two-state coexistence. This crossover is also revealed through volume per monomer and MSD as a function of the sphere's velocity. We also studied polymer dynamics by investigating folding events at different times.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for Pluripotency in Metamaterial Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From self-assembly and protein folding to combinatorial metamaterials, a key challenge in material design is finding the right combination of interacting building blocks that yield targeted properties. Such structures are fiendishly difficult to find; not only are they rare, but often the design space is so rough that gradients are useless and direct optimization is hopeless. Here, we design ultra rare combinatorial metamaterials capable of multiple desired deformations by introducing a two-fold strategy that avoids the drawbacks of direct optimization. We first combine convolutional neural networks with genetic algorithms to prospect for metamaterial designs with a potential for high performance. In our case, these metamaterials have a high number of spatially extended modes; they are pluripotent. Second, we exploit this library of pluripotent designs to generate metamaterials with multiple target deformations, which we finally refine by strategically placing defects. Our pluripotent, multishape metamaterials would be impossible to design through trial-and-error or standard optimization. Instead, our data-driven approach is systematic and ideally suited to tackling the large and intractable combinatorial problems that are pervasive in material science.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Planar Clamped-Free Elastic Rods from Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slender structures, such as rods, often exhibit large nonlinear geometrical deformations even under moderate external forces (e.g., gravity). This characteristic results in a rich variety of morphological changes, making them appealing for engineering design and applications, such as soft robots, submarine cables, decorative knots, and more. Prior studies have demonstrated that the natural shape of a rod significantly influences its deformed geometry. Consequently, the natural shape of the rod should be considered when manufacturing and designing rod-like structures. Here, we focus on an inverse problem: can we determine the natural shape of a suspended 2D planar rod so that it deforms into a desired target shape? We begin by formulating a theoretical framework based on the statics of planar rod equilibrium that can compute the natural shape of a planar rod given its target shape. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of uncertainties (e.g., noise in the data) on the accuracy of the theoretical framework. The results reveal the shortcomings of the theoretical framework in handling uncertainties in the inverse problem, a fact often overlooked in previous works. To mitigate the influence of the uncertainties, we combine the statics of the planar rod with the adjoint method for parameter sensitivity analysis, constructing a learning framework that can efficiently explore the natural shape of the designed rod with enhanced robustness. This framework is validated numerically for its accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into the inverse design of soft structures for various applications, including soft robotics and animation of morphing structures.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained dynamic gel swelling generates transient surface deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer gels are comprised of a three-dimensional, cross-linked network that can typically withstand the mechanical deformation associated with both swelling and de-swelling. Thus, gels can be designed with smart behaviors that require both stress generation and dissipation, making them well-suited to many applications including membrane technology, water capture devices, and drug delivery systems. In contrast to the fully swelled equilibrium state, limited research characterizes the unsteady-state swelling regime prior to equilibrium. It is in this regime where unique surface deformations can occur. Here we show how internal network constraints and external diffusive pressure can be leveraged to manipulate swelling kinetics and surface deformations in poly(ethylene glycol) gels during unconstrained, three-dimensional swelling. We find that increasing cross-linker molecular weight and swelling in ethanol, as opposed to water, are both effective routes to increase the time it takes to reach equilibrium but do so through different mechanisms. Networks with fewer internal constraints, manipulated via cross-linker chain-length, imbibe more solvent over a longer time. In contrast, swelling in ethanol reduces the amount of solvent imbibed by the network while increasing the time to reach equilibrium. Measurements of surface patterns during swelling establishes that an immediate, fast relaxation at the surface occurs during the first five minutes of swelling. However, the density and persistence of these features varies with solvent quality. These results serve establish a framework for how soft materials undergo dynamic deformation. Engineering transient surface properties while mitigating unwanted instabilities opens the door for emerging technologies such as smart anti-fouling and sensors.</description>

      <title>HTMPC: A heavily templated C++ library for large scale particle-based mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations using multiparticle collision dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HTMPC, a Heavily Templated C++ library for large-scale simulations implementing multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC), a particle-based mesoscale hydrodynamic simulation method. The implementation is plugin-based, and designed for distributed computing over an arbitrary number of MPI ranks. By abstracting the hardware-dependent parts of the implementation, we provide an identical application-code base for various architectures, currently supporting CPUs and CUDA-capable GPUs. We have examined the code for a system of more than a trillion MPC particles distributed over a few thousand MPI ranks (GPUs), demonstrating the scalability of the implementation and its applicability to large-scale hydrodynamic simulations. As showcases, we examine passive and active suspension of colloids, which confirms the extensibility and versatility of our plugin-based implementation.</description>

      <title>The random walk of intermittently self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory granular landslides are smaller-scale, simplified, yet well-controlled versions of larger and often tragic natural landslides. Using systematic experiments and scaling analysis, we quantify the influence of grain size, fall height, and landslide volume on runout distance. We also determine the minimum landslide size required to observe this scaling, which we find is set by a combination of air drag, grain size, and fall height.</description>

      <title>Features of heterogeneously charged systems at their liquid-liquid critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently synthesized colloids and biological systems such as proteins, viruses and monoclonal antibodies are heterogeneously charged, i.e., different regions of their surfaces carry different amount of positive or negative charge. Because of charge anisotropy, the electrostatics interactions between these units through the surrounding medium are intristically anisotropic, meaning that they are characterized not only by the attraction between oppositely-charged regions but also by the repulsion between like-charged areas. Recent experiments have shown that the liquid-liquid phase separation of these systems can be driven by anisotropic electrostatics interactions, but it is not clear how the emerging aggregates are affected by charge imbalance and charge patchiness. The ability to experimentally control these two quantities calls for a theoretical understanding of their interplay, which we address here at the critical point. We consider a coarse grained model of anisotropically charged hard spheres whose interaction potential is grounded in a robust mean field theory and perform extensive numerical Monte Carlo simulations to understand the aggregation behavior of these units at the critical point. Stemming from the simplicity of the model, we address the interplay between charge imbalance and charge patchiness with the use of three parameters only and fully rationalize how these features impact the critical point of the model by means of thermodynamic-independent pair properties.</description>

      <title>Breaking the angular dispersion limit in thin film optics by ultra-strong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin film interference is integral to modern photonics and optoelectronics, e.g. allowing for precise design of high performance optical filters1, efficiency enhancements in photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, as well as the realization of microlasers and high-performance photodetectors. However, interference inevitably leads to a change of spectral characteristics with angle, which is generally undesired and can limit the usefulness of thin-film coatings and devices. Here, we introduce a strategy to overcome this fundamental limit in optics by utilizing and tuning the exciton-polariton modes arising in ultra-strongly coupled microcavities. We demonstrate optical filters with narrow pass bands that shift by less than their half width (&lt;15 nm) even at extreme angles. Our filters cover the entire visible range and surpass comparable metal-dielectric-metal filters in all relevant metrics. By expanding this strategy to strong coupling with the photonic sidebands of dielectric multilayer stacks, we also obtain filters with high extinction ratios. Based on these findings, we realize ultrathin and flexible narrowband filter films, monolithically integrate our filters with organic photodiodes, and demonstrate polarization-sensitive polariton filters. These results illustrate how strong coupling provides additional degrees of freedom in thin film optics that will enable a multitude of exciting new applications in micro-optics, sensing, and biophotonics.</description>

      <title>Anti-Coulomb ion-ion interactions: a theoretical and computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the "anti-Coulomb" interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>

      <title>The interplay between liquid-liquid and ferroelectric phase transitions in supercooled water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of water, evident in its thermodynamic anomalies, have implications across disciplines from biology to geophysics. Considered a valid hypothesis to rationalize its unique properties, a liquid-liquid phase transition in water's supercooled regime has nowadays been observed in several molecular dynamics simulations and is being actively researched experimentally. Here, we highlight novel and far-reaching implications of water: the interplay between the liquid-liquid and a ferroelectric phase transition. Our results are based on the analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and are explained in the context of a classical density functional theory in mean-field approximation valid for a polar liquid. The theory underpins the potential role of ferroelectricity in promoting the liquid-liquid phase transition. The existence of ferroelectric order in supercooled low-density liquid water is confirmed by the observation in molecular dynamics simulations of collective modes in polarization fluctuations dynamics, traceable to spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. Our work opens the door to new experimental investigations of the static and dynamic behavior of water polarization.</description>

      <title>Neural density functionals: Local learning and pair-correlation matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arXiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023), doi:10.1073/pnas.2312484120]. While Dijkman et al. demonstrated pair-correlation matching of a global neural free energy functional, we argue in favor of local one-body learning for flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>
