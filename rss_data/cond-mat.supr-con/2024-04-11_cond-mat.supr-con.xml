      <title>Fermi sea and sky in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive logical framework for effectively handling the overcomplete basis set in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation that contains two orthonormal basis sets conjugate with each other, such as particle and hole orthonormal basis sets. We highlight the significant implications of our logical framework from theoretical concepts and experimental predictions. Firstly, we rigorously derive all many-body eigenfunctions of arbitrary nonuniform superconductors and uncover that the many-body eigenstates are full of superconducting spin clouds-the electron configuration within the Cooper-like pair of an arbitrary nonuniform superconductor. Secondly, we demonstrate a conjugate loop formed by the effective vacuum states of two orthonormal basis sets conjugate with each other, such as the Fermi sea and sky-the effective vacuum states of positive and negative orthonormal basis sets, respectively. Thirdly, we present a gate-, field-, and phase-tunable tunnel spectroscopy asymmetry arising from the imbalanced particle-hole distribution of the subgap quasiparticles in a quantum-dot Josephson junction. These findings underscore the power of our logical framework and its implications for advancing our understanding and utilization of solid-state devices based on superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Flexible Control of Chiral Superconductivity in Optically Driven Nodal Point Superconductors with Antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have attracted widespread attention on magnet-superconductor hybrid systems with emergent topological superconductivity. Here, we present the Floquet engineering of realistic two-dimensional topological nodal-point superconductors that are composed of antiferromagnetic monolayers in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. We show that Floquet chiral topological superconductivity arises naturally due to light-induced breaking of the effective time-reversal symmetry. More strikingly, we find that the Floquet chiral topological superconducting phases can be flexibly controlled by irradiating elliptically polarized light, with the photon-dressed quasi-energy spectrum carrying different Chern numbers. Such optically switchable topological transition is attributed to the simultaneous creations (or annihilations) of valley pairs. Our findings provide a feasible approach for achieving the Floquet chiral topological superconductivity with flexible tunability, which would draw extensive attention in experiments.</description>

      <title>Variational Improvement of the Hartree-Fock Approach to the 2D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04777v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a refinement of the usual Hartree-Fock method applied the 2D Hubbard model, in Nambu spinor formulation. The new element is the addition of a ''condensate inducing'' term proportional to a variational parameter h to the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which generates an s- or d-wave condensate. This modified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is used only to generate variational trial states; energy expectation values are computed in the full two-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian with no modification. It is found that there exist trial states with non-vanishing condensates that are significantly lower in energy than the standard Hartree-Fock ground states, in some range of the U/t-density plane.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the mean-field model of a one-dimensional topological superconductor with two orbitals per unit cell. Time-reversal symmetry is absent, but a nonsymmorphic symmetry, involving a translation by a fraction of the unit cell, mimics the role of time-reversal symmetry. As a result, the topological superconductor has $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, two which support Majorana bound states and two which do not, in agreement with a prediction based on K-theory classification [K. Shiozaki et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 195413 (2016)]. As with the Kitaev chain, the presence of Majorana bound states gives rise to the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. The K-theory classification describes two $\mathbb{Z}_4$ subclasses, but, by identifying models in both subclasses, we show that they are related by a unitary transformation and are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry and superconducting domes in (111) oxide interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and discuss some of the implications for the $\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. From a tight-binding modeling of the interface, we derive a two-band low-energy model, allowing us to analytically compute the quantum geometry and giving us access to the superfluid weight, as well as to showcase the role of two particular relevant energy scales. One is given by the trigonal crystal field which stems from the local trigonal symmetry at the interface, and the other one is due to orbital mixing at the interface. Our calculations indicate that the variation of the superfluid weight with the chemical potential $\mu$ is controlled by the quantum geometry in the low-$\mu$ limit where it presents a dome. At higher values of $\mu$ the conventional contribution dominates. In order to make quantitative comparisons between our results and experimental findings, we rely on an experimentally observed global reduction of the superfluid weight that we apply to both the conventional and geometric contributions. Furthermore, an experimentally measured non-monotonic variation of $\mu$ with the gate voltage $V_g$ is taken into account and yields a two-dome scenario for the superconducting critical temperature as a function of $V_g$. The observed dome in the low-$V_g$ regime is explained by the non-monotonic evolution of a dominant conventional part of the superfluid density. In contrast, the expected second dome at larger values of $V_g$ limit would be due to a dominant quantum-geometric contribution.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and electronic correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ bilayer nickelates under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the optical properties of La3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. Convincing agreement with recent experimental ambient-pressure spectra is achieved for U=3eV, which permits tracing the microscopic origin of the characteristic features. Simultaneous consistency with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction suggests the notion of rather moderate electronic correlations in this novel high-Tc superconductor. Oxygen vacancies form predominantly at the inner apical sites and renormalize the optical spectrum quantitatively, while the released electrons are largely accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition occurring under high pressure coincides with a significant enhancement of the Drude weight and a reduction of the out-of-plane interband contribution that act as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. Finally, we investigate the role of the 2-2 versus 1-3 layer stacking and compare the bilayer nickelate to La4Ni3O10, La3Ni2O6, and NdNiO2, unveiling general trends in the optical spectrum as a function of the formal Ni valence in Ruddlesden-Popper versus reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>
