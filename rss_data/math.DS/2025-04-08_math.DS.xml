      <title>A Method to Estimate a Neighborhood of a Periodic Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a method to estimate a neighborhood containing a periodic orbit of a given system of two ordinary differential equations. By using the theory of integral averages, the system of differential equations can be transformed into an equivalent autonomous system which, by using the Hopf bifurcation theorem, the existence of a periodic solution of this autonomous nonlinear differential equations can be demonstrated. Using of this procedure it is possible to estimate an annular region where the orbit of the periodic solution is located. The method allows to improve the results that the Hopf Bifurcation provides on periodic solutions. In addition, some quantitative characteristics of the solution can be known, such as the amplitude, the period and, a region where the periodic orbit of the original system is located. The method is applied to a three-dimensional system of differential equations that models the competition of two predators and one prey, which under the assumption that the predators are equally voracious, property that in this case leads to a two-dimensional system, where all of the conditions of the method described here are easily applicable.</description>

Abstract: We prove two results for $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold preserving an SRB measure $\mu$. First, if $\mu$ is exponentially mixing, then it is Bernoulli. Second, if $\mu$ is obtained as an exponential volume limit, then it is also Bernoulli.</description>

      <title>Strict H\"older equivalence of self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Lipschitz equivalence of fractals is a very active topic in recent years. It is natural to ask when two fractal sets are strictly H\"older equivalent. In the present paper, we completely characterize the strict H\"older equivalence for two classes of self-similar sets: the first class is totally-disconnected fractal cubes and the second class is self-similar sets with two branches which satisfy the strong separation condition.</description>

      <title>On the averaging theorems for stochastic perturbation of conservative linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stochastic perturbations of linear systems with non-zero pure imaginary spectrum we discuss the averaging theorems in terms of the slow-fast action-angle variables and in the sense of Krylov-Bogoliubov. Then we show that if the diffusion matrix of the perturbation is uniformly elliptic, then in all cases the averaged dynamics does not depend on a hamiltonian part of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Linear multiplicative noise destroys a two-dimensional attractive compact manifold of three-dimensional Kolmogorov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we first characterize three-dimensional Kolmogorov systems possessing a two-dimensional invariant sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, then establish a global attracting criterion for this invariant sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ except the origin, and give global dynamics with isolated equilibria on the sphere. Finally, we consider the persistence of the attractive invariant sphere under the perturbation induced by linear multiplicative Wiener noise. It is shown that suitable noise intensity can destroy the sphere and lead to bifurcation of stationary measures.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measure of dominated planar self-affine sets with large dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff measure of planar dominated self-affine sets at their affinity dimension. We show that the Hausdorff measure being positive and finite is equivalent to the K\"aenm\"aki measure being a mass distribution. Moreover, under the open bounded neighbourhood condition, we will show that the positivity of the Hausdorff measure is equivalent to the projection of the K\"aenm\"aki measure in every Furstenberg direction being absolutely continuous with bounded density. This also implies that the affinity and the Assouad dimension coincide. We will also provide examples for both of the cases when the Hausdorff measure is zero and positive.</description>

      <title>Abundance of weird quasiperiodic attractors in piecewise linear discontinuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of $n$-dimensional, $n\geq2$, piecewise linear discontinuous maps that can exhibit a new type of attractor, called a weird quasiperiodic attractor. While the dynamics associated with these attractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered class of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions, separated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic, beyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real fixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed point itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in nongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment of straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic attractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor, which may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the existence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with different types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of discontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to the appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the three-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor remain open for further investigation.</description>

      <title>A mechanism for growth of topological entropy and global changes of the shape of chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical and numerical understanding of the key concept of topological entropy is an important problem in dynamical systems. Most studies have been carried out on maps (discrete-time systems). We analyse a scenario of global changes of the structure of an attractor in continuous-time systems leading to an unbounded growth of the topological entropy of the underlying dynamical system. As an example, we consider the classical Roessler system. We show that for an explicit range of parameters a chaotic attractor exists. We also prove the existence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to the growth of the topological entropy. The proofs are computer-aided.</description>

      <title>Classification of rank-one actions via the cutting-and-stacking parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04987v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete countable infinite group. Let $T$ and $\widetilde T$ be two rank-one $\sigma$-finite measure preserving actions of $G$ and let $\mathcal T$ and $\widetilde {\mathcal T}$ be the cutting-and-stacking parameters that determine $T$ and $\widetilde T$ respectively. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on $\mathcal T$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal T}$ under which $T$ and $\widetilde T$ are isomorphic. We also show that the isomorphism equivalence relation is a $G_\delta$-subset in the Cartesian square of the set of all admissible parameters $\mathcal T$ endowed with the natural Polish topology. If $G$ is amenable and $T$ and $\widetilde T$ are finite measure preserving then we also find necessary and sufficient conditioins on $\mathcal T$ and $\widetilde {\mathcal T}$ under which $\widetilde T$ is a factor of $T$.</description>

      <title>Morse Index Theorem for Sturm-Liouville Operators on the Real Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Morse index theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the Morse index-the number of negative eigenvalues that characterize key spectral properties of linear self-adjoint differential operators-and the count of corresponding conjugate points. In this paper, we extend these foundational results to the Sturm-Liouville operator on $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, for autonomous Lagrangian systems, we employ a geometric argument to derive a lower bound for the Morse index. As concrete applications, we establish a criterion for detecting instability in traveling waves within gradient reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>On entropy of pure mixing maps on dendrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $0&lt;\alpha\le\infty$ we construct a continuous pure mixing map (topologically mixing, but not exact) on the Gehman dendrite with topological entropy $\alpha$. It has been previously shown by \v{S}pitalsk\'y that there are exact maps on the Gehman dendrite with arbitrarily low positive topological entropy. Together, these results show that the entropy of maps on the Gehman dendrite does not exhibit the paradoxical behaviour reported for graph maps, where the infimum of the topological entropy of exact maps is strictly smaller than the infimum of the entropy of pure mixing maps. The latter result, stated in terms of popular notions of chaos, says that for maps on graphs, lower entropy implies stronger Devaney chaos. The conclusion of this paper says that lower entropy does not force stronger chaos for maps of the Gehman dendrite.</description>

      <title>A general framework for quasi-isometries in symbolic dynamics beyond groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic structure which encodes a collection of countable graphs through a set of states, generators and relations. For these structures, which we call blueprints, we provide a general framework for symbolic dynamics under a partial monoid action, and for transferring invariants of their symbolic dynamics through quasi-isometries. In particular, we show that the undecidability of the domino problem, the existence of strongly aperiodic subshifts of finite type, and the existence of subshifts of finite type without computable points are all quasi-isometry invariants for finitely presented blueprints. As an application of this model, we show that a variant of the domino problem for geometric tilings of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is undecidable for $d \geq 2$ on any underlying tiling space with finite local complexity.</description>

      <title>Robust high-order low-rank BUG integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose high-order basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing a BUG step at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error and which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This error bound is finally validated experimentally on three numerical test cases. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other dynamical low-rank integrators proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>p-adic root separation and the discriminant of integer polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the following related problems: (A) the separation of $p$-adic roots of integer polynomials of a fixed degree and bounded height; and (B) counting integer polynomials of a fixed degree and bounded height with discriminant divisible by a (large) power of a fixed prime. One of the consequences of our findings is the existence, for all large $Q&gt;1$, of $Q^{2/n}$ integer irreducible polynomials $P$ of degree $n$ and height $\asymp Q$ with an almost prime power discriminant of maximal size, that is $|D(P)|\asymp Q^{2n-2}$ and $D(P)=p^kC_P$ with $C_P\in\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $|C_P|\ll1$. The method we use generalises the techniques used in the study of the real case [Beresnevich, Bernik and G\"otze, 2010 and 2016] and relies on a quantitative non-divergence estimate developed by Kleinbock and Tomanov.</description>

      <title>Distributional Control of Ensemble Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble control offers rich and diverse opportunities in mathematical systems theory. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of ensemble control, referred to as distributional control, for ensemble systems. We shift the focus from controlling the states of ensemble systems to controlling the output measures induced by their aggregated measurements. To facilitate systems-theoretic analysis of these newly formulated distributional control challenges, we establish a dynamic moment kernelization approach, through which we derive the distributional system and its corresponding moment system for an ensemble system. We further explore optimal distributional control by integrating optimal transport concepts and techniques with the moment representations, creating a systematic computational distributional control framework.</description>

      <title>Fault Localisation in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fault localisation methodology for linear time-invariant electrical networks with infinite-dimensional edge dynamics and uncertain fault dynamics. The theory accommodates instability and also bounded propagation delays in the network. The goal is to estimate the location of a fault along a given network edge, using sensors positioned arbitrarily throughout the network. Passive faults of unknown impedance are considered, along with stable faults of known impedance. To illustrate the approach, we tackle a significant use-case: a multi-conductor transmission line, with dynamics modelled by the Telegrapher's equation, subject to a line-to-ground fault. Frequency-domain insights are used to reformulate the general fault localisation problem into a non-convex scalar optimisation problem, of which the true fault location is guaranteed to be a global minimiser. Numerical experiments are run to quantify localisation performance over a range of fault resistances.</description>

      <title>On Separation of Variables for Symmetric Spaces of Rank1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study existence and nonexistence of diagonal and separating coordinates for Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 1. We generalize the results of Gauduchon and Moroianu, 2020, by showing that a symmetric space of rank 1 has diagonal coordinates if and only if it has constant sectional curvature. This implies that orthogonal separation of variables on a symmetric space of rank 1 is possible only in the constant sectional curvature case. We show that on the complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and on complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^n$, with $n\ge 2$, separating coordinates necessarily have precisely $n$ ignorable coordinates.
  In view of results of Boyer et al, 1983 and 1985, and later results of Winternitz et al, 1994, this completes the description of separation of variables on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ for all $n$ and on $\mathbb{C}H^n$ for $n=2,3$.</description>

      <title>Turing instability for nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion systems: A computer-assisted proof approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a computer-assisted proof for the Turing instability induced by heterogeneous nonlocality in reaction-diffusion systems. Due to the heterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to \textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing suitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite matrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the left half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many disks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\delta$ of the nonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive real part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of this eigenvalue as a function of $\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold $\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.</description>

      <title>Stabilising millennial oscillations in large-scale ocean circulation with a delayed feedback due to a circumpolar current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global ocean circulation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Earth's climate. The specific pattern and strength of circulation also determines how carbon and nutrients are cycled and via the resulting distribution of dissolved oxygen, where habitats suitable for marine animals occur. However, evidence from both geological data and models suggests that state transitions in circulation patterns have occurred in the past. Understanding the controls on marine environmental conditions and biodiversity requires a full appreciation of the nature and drivers of such transitions. Here we present stable millennial oscillations of meridional overturning circulation in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, cGENIE, that appear to only occur in the presence of a circumpolar current. To demonstrate that a circumpolar current can act as a driver of stable oscillations, we adapt a simple ocean box model to include a delayed feedback to represent the effect of a circumpolar current on meridional overturning circulation. We investigate the millennial oscillatory solutions that arise in the box model by bifurcation analysis and show that the model can reproduce the same bifurcation structure observed in the Earth system model. Our results provide new insights into the nature of oscillations that could have occurred under certain continental configurations in the geological past, and also highlight the potential influence of the changing Antarctic circumpolar current speed on the stability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to establish freezing phase transition of the pressure function, considering the generalized Hofbauer potential {\phi}, which is connected to the distance from subshift of finite type {\Sigma}F in the full shift {\Sigma} over finite alphabets. Our objective is to prove that the pressure function exhibits phase transition with the dominating measure is highly concentrated on {\Sigma}F after the transition. Moreover, the pressure function attains C1-smoothness when the transition occurs at 2.</description>

Abstract: We show that up to a null set, every infinite measure-preserving action of a locally compact Polish group can be turned into a continuous measure-preserving action on a locally compact Polish space where the underlying measure is Radon. We also investigate the distinction between spatial and boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup. In particular, we extend Kwiatkowska and Solecki's Point Realization Theorem to the infinite measure setup. We finally obtain a streamlined proof of a recent result of Avraham-Re'em and Roy: L\'evy groups cannot admit nontrivial continuous measure-preserving actions on Polish spaces when the measure is locally finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical scenarios with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the \emph{finite} scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically informed by the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Power Law Behavior of Center-Like Decaying Oscillation : Exponent through Perturbation Theory and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamical systems theory, there is a lack of a straightforward rule to distinguish exact center solutions from decaying center-like solutions, as both require the damping force function to be zero [1, 2]. By adopting a multi-scale perturbative method, we have demonstrated a general rule for the decaying center-like power law behavior, characterized by an exponent of 1/3 . The investigation began with a physical question about the higher-order nonlinearity in a damping force function, which exhibits birhythmic and trirhythmic behavior under a transition to a decaying center-type solution. Using numerical optimization algorithms, we identified the power law exponent for decaying center-type behavior across various rhythmic conditions. For all scenarios, we consistently observed a decaying power law with an exponent of 1/3 .Our study aims to elucidate their dynamical differences, contributing to theoretical insights and practical applications where distinguishing between different types of center-like behaviour is crucial. This key result would be beneficial for studying the multi-rhythmic nature of biological and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Societal self-regulation induces complex infection dynamics and chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically, endemic infectious diseases are expected to display relatively stable, predictable infection dynamics. Accordingly, basic disease models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model display stable endemic states or recurrent seasonal waves. However, if the human population reacts to high infection numbers by mitigating the spread of the disease, then this delayed behavioral feedback loop can generate infection waves itself, driven by periodic mitigation and subsequent relaxation. We show that such behavioral reactions, together with a seasonal effect of comparable impact, can cause complex and unpredictable infection dynamics, including Arnold tongues, coexisting attractors, and chaos. Importantly, these arise in epidemiologically relevant parameter regions where the costs associated to infections and mitigation are jointly minimized. By comparing our model to data, we find signs that COVID-19 was mitigated in a way that favored complex infection dynamics. Our results challenge the intuition that endemic disease dynamics necessarily implies predictability and seasonal waves and show the emergence of complex infection dynamics when humans optimize their reaction to increasing infection numbers.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous 2-valued dynamical systems with discrete time (dynamics) on $\mathbb{C}$. The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly invertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these dynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an example of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly invertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.</description>
