      <title>A Survey of Alternative Solutions to the Congruum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A congruum was first defined by Leonardo Pisano in 1225 and it is defined as the common difference in an arithmetic progression of three perfect squares. Later that year in his book Liber Quadratorum, Pisano proved that congruums can never perfect squares themselves, a finding that was later revisited by Pierre de Fermat in 1670. His proof is now known as Fermat's Right Triangle Theorem. In this paper, four alternative proofs to Pisano's original proof are demonstrated and offered with each proof requiring a different scope of mathematical knowledge. The proofs are by direct Diophantine analysis, parameterization of differences, Heronian triangle construction, and infinite descent. In showing these proofs, it is demonstrated that there are alternatives to the method of decomposing perfect squares as sums of odd numbers as Pisano did in his proof in 1225.</description>

      <title>A Unified Substitution Method for Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Substitution Method (USM), a systematic framework for integrating expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions, radicals, and related forms. By synthesizing classical techniques -- such as Euler substitutions, hyperbolic parameterizations, and complex exponential identities -- into a single cohesive strategy, the USM streamlines the evaluation of integrals that traditionally require fragmented, case-specific approaches. Central to the method are novel Euler-like identities that rigorously unify trigonometric, hyperbolic, and algebraic substitutions while preserving domain consistency. These transformations reduce complex integrands to rational or polynomial-like forms, bypassing ad hoc substitutions and memorization of standard formulas. Demonstrations include integrals resistant to standard Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), such as those mixing inverse trigonometric functions, and comparisons with classical Euler substitutions reveal that the latter emerge as special cases within the USM framework. Crucially, the USM extends beyond Euler substitutions by systematically handling diverse forms -- including quadratic radicals with linear shifts, inverse trigonometric integrands, and mixed-function compositions -- under a single principle. The method enhances computational efficiency, clarifies domain-specific sign choices, and serves as a robust educational and practical tool, offering a unified alternative to historically disjointed techniques in integral calculus.</description>

      <title>Exploring fixed point results in fuzzy $\mathscr{F}$-metric spaces with an application to satellite web coupling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores several fundamental aspects of fuzzy $\mathscr{F}$-metric spaces and their applications in mathematical analysis. We investigate some essential properties concerning compactness and total boundedness in fuzzy $\mathscr{F}$-metric spaces. Within this framework, we present a fixed point theorem and demonstrate its utility by applying it to the satellite web coupling problem. To support the theoretical findings, illustrative examples and a graphical representation of the contraction condition are also provided.</description>

      <title>An affirmative answer to a problem of Cater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does there exist an increasing absolutely continuous function, $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that $\{x: f'(x)=0\}$ is both countable and dense? This problem was proposed by F.S. Cater about two decades ago. We give an affirmative answer to the problem.</description>
