      <title>Forking independence in differentially closed fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a differential-algebraic description of forking independence in the stable theory DCF$_{p,m}$ of differentially closed fields of characteristic $p&gt;0$ with $m$-many commuting derivations. As a by-product of this description, we prove that types over algebraically closed subsets of the real sort are stationary. In addition, we prove that the set of non-zero solutions to the Bernoulli differential equation $x'=x^{p^k+1}$ with $k&gt;0$ is strongly minimal and its geometry is strictly disintegrated, which implies that this set is algebraically independent over $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>Forcing upper $\Sigma$-uniformization in the presence of lower $\Pi$-reduction or uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method which allows the combination of forcing uniformization on the $\Pi$- and the $\Sigma$-side of the projective hierarchy to a certain extent. Using this method we construct a universe where ${\Pi}^1_3$-reduction holds, $\Pi^1_3$-uniformization fails, yet $\Sigma^1_n$ uniformization is true for $n \ge 4$. We also construct a universe where $\Pi^1_3$-uniformization holds and for every $n \ge 4, $ $ \Sigma^1_4$-uniformization holds, lowering best known upper bound for this statement from the existence of two Woodin cardinals to $Con(\ZFC)$.</description>

      <title>Model-theoretic $K_1$ for modules over semisimple rings: (weak) Morita invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to a paper by the same authors, where they defined $K$-groups of model-theoretic structures, and computed $K_1$ of free modules over PIDs. In this paper, we compute $K_1$ of a right $M_q(R)$-module $M$, where $R$ is a division ring, $q\geq1$, and $|M_q(R)|\neq 2$. As a consequence, we obtain a (weak) Morita invariance $K_1(R_R)\cong K_1((M_q(R))_{M_q(R)})$ for all division rings $R$ and $q\geq 1$. Finally, we compute $K_1$ of a module over a semisimple ring by showing that the model-theoretic $K_1$ commutes with finite product of modules. We also show that the algebraic $K_1$ of a finite product of infinite matrix rings embeds into the model-theoretic $K_1$ of their right regular modules.</description>

      <title>Elements of Cohomology for model-theorically finite-dimensional groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the cohomology theory for groups invented by Hochshild and Serre to compute the first cohomology group for nilpotent groups that are definable in a finite-dimensional theory. Based on the established cohomological results, we derive some structural results : we prove a weak form of the Frattini argument for definable connected Cartan subgroups and we give a definable version of Maschke's theorem in the case of a definable abelian group without p-torsion. The same results hold when one works with Lie algebras instead of groups.</description>

      <title>Establishing a pre-logical setting in a quantum model of psycho-analytic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial issue both in cognitive and psychoanalytical theories deals with the origin of mental representations. In order to explore this issue, the paper analyzes a pre-logical setting, by considering a formalized approach to the foundations of psychoanalysis in logic, interpreting and integrating the views by Freud, Matte Blanco, Klein and Bion. The formalized approach derives from a quantum model of spin states. A representation of the spin state of a particle in first order logic is abstracted to get a modality interpretable as an abstract projector. The last can be decomposed into a positive, negative and irreal component. The irreal component cannot emerge and, in logic, is absorbed by the two others, giving rise to logical duality. Due to its treatment of undefiniteness and coherence, the paper is meant to contribute to quantum cognition, in its particular sense of affective quantum cognition.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of free Steiner quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free Steiner quasigroup is a free object in the variety of Steiner quasigroups. Free Steiner quasigroups are characterised by the existence of a levelled construction that starts with a free base - that is, a set of elements none of which is a product of the others, and which generate the quasigroup. Then each element in a free Steiner quasigroup $M$ can be obtained as a term on the free base. We characterise homomorphisms between substructures of a free Steiner quasigroup where one generator is replaced by a term in the original generators. The characterisation depends on certain synctactic properties of the term in question.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Contrasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomputability results in formal logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains various impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. However, a relationship between the fields' most seminal results: G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem of Formal Logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory is lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Correspondences between the two theorems are formalised by abstracting well-known diagonalisation and fixed-point arguments, and consistency and completeness properties of provability predicates in the language of Self-Reference Systems. Nevertheless, we show that the mechanisms generating Arrovian impossibility and G\"odelian incompleteness have subtle differences.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>
