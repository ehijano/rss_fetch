      <title>Quantum Stochastic Walks for Portfolio Optimization: Theory and Implementation on Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are noisy yet contain a latent graph-theoretic structure that can be exploited for superior risk-adjusted returns. We propose a quantum stochastic walk (QSW) optimizer that embeds assets in a weighted graph: nodes represent securities while edges encode the return-covariance kernel. Portfolio weights are derived from the walk's stationary distribution. Three empirical studies support the approach. (i) For the top 100 S\&amp;P 500 constituents over 2016-2024, six scenario portfolios calibrated on 1- and 2-year windows lift the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio by up to 27\% while cutting annual turnover from 480\% (mean-variance) to 2-90%. (ii) A $5^{4}=625$-point grid search identifies a robust sweet spot, $\alpha,\lambda\lesssim0.5$ and $\omega\in[0.2,0.4]$, that delivers Sharpe $\approx0.97$ at $\le 5\%$ turnover and Herfindahl-Hirschman index $\sim0.01$. (iii) Repeating the full grid on 50 random 100-stock subsets of the S\&amp;P 500 adds 31\,350 back-tests: the best-per-draw QSW beats re-optimised mean-variance on Sharpe in 54\% of cases and always wins on trading efficiency, with median turnover 36\% versus 351\%. Overall, QSW raises the annualized Sharpe ratio by 15\% and cuts turnover by 90\% relative to classical optimisation, all while respecting the UCITS 5/10/40 rule. These results show that hybrid quantum-classical dynamics can uncover non-linear dependencies overlooked by quadratic models and offer a practical, low-cost weighting engine for themed ETFs and other systematic mandates.</description>

      <title>F&amp;O Expiry vs. First-Day SIPs: A 22-Year Analysis of Timing Advantages in India's Nifty 50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) performance in India's Nifty 50 index over a 22-year period (2003--2024), focusing on the timing of investments -- specifically, the first trading day (FTD) of each month versus the monthly expiry day of Futures and Options (EXP). The research establishes, through mathematical validation, that SIP returns are independent of the invested amount. Leveraging historical index data, the study finds that SIPs timed on F\&amp;O expiry days consistently outperform FTD-SIPs by 0.5--2.5\% annually over short- to medium-term horizons (1--3 years), highlighting a tactical advantage due to expiry-related market volatility. However, this advantage diminishes over longer durations (10--20 years), reaffirming that sustained, long-term investing is the key driver of wealth accumulation. Additionally, the analysis challenges prevailing industry narratives by revealing that the 20-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of Nifty 50 SIPs stands at approximately 6.7\% (pre-tax), significantly lower than the widely advertised 12--15\% returns. This research offers novel insights for retail investors and financial planners on the role of investment timing in SIP strategies within the Indian Indian equity market.</description>

      <title>skfolio: Portfolio Optimization in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04176v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance, requiring robust computational tools that integrate statistical rigor with practical implementation. We present skfolio, an open-source Python library for portfolio construction and risk management that seamlessly integrates with the scikit-learn ecosystem. skfolio provides a unified framework for diverse allocation strategies, from classical mean-variance optimization to modern clustering-based methods, state-of-the-art financial estimators with native interfaces, and advanced cross-validation techniques tailored for financial time series. By adhering to scikit-learn's fit-predict-transform paradigm, the library enables researchers and practitioners to leverage machine learning workflows for portfolio optimization, promoting reproducibility and transparency in quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Probability Weighting and Portfolio Optimization under Semi-Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework that integrates behavioral distortions into rational portfolio optimization by extracting implied probability weighting functions (PWFs) from optimal portfolios modeled under Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) return distributions. Using DJIA constituents, we construct mean-CVaR99 frontiers, alongwith Sharpe- and CVaR-maximizing portfolios, and estimate PWFs that capture nonlinear beliefs consistent with fear and greed. We show that increasing tail fatness amplifies these distortions and that shifts in the term structure of risk-free rates alter their curvature. The results highlight the importance of jointly modeling return asymmetry and belief distortions in portfolio risk management and capital allocation under extreme-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Numeraire-invariant quadratic hedging and mean--variance portfolio allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates quadratic hedging in a semimartingale market that does not necessarily contain a risk-free asset. An equivalence result for hedging with and without numeraire change is established. This permits direct computation of the optimal strategy without choosing a reference asset and/or performing a numeraire change. New explicit expressions for optimal strategies are obtained, featuring the use of oblique projections that provide unified treatment of the case with and without a risk-free asset. The analysis yields a streamlined computation of the efficient frontier for the pure investment problem in terms of three easily interpreted processes. The main result advances our understanding of the efficient frontier formation in the most general case where a risk-free asset may not be present. Several illustrations of the numeraire-invariant approach are given.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variance measures the portfolio risks the investors are taking. The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at the current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio and assess the current return, variance, and hence the current risks of his portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of trades with the portfolio determine its return and variance in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of the portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities, which is a quadratic form in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities. Its coefficients themselves are quadratic forms in the variables of relative numbers of shares of its securities. If one assumes that the volumes of all consecutive deals with each security are constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) variance, which ignores the effects of random trade volumes. The use of the variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes could help majors like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models, like Aladdin and Azimov, to the reality of random markets.</description>
