      <title>Spin-Split Dispersion of Leaky Surface plasmons in Inversion- Symmetric System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-dependent dispersion and Rashba effect are manifestations of universal spin orbit interaction associated with the breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry in condensed matter and in optical systems. In sharp contrast to this, we report a spin-split dispersion effect of leaky surface plasmons in an inversion-symmetric one dimensional plasmonic grating system. In our system, the signature of spin-momentum locking and the resulting spin-polarization dependent splitting of dispersion of the surface plasmons are observed through the leakage radiation detected in a Fourier (momentum) domain optical arrangement. The setup enables single-shot recording of the full polarization-resolved dispersion (frequency vs transverse momentum (k)) of the leaky surface plasmons. Momentum domain polarization analysis identified a transverse momentum (k) dependent linear birefringence-linear dichroism effect (referred to as the geometric LB-LD effect) responsible for the observed spin-split dispersion. This unconventional SOI effect is reminiscent of the recently reported LB-LD effect resulting in giant chirality in centrosymmetric crystal, albeit with geometric origin. It is demonstrated that the interplay of the geometrical polarization transformation in focused polarized light and subsequent interaction of the structured field polarization with the plasmonic grating leads to the evolution of strong geometrical phase gradient or spin(circular polarization)-dependent transverse momentum of light resulting in spin-split dispersion. Our study offers a new paradigm of spin-based dispersion engineering and spin-enabled nano-optical functionalities in simple symmetric metasurfaces using geometric LB-LD effect.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Birefringence in Highly-reflective Substrate-Transferred GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Coatings at 1064 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a custom-built scanning system, we generated maps of birefringence on reflection at $\lambda=1064$~nm from single-crystal GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Bragg reflectors (henceforth ``AlGaAs coatings''). Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating was found to be $\psi = 1.09 \pm 0.18$~mrad, consistent with values observed in high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors tested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable. Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects, we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>LightPro: A Linear Photonic Processor with Full Programmability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel fully programmable linear photonic processor, which we call LightPro, with improved scalability, performance, and footprint. At the heart of LightPro are compact, low-loss, and programmable silicon photonic (SiPh) directional coupler (DC) devices that deploy phase-change material (PCM) for programming the DC's splitting ratio. By thermally inducing phase transitions in the PCM, the coupling coefficient of the DC can be dynamically adjusted to achieve different splitting ratios in the device output. Building on this device foundation, we develop a neural architecture search (NAS) and pruning algorithm to optimize the architecture of the processor for performing MVM operations. Our simulation results show that LightPro achieves up to an 85% reduction in footprint and more than 50% improvement in power consumption. In addition, LightPro is evaluated by performing inference with weight matrices trained on MNIST and linearly separable Gaussian datasets, showing less than a 5% drop in accuracy when scaling up the network. Prototyping results, using a commercial photonic processor (iPronics SmartLight), show LightPro's efficiency and performance (e.g., computational accuracy) compared to conventional photonic MVM hardware, demonstrating the experimental evaluation and feasibility of LightPro for next-generation photonic AI accelerators.</description>

      <title>High-Q microresonators unveil quantum rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical linear optics posits that at sufficiently low intensities, light propagation in dielectric media is governed solely by their linear susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate a departure from this paradigm in high-Q microresonators, where prolonged photon confinement enables rare quantum electrodynamical (QED) events, mediated by the quantum vacuum, to embed distinctive Raman signatures of the coupled analyte into the resonator's linear transmission spectrum despite their absence from the linear susceptibility. We further show that increasing the amount of adsorbed analyte amplifies these Raman fingerprints well above typical noise floors, rendering them experimentally accessible with state-of-the-art photonic architectures and detection schemes. This novel weak-coupling cavity-QED effect offers unique routes to harness extended photon lifetimes and constrained geometries for leveraging vacuum fluctuations in next-generation photonic technologies for chemical and biological sensing and high-precision optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Towards intense single-digit attosecond pulses with a 100-mJ-class mid-infrared sub-cycle laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duration of isolated attosecond pulses created via high-order harmonic generation is determined by the number of optical cycles in the driving laser. Achieving shorter attosecond soft X-ray pulses requires minimizing the number of cycles while maintaining a high pulse energy. Here, we demonstrate a carrier-envelope-phase-stable, 100-mJ-class sub-cycle mid-infrared laser that produces a supercontinuum coherent soft X-ray with unprecedented bandwidth. The system delivers 50-mJ, 6.7-fs (0.88-cycle) pulses at a center wavelength of 2.26 $\mu$m - over two orders of magnitude more energetic than any previous sub-cycle laser. We applied the system to high-order harmonic generation and compared the results to simulations based on the three-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify unique features of sub-cycle lasers. This work represents a decisive step toward high-energy half-cycle lasers and high-energy single-digit attosecond soft X-ray pulses that can be used to probe matter and light-matter interactions at previously inaccessible temporal resolutions.</description>

      <title>Temporal Scattering at Irremovable Exceptional Points in Lossless Drude Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate temporal scattering in lossless Drude media and reveal an overlooked role of the zero-frequency flat band associated with static polarization charge. This flat band forms an exceptional line spanning all wavenumbers and can be directly excited during temporal scattering at photonic time interfaces, generating non-propagating static fields alongside the usual reflected and transmitted waves. Eigenvector coalescence at the corresponding exceptional points leads to two distinctive features absent in previously studied systems: a static mode whose amplitude increases linearly with time, and an additional static component arising from the system's generalized eigenvector. Remarkably, these effects occur without violating total energy conservation, underscoring the Hermitian nature of the dynamics. Our findings present a new physical picture of temporal scattering, sharply distinct from that in dispersionless and Lorentz-dispersive media.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortices: Revolutionizing the field of linear and nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum (both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging, and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Resonance and Localization of Light in Fractal Phase Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry can fundamentally govern the propagation of light, independent of material constraints. Here, we demonstrate that a fractal phase space, endowed with a non-Euclidean, scale-dependent geometry, can intrinsically induce resonance quantization, spatial confinement, and tunable damping without the need for material boundaries or external potentials. Employing a fractional formalism with a fixed scaling exponent, we reveal how closed-loop geodesics enforce constructive interference, leading to discrete resonance modes that arise purely from geometric considerations. This mechanism enables light to localize and dissipate in a controllable fashion within free space, with geometry acting as an effective quantizing and confining agent. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, establishing geometry itself as a powerful architect of wave dynamics. Our findings open a conceptually new and experimentally accessible paradigm for material-free control in photonic systems, highlighting the profound role of geometry in shaping fundamental aspects of light propagation.</description>

      <title>Near-perfect efficiency in X-ray phase microtomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography at synchrotron sources is fundamentally limited by the high radiation dose applied to the samples, which restricts investigations to non-native tissue states and thereby compromises the biological relevance of the resulting data. The limitation stems from inefficient indirect detection schemes that require prolonged exposures. Efforts to extract additional contrast through multimodal techniques, like modulation-based imaging, worsen the problem by requiring multiple tomographic scans. In addition, the techniques suffer from low modulator pattern visibility, which reduces measurement efficiency and sensitivity. We address both the detection efficiency and modulation visibility challenges using a novel setup that combines an X-ray waveguide, a structured phase modulator, and a photon-counting detector. Our approach simultaneously achieves near-theoretical limits in both visibility (95%) and quantum efficiency (98%), thereby enabling dose-efficient multimodal microtomography at single-micrometer resolution. This advance will enable new classes of experiments on native-state biological specimens with the potential to advance biomedical research, disease diagnostics, and our understanding of tissue structure in physiological environments.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Grating Couplers with Tunable Wavelength via Scaling and Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are heavily researched devices for telecommunication, biosensing, and quantum technologies. Wafer-scale fabrication and testing are crucial for reducing costs and enabling large-scale deployment. Grating couplers allow non-invasive measurements before packaging, but classical designs rely on long tapers and narrow bandwidths. In this work, we present compact, inverse-designed grating couplers with broadband transmission. We optimized and fabricated arrays of devices and characterized them with a 4f-scanning setup. The nominal design reached simulated efficiencies of 52 %, while measurements confirmed robust performance with up to 32 % efficiency at the target 1540 nm wavelength and 46 % at shifted wavelengths. Without scaling and contour biasing, the measured efficiency at the target wavelength drops to only 4.4 %. Thus, a key finding is that systematic scaling and edge biasing recover up to an eightfold improvement in efficiency. These inverse-designed grating couplers can be efficiently corrected post-design, enabling reliable performance despite fabrication deviations. This approach allows simple layout adjustments to compensate for process-induced variations, supporting wafer-scale testing, cryogenic photonic applications, and rapid design wavelength tuning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Spin Transition at Single Particle Level in Levitating Spin Crossover Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control and understand the phase transitions of individual nanoscale building blocks is key to advancing the next generation of low-power reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. To address this critical challenge, molecular nanoparticles (NPs) exhibiting a spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon are trapped by coupling a quadrupole Paul trap with a multi-spectral polarization-resolved scattering microscope. This contact-free platform simultaneously confines, optically excites, and monitors the spin transition in Fe(II)-triazole NPs in a pressure-tunable environment, eliminating substrate artifacts. Thus, we show light-driven manipulation of the spin transition in levitating NPs free from substrate-induced effects. Using the robust spin bistability near room temperature of our SCO system, we quantify reversible opto-volumetric changes of up to 6%, revealing precise switching thresholds at the single-particle level. Independent pressure modulation produces a comparable size increase, confirming mechanical control over the same bistable transition. These results constitute full real-time control and readout of spin states in levitating SCO NPs, charting a route toward their integration into ultralow-power optical switches, data-storage elements, and nanoscale sensors.</description>

      <title>On chip plasmonic slit cavity platform for room temperature strong coupling with deterministically positioned colloidal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential for quantum information processing, high-purity single-photon sources, and nonlinear quantum devices. Achieving this regime at room temperature in a compact, deterministic on-chip platform-critical for integration with nanoelectronic circuitry and scalable device architectures-remains a major challenge, mainly due to the difficulty of fabricating cavities with ultra-small mode volumes and precisely positioning quantum emitters. Here, we demonstrate a robust quantum plasmonic device in which colloidal quantum dots (Qdots) are strongly coupled to plasmonic slit cavities using a dielectrophoresis-based positioning technique with real-time photoluminescence (PL) feedback, providing directly resolvable coupled structures that enable parallel device fabrication and straightforward integration with additional optical elements such as waveguides. Our measurements reveal clear PL resolved Rabi splitting at room temperature with pre characterized cavities, with variations across devices that scale with the average number of coupled Qdots. While electrical tuning via the quantum-confined Stark effect is enabled by integrated electrodes, its impact is largely overshadowed by room-temperature spectral diffusion. Our results pave the way for scalable, electrically tunable quantum plasmonic platforms, offering new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic circuits, active light-matter interactions, and room-temperature quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Self-Oscillatory Light Emission in Plasmonic Molecular Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-oscillators are intriguing due to their ability to sustain periodic motion without periodic stimulus. They remain rare as achieving such behavior requires a balance of energy input, dissipation and non-linear feedback mechanism. Here, we report a molecular-scale optoelectronic self-oscillatory system based on electrically excited plasmons. This system generates light via inelastic electron tunnelling, where electrons lose their energy to molecules and excite the surface plasmon polaritons that decay radiatively. Time-series imaging of photon emission in gold-naphthalene-2-thiol-EGaIn junctions, together with correlation mapping of individual emission spots, reveal long-lived (~1000 s), low-frequency oscillations (1-20 mHz) interspersed with transient high-frequency (20-200 mHz) bursts. This behavior can be explained by attributing individual emission spots to single-molecule resistors that follow Kirchhoff's circuit laws. Induced by tunnelling current, these individual spots emit in a correlated way, self-sustaining the overall oscillatory emission from the whole junction. Our observation is of great interest as it resonates with a broader understanding of similar molecular-scale dynamic systems such as picocavities, offering exciting potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Intensity-Correlation Synthetic Wavelength Imaging in Dynamic Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging through dynamic scattering media, such as biological tissue, presents a fundamental challenge due to light scattering and the formation of speckle patterns. These patterns not only degrade image quality but also decorrelate rapidly, limiting the effectiveness of conventional approaches, such as those based on transmission matrix measurements. Here, we introduce an imaging approach based on second-order correlations and synthetic wavelength holography (SWH) to enable robust image reconstruction through thick and dynamic scattering media. By exploiting intensity speckle correlations and using short-exposure intensity images, our method computationally reconstructs images from a hologram without requiring phase stability or static speckles, making it inherently resilient to phase noise. Experimental results demonstrate high-resolution imaging in both static and dynamic scattering scenarios, offering a promising solution for biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and real-time imaging in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Towards a mobile quantitative phase imaging microscope with smartphone phase-detection sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables visualization and quantitative extraction of the optical phase information of transparent samples. However, conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\times2$ pixel group. The phase gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens, which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports an innovative concept of ``plasma fibre" using bright-core helicon plasma, inspired by its spatial and spectral similarities to the well-known optical fibre. Theoretical analyses are presented for both ideal case of step-like density profile and the realistic case of Gaussian density profile in radius. The total reflection of electromagnetic waves near the sharp plasma density gradient and consequently the wave-guide feature could indeed happen if the incident angle is larger than a threshold value. Numerical computations using electromagnetic solver that based on Maxwell's equations and cold-plasma dielectric tensor yield consistent results. The experimental verification and prospective applications are also suggested. The ``plasma fibre" could be functional component that embedded into existing communication systems for special purpose based on its capability of dynamic reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered, as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable crystal orientation when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>Optical Micromanipulations based on Model Predictive Control of Thermoviscous Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision micromanipulation techniques, including optical tweezers and hydrodynamic trapping, have garnered wide-spread interest. Recent advances in optofluidic multiplexed assembly and microrobotics demonstrate significant progress, particularly by iteratively applying laser-induced, localized flow fields to manipulate microparticles in viscous solutions. However, these approaches still face challenges such as undesired hydrodynamic coupling and instabilities when multiple particles are brought into close proximity. By leveraging an analytical model of thermoviscous flows, this work introduces a stochastic optimization approach that selects flow fields for precise particle arrangement without relying on rule-based heuristics. Through minimizing a comprehensive objective function, the method achieves sub-micrometer alignment accuracy even in a crowded setting, avoiding instabilities driven by undesired coupling or particle collisions. An autonomously emerging "action at a distance" strategy - placing the laser scan path farther from the manipulated particles over time - exploits the $1/r^2$ decay of thermoviscous flow to refine positioning. Overall, objective function-based model predictive control enhances the versatility of automated optofluidic manipulations, opening new avenues in assembly, micromanufacturing, robotics, and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Directional quantum scattering transducer in cooperative Rydberg metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-photon transduction scheme using 4-wave-mixing and quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays that is both efficient and highly directional and may allow for terahertz-to-optical transduction. In the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition. As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific, highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane. Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for finite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes that narrow as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Our scheme combines the broadband acceptance of free-space 4-wave mixing with the efficiency, directionality and tunability of cooperative metasurfaces, offering a route towards quantum-coherent THz detection and processing for astronomical spectroscopy, quantum-networked sparse-aperture imaging and other quantum-sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Imaging Significantly Improves Deep-Learning based Detection of Synthetic Early-Stage Lung Tumors in Preclinical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI, or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51 percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is unavailable.</description>

Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical investigation of solid-core photonic crystal fibers with circular and hexagonal cladding geometries. The goal is to optimize optical parameters for nonlinear photonics and environmental sensing. Full-vectorial simulations using FDTD, PWE, and FDE are used to analyze the effects of core diameter, pitch, and air filling fraction on the zero-dispersion wavelength, nonlinear coefficient, effective mode area, and confinement loss. Reducing the core diameter from 2.4 to 1.4 microns tunes the zero-dispersion wavelength from 791 to 646 nanometers and increases the nonlinear coefficient by 72 percent, from 72 to 124 inverse watts per kilometer. The study also examines the effect of isopropyl alcohol infiltration, which causes a red-shift in dispersion and degrades confinement. These results offer a design framework that balances nonlinear efficiency and environmental robustness for supercontinuum generation and chemical sensing.</description>

Abstract: Femtosecond laser, owing to their ultrafast time scales and broad frequency bandwidths, have substantially changed fundamental science over the past decades, from chemistry and bio-imaging to quantum physics. Critically, many emerging industrial-scale photonic technologies -- such as optical interconnects, AI accelerators, quantum computing, and LiDAR -- also stand to benefit from their massive frequency parallelism. However, achieving a femtosecond-scale laser on-chip, constrained by size and system power input, has remained a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip femtosecond laser, enabled by a new mechanism -- photorefraction-assisted soliton (PAS) mode-locking. Operating from a simple, low-voltage electrical supply, the laser provides deterministic, turn-key generation of sub-90-fs solitons. Furthermore, it provides electronic reconfigurability of its pulse properties and features an exceptional optical coherence with a 53 Hz intrinsic comb linewidth. This demonstration removes a key barrier to the full integration of chip-scale photonic systems for next-generation sensing, communication, metrology, and computing.</description>

      <title>Generation of Coherent Quantum Light from a Single Impurity-Bound Exciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</description>
