      <title>Predicting protein folding dynamics using sequence information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural protein sequences somehow encode the structural forms that these molecules adopt. Recent developments in structure-prediction are agnostic to the mechanisms by which proteins fold and represent them as static objects. However, the amino acid sequences also encode information about how the folding process can happen, and how variations in the sequences impact on the populations of the distinct structural forms that proteins acquire. Here we present a method to infer protein folding dynamics based only on sequence information. For this, we will rely first on the obtention of a precise 'evolutionary field' from the observed variations in the sequences of homologous proteins. We then show how to map the energetics to a coarse-grained folding model where the protein is treated as a string of foldons that interact. We then describe how, for any given protein sequence of a family, the equilibrium folding curve can be computed and how the emergence of protein folding sub-domains can be identified. We finally present protocols to analyze how mutations perturb both the folding stability and the cooperativity, that represent predictions for a deep-mutational scan of a protein of interest.</description>

      <title>Flexible MOF Generation with Torsion-Aware Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a long-standing challenge due to their large combinatorial space and the complex 3D arrangements of building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known ground-truth local block-wise 3D coordinates. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage de novo MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train a SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate novel metal and organic building blocks, paired with cheminformatics for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow-matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble flexible blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability of our model to create novel building blocks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.</description>

      <title>OneProt: Towards Multi-Modal Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</description>
