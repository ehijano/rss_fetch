      <title>Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities $\gtrsim 900$ km/s, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star, or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the $\texttt{Athena++}$ code modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf, and the supernova ejecta. We find that $\approx 0.01-0.02\,M_{\odot}$ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the post-explosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the $\texttt{MESA}$ code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for $\approx 10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs. We show that the post-explosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the $\delta$ Scuti eclipsing binary KIC 4851217 and its tertiary companion as well as detection of tidally tilted pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar theory enables us to understand the properties of stars at different stages of their evolution, and contributes to other fields of astrophysics such as galactic and exoplanet studies. Assessing the accuracy of stellar theories necessitates high precision, model-independent measurements of the properties of real stars, such as those obtainable for the components of double lined eclipsing binaries (DLEBs), while asteroseismology offers probing power of the stellar interior if one or both components pulsate. KIC 4851217 is a DLEB containing two late A-type stars and exhibits pulsations of the $\delta$ Scuti type. By analysing high resolution HERMES and moderate resolution ISIS spectra, jointly with Kepler and TESS light curves, we measured the masses, radii and effective temperatures of the components to precisions of ~0.5, ~1.1 and ~1 per cent, respectively. We additionally report the discovery and characterisation of a tertiary M-dwarf companion. Models of the system's spectral energy distribution agree with an age of 0.82 Gyr, with the more massive and larger secondary component near the end of the main sequence lifetime. An examination of the pulsating component's pulsation frequencies reveals 39 pulsation multiplets that are split by the orbital frequency. For most of these, it is evident that the pulsation axes have been tilted into the orbital plane. This makes KIC 4851217 a tidally tilted pulsator (TTP). This precisely characterized $\delta$ Scuti DLEB is an ideal candidate for advancing intermediate-mass stellar theory, contributing to our understanding of hierarchichal systems as well as to the topic of TTPs.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of subgroups of stars associated with open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified star clusters with multiple components based on accurate spatial distributions and/or proper motions from Gaia DR3, utilising diverse diagnostics to improve our understanding of subgroup evolution. These findings motivated us to search for subgroups among the objects examined in our previous work, which employed fractal statistics. The present study considers seven open clusters that exhibit significant dispersion in age and/or proper motion distributions, suggesting that they would not be single clusters. For characterizing the stellar groups, we calculate the membership probability using Bayesian multi-dimensional analysis by fitting the observed proper motion distribution of the candidates. A probability distribution is also used to determine the distance of the cluster, which is obtained from the mean value of the distance modes. The photometry from Gaia DR3 is compared with evolutionary models to estimate the cluster age and total mass. In our sample, double components are found only for Markarian 38 and NGC 2659. The other five clusters are confirmed as being single. The structural parameters, such as Q, Lambda_MSR and Sigma_LDR are compared with results from N-body simulations to investigate how the morphology of the stellar clustering evolves. The new results, for a more complete sample of cluster members, provide a better definition of the distribution type (central concentration or substructured region) inferred from the m-s plot.</description>

      <title>Flare Accelerated Electrons in Kappa-Distribution from X-Ray Spectra with Warm-Target Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations provide essential and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of non-thermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons of a few thermal speeds are more complex. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (warm-target model) has recently been developed for Hard X-ray spectral analysis. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cut-off, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has shown successful application in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and STIX, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower non-thermal energy when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range compared to the power-law form. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small fit uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy in the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>High-latitude coronal mass ejections on the young solar-like star AB Dor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AB Dor is a young solar-type star with a surface large-scale magnetic field $10^2$ to $10^3$ times stronger than the that of the Sun. Although strong magnetic fields are thought to inhibit coronal mass ejections (CMEs), dimming signatures typically associated with an eruptive CME were recently observed in AB Dor. The uninterrupted, long-duration dimming signal suggests that a CME took place at a high latitude, where it remained in view as the star rotates. A high-latitude CME is also consistent with observations that indicate that AB Dor hosts polar active regions. To investigate magnetic confinement in AB Dor, we conduct a parametric modelling study of twenty-one CMEs at latitudes $\sim 60^\circ$, varying the location, mass and magnetic field strength of an injected flux rope. Twelve models had the flux rope located in an open magnetic field region, while the remaining nine were in a closed region. Results show that CMEs in open-field regions are in general more likely to erupt. The four eruptive CMEs from closed regions had high free magnetic energies $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{35}$ erg, and ten CMEs, predominantly from the closed-field regions (8/10) were confined. CMEs in closed-field regions exhibited lower kinetic energies, since part of the CME energy was expended to overcome magnetic tension and break open the overlying field. In conclusion our work suggests that eruptive CMEs in AB Dor may occur in high-latitude regions of open magnetic field, as the magnetic tension in such regions does not significantly inhibit the eruption.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundance gradients of organic molecules within a protostellar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially-unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN, we aim to determine if CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly-luminous intermediate mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN yields rotational temperatures of $198 \pm 1.2$ K and $448 \pm 19$ K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of $4\times10^{-8}$ reproduces the CH$_3$OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH$_3$CN needs to be either more compact (within $\sim120$ au versus $\sim240$ au for CH$_3$OH) or exhibiting a factor of $\gtrsim 15$ increase in abundance in the inner $\sim55$ au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN is carbon-grain sublimation.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Cataclysmic Variables in the Chandra Source Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are compact binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a Roche-lobe-filling companion star. In this study, we searched for new CVs in the Milky Way in the Chandra Source Catalog v2.0, cross-matched with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We identified new CV candidates by combining X-ray and optical data in a color-color diagram called the ``X-ray Main Sequence". We used two different cuts in this diagram to compile pure and optically variable samples of CV candidates. We undertook optical spectroscopic follow-up observations with the Keck and Palomar Observatories to confirm the nature of these sources. We assembled a sample of 25,887 Galactic X-ray sources and found 14 new CV candidates. Seven objects show X-ray and/or optical variability. All sources show X-ray luminosity in the $\rm 10^{29}-10^{32}$ $\rm erg\ s^{-1}$ range, and their X-ray spectra can be approximated by a power-law model with photon indices in the $\rm \Gamma \sim 1-3$ range or an optically thin thermal emission model in the $\rm kT \sim 1-70$ keV range. We spectroscopically confirmed four CVs, discovering two new polars, one low accretion rate polar and a WZ~Sge-like low accretion rate CV. X-ray and optical properties of the other 9 objects suggest that they are also CVs (likely magnetic or dwarf novae), and one other object could be an eclipsing binary, but revealing their true nature requires further observations. These results show that a joint X-ray and optical analysis can be a powerful tool for finding new CVs in large X-ray and optical catalogs. X-ray observations such as those by Chandra are particularly efficient at discovering magnetic and low accretion rate CVs, which could be missed by purely optical surveys.</description>

      <title>Effects of Variable Mass, Disk-Like Structure, and Radiation Pressure on the Dynamics of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we intend to investigate the dynamics of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Here we assumed the primaries as the source of radiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like structure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium points in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like structure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear equilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also breaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the quasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points are stable if the mass ratio $\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\mu_c$. It shows that the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.</description>

      <title>Neglected Silicon Dioxide Polymorphs as Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct mid-infrared signatures of silicate clouds in substellar atmospheres were first detected in Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs, although their existence was previously inferred from near-infrared spectra. With the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instrument on JWST, we can now more deeply probe silicate features from 8 to 10 microns, exploring specific particle composition, size, and structure. Recent characterization efforts have led to the identification in particular of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO$_2$) cloud features in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Previous modeling, motivated by chemical equilibrium considerations, has primarily focused on magnesium silicates (forsterite, enstatite), crystalline quartz, and amorphous silica to match observations. Here, we explore the previously neglected possibility that other crystalline structures of silica, i.e. polymorphs, may be more likely to form at the pressure and temperature conditions of substellar upper atmospheres. We show how these polymorphs may be distinguished from each other with current JWST observations. We also explore how such particles could form and be dynamically lofted and sedimented throughout the atmosphere, and implications for the underlying chemical and dynamical processes governing these objects. We ultimately propose that accounting for the distinct opacities arising from the possible crystalline structure of cloud materials may act as a powerful, observable diagnostic tracer of atmospheric conditions, where particle crystallinity records the history of the atmospheric regions through which clouds formed and evolved. Finally, we highlight that high fidelity, accurate laboratory measurements of silica polymorphs are critically needed to draw meaningful conclusions about the identities and structures of clouds in substellar atmospheres.</description>

      <title>SOLES XI. The Aligned Orbit of TOI-2533 b, a Transiting Brown Dwarf Orbiting an F8-type Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs occupy a middle ground in mass space between gaseous giant planets and ultra-cool dwarf stars, and the characterisation of their orbital orientations may shed light on how these neighbouring objects form. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of TOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\pm0.0090$) and wide-separation ($a_b/R_\star = 13.34\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type star, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival photometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown dwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf system with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -7\pm14^{\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the brown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also indicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\pm5.3$ M$_{\rm \tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we find that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in a primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planet GJ 367 b is a recently discovered high-density sub-Earth orbiting an M dwarf star. Its composition was modelled to be predominantly iron with a potential remainder of a hydrogen-helium envelope. Here we report an X-ray detection of this planet's host star for the first time, using data from the spectro-imaging X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission. We characterise the magnetic activity of the host star from the X-ray data and estimate its effects on a potential atmosphere of the planet. We find that despite the very low activity level of the host star the expected mass loss rates, both under core-powered and photoevaporative mass loss regimes, are so high that a potential primordial or outgassed atmosphere would evaporate very quickly. Since the activity level of the host star indicates that the system is several Gigayears old, it is very unlikely that the planet currently still hosts any atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Fully-formed Forward--Reverse Shock Pair Due to the Interaction Between Two Coronal Mass Ejections at 0.5 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report direct observations of a fast magnetosonic forward--reverse shock pair observed by Solar Orbiter on March 8, 2022 at the short heliocentric distance of 0.5 au. The structure, sharing some features with fully-formed stream interaction regions (SIRs), is due to the interaction between two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), never previously observed to give rise to a forward--reverse shock pair. The scenario is supported by remote observations from the STEREO-A coronographs, where two candidate eruptions compatible with the in-situ signatures have been found. In the interaction region, we find enhanced energetic particle activity, strong non-radial flow deflections and evidence of magnetic reconnection. At 1~au, well radially-aligned \textit{Wind} observations reveal a complex event, with characteristic observational signatures of both SIR and CME--CME interaction, thus demonstrating the importance of investigating the complex dynamics governing solar eruptive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field diagnostics of prominences with the Mg II k line: 3D Stokes inversions versus traditional methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mg II k resonance line is commonly used for diagnosing the solar chromosphere. We theoretically investigated its intensity and polarization in solar prominences, taking 3D radiative transfer and Hanle and Zeeman effects into account. We used an optically thick 3D model representative of a solar prominence and applied several inversion methods to the synthetic Stokes profiles, clarifying their pros and cons for inferring prominence magnetic fields. We conclude that the self-consistent 3D inversion with radiative transfer is necessary to determine the magnetic field vector, although its geometry cannot be inferred with full fidelity. We also demonstrate that more traditional methods, such as those based on the weak field approximation or the constant-property slab assumption, can offer useful information under certain conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.9^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=5.36^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ AU, $e_{c}=0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) exterior to previously known close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocity observations. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected obliquity $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true obliquity of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is the first hot Jupiter system where both the true obliquity of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>
