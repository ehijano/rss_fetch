      <title>Polar: An Algebraic Analyzer for (Probabilistic) Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Polar framework for fully automating the analysis of classical and probabilistic loops using algebraic reasoning. The central theme in Polar comes with handling algebraic recurrences that precisely capture the loop semantics. To this end, our work implements a variety of techniques to compute exact closed-forms of recurrences over higher-order moments of variables, infer invariants, and derive loop sensitivities with respect to unknown parameters. Polar can analyze probabilistic loops containing if-statements, polynomial arithmetic, and common probability distributions. By translating loop analysis into linear recurrence solving, Polar uses the derived closed-forms of recurrences to compute the strongest polynomial invariant or to infer parameter sensitivity. Polar is both sound and complete within well-defined programming model restrictions. Lifting any of these restrictions results in significant hardness limits of computation. To overcome computational burdens for the sake of efficiency, Polar also provides incomplete but sound techniques to compute moments of combinations of variables.</description>

      <title>Optimal Program Synthesis via Abstract Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing programs with numerical constants that optimize a quantitative objective, such as accuracy, over a set of input-output examples. We propose a general framework for optimal synthesis of such programs in a given domain specific language (DSL), with provable optimality guarantees. Our framework enumerates programs in a general search graph, where nodes represent subsets of concrete programs. To improve scalability, it uses A* search in conjunction with a search heuristic based on abstract interpretation; intuitively, this heuristic establishes upper bounds on the value of subtrees in the search graph, enabling the synthesizer to identify and prune subtrees that are provably suboptimal. In addition, we propose a natural strategy for constructing abstract transformers for monotonic semantics, which is a common property for components in DSLs for data classification. Finally, we implement our approach in the context of two such existing DSLs, demonstrating that our algorithm is more scalable than existing optimal synthesizers.</description>

      <title>Debugging code world models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</description>
