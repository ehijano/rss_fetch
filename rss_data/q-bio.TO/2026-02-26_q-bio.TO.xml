      <title>Towards Structure-Aware Surrogate Modeling: Explicit Region Interaction Improves Knee Contact Stress Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee contact-stress hotspots are closely linked to meniscal/cartilage injury risk. Still, high-fidelity subject-specific FEA is too computationally expensive for large-cohort, multi-condition, near-real-time use. Existing MeshGraphNet-style surrogates mainly rely on stacked local message passing, which is often insufficient for modeling long-range dependencies and limits interpretability. This study benchmarked a deep-stacked baseline model against three explicit region-interaction architectures. Using a 90{\deg} change-of-direction task and a strict cross-subject evaluation framework, we assessed whole-field error, peak stress fidelity, and hotspot spatial consistency under matched computational budgets. Region-interaction models significantly reduced whole-field nodal stress errors compared to the purely stacked baseline. Crucially, they achieved markedly higher accuracy in reconstructing the high-stress tail and demonstrated superior spatial consistency and temporal robustness in localizing high-risk stress hotspots. Explicit region-level interaction provides a more structure-aligned surrogate modeling paradigm for knee contact mechanics and yields stronger risk-relevant stress phenotype recovery under comparable computational budgets, while supporting more interpretable injury-risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Universal Persistent Brownian Motions in Confluent Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues are active materials whose non-equilibrium dynamics emerge from distinct cellular force-generating mechanisms. Using a two-dimensional active foam model, we compare the effects of traction forces and junctional tension fluctuations on confluent tissue dynamics. While these two modes of activity produce qualitatively different cell shapes, rearrangement statistics, and spatiotemporal correlations in fluid states, we find that the long-time cellular motion universally converges to persistent Brownian dynamics. This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.</description>

      <title>From the Hallmarks of Cancer to the Survival System: A Paradigmatic Reconstruction of Oncological Theory through the Existential Crisis-Driven Survival (ECDS) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malignant tumors exhibit complex pathogenesis, yet classical oncological theories remain fragmented, failing to provide a unifying framework to address this complexity. This gap limits the utility and translational potential of the prevailing "confront-and-eradicate" therapeutic paradigm, constraining transformative therapeutic breakthroughs and driving the emergence of acquired and recurrent drug resistance. Here, we propose the Tumor Existential Crisis-Driven Survival (ECDS) theory, anchored in the core proposition that impairment of Existential Stability drives the compensatory hyperactivation of Survival Capacity. This framework defines three foundational constructs (Existential Stability, Survival Capacity, and Existence Threshold) and three guiding principles, unifying and integrating canonical core theories of tumorigenesis. It delineates the dynamic coupling between declining Existential Stability and escalating Survival Capacity during tumor evolution, reinterprets the hierarchical activation of the well-established 14 cancer hallmarks, elucidates the redundancy of survival signaling pathways that underpins intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity, and unravels the "hierarchical leap" in therapeutic resistance. By reframing tumors as "Existential Stability erosion-driven passive survival systems" rather than "intrinsically aggressive cellular aggregates", ECDS challenges prevailing dogma, uncovers tumors' intrinsic vulnerability, and establishes a robust meta-theoretical foundation for both basic cancer research and translational clinical management.</description>
