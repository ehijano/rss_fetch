      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Models in Enzyme Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzyme kinetics has historically been described by deterministic models, with the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation serving as a paradigm. However, recent experimental and theoretical advances have made it clear that stochastic fluctuations, particularly at low copy numbers or single-enzyme levels, can profoundly impact reaction outcomes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of enzyme kinetics from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We begin by deriving the classical Michaelis-Menten equation under the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) and discuss its validity. We then formulate the corresponding stochastic model via the chemical master equation (CME) and illustrate how the Gillespie algorithm can simulate single-molecule events and briefly use Kampen's system-size expansion to justify our simulation methods. Through extended computational analyses -- including variance calculations, phase-plane exploration, and parameter sensitivity -- we highlight how deterministic and stochastic predictions coincide in certain limits but can diverge in small systems. We further incorporate case studies from single-enzyme turnover experiments and cellular contexts to showcase the real-world implications of noise. Taken together, our results underscore the necessity of a multifaceted modeling strategy, whereby one can switch between deterministic methods and stochastic realism to gain a fuller understanding of enzyme kinetics at different scales.</description>

      <title>UQSA -- An R-Package for Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis for Biochemical Reaction Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction models describing subcellular processes generally come with a large uncertainty. To be able to account for this during the modeling process, we have developed the R-package UQSA, performing uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in an integrated fashion. UQSA is designed for fast sampling of complicated multi-dimensional parameter distributions, using efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques and Vine-copulas to model complicated joint distributions. We perform MCMC sampling both from stochastic and deterministic models, in either likelihood-free or likelihood-based settings. In the likelihood-free case, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), while for likelihood-based sampling we provide different algorithms, including the fast geometry-informed algorithm SMMALA (Simplified Manifold Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm). The uncertainty quantification can be followed by a variance decomposition-based global sensitivity analysis. We are aiming for biochemical models, but UQSA can be used for any type of reaction networks. The use of Vine-copulas allows us to describe, evaluate, and sample from complicated parameter distributions, as well as adding new datasets in a sequential manner without redoing the previous parameter fit. The code is written in R, with C as a backend to improve speed. We use the SBtab table format for Systems Biology projects for the model description as well as the experimental data. An event system allows the user to model complicated transient input, common within, e.g., neuroscience. UQSA has an extensive documentation with several examples describing different types of models and data. The code has been tested on up to 2000 cores on several nodes on a computing cluster, but we also include smaller examples that can be run on a laptop.
