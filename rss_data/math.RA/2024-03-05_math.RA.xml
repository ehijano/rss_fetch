      <title>$\pi$-systems and the Embedding problem for rank $2$ Kac-Moody Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\pi$-systems are fundamental in the study of Kac-Moody Lie algebras since they arise naturally in the embedding problems. Dynkin introduced them first and showed how they also appear in the classification of semisimple subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra. In this article, we explicitly classify the $\pi$-systems associated to rank $2$ Kac-Moody Lie algebras and prove that in most of the cases they are linearly independent. This classification allows us to determine the root generated subalgebras and which in turn determines all possible Kac-Moody algebras that can be embedded in a rank $2$ Kac-Moody algebra as subalgebras generated by real root vectors. Additionally, following the work of Naito we provide examples illustrating how Borcherds Kac-Moody algebras can also be embedded inside a rank $2$ Kac-Moody algebra.</description>

      <title>Bergman algebras: The graded universal algebra constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A half a century ago, George Bergman introduced stunning machinery which would realise any commutative conical monoid as the non-stable $K$-theory of a ring. The ring constructed is ``minimal" or ``universal". Given the success of graded $K$-theory in classification of algebras and its connections to dynamics and operator algebras, the realisation of $\Gamma$-monoids (monoids with an action of an abelian group $\Gamma$ on them) as non-stable graded $K$-theory of graded rings becomes vital. In this paper, we revisit Bergman's work and develop the graded version of this universal construction. For an abelian group $\Gamma$, a $\Gamma$-graded ring $R$, and non-zero graded finitely generated projective (left) $R$-modules $P$ and $Q$, we construct a universal $\Gamma$-graded ring extension $S$ such that $S\otimes_R P\cong S\otimes_R Q$ as graded $S$-modules. This makes it possible to bring the graded techniques, such as smash products and Zhang twists into Bergman's machinery. Given a commutative conical $\Gamma$-monoid $M$, we construct a $\Gamma$-graded ring $S$ such that $\mathcal V^{gr}(S)$ is $\Gamma$-isomorphic to $M$. In fact we show that any finitely generated $\Gamma$-monoid can be realised as the non-stable graded $K$-theory of a hyper Leavitt path algebra. Here $\mathcal V^{gr}(S)$ is the monoid of isomorphism classes of graded finitely generated projective $S$-modules and the action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathcal V^{gr}(S)$ is by shift of degrees. Thus the group completion of $M$ can be realised as the graded Grothendieck group $K^{\gr}_0(S)$. We use this machinery to provide a short proof to the fullness of the graded Grothendieck functor $K^{gr}_0$ for the class of Leavitt path algebras (i.e., Graded Classification Conjecture II).</description>

Abstract: We extend a recently established combinatorial index formula applying to Lie poset algebras of types B, C, and D. Then, using the extended index formula, we determine a characterization of contact Lie poset algebras of types B, C, and D corresponding to posets of height one in terms of an associated graph.</description>

      <title>The unitary Cayley graph of upper triangular matrix rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary Cayley graph $C_R$ of a finite unital ring $R$ is the simple graph with vertex set $R$ in which two elements $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge if and only if $x-y$ is a unit of $R$. We characterize the unitary Cayley graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ of the ring of all upper triangular matrices $T_n(\mathbb{F})$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. We show that $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ is isomorphic to the semistrong product of the complete graph $K_m$ and the antipodal graph of the Hamming graph $A(H(n,p^k))$, where $m=p^{\frac{kn(n-1)}{2}}$ and $|\mathbb{F}|=p^k$. In particular, if $|\mathbb{F}|=2$, then the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ has $2^{n-1}$ connected components, each component is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,m}$, where $m=2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. We also compute the diameter, triameter, and clique number of the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$.</description>

      <title>Ultimate codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear block code over a field can be derived from a unit scheme. Looking at codes as a structure within a unit scheme greatly extends the available of codes, both linear block and convolutional, and allows the construction of particular types of codes and to required length, rate, distance and over specified fields as required. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. Orthogonal units and related orthogonal type units, units in group rings and Fourier/Vandermonde are types of units which are used to construct and analyse particular types of codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate and distance. Dual containing codes, which include self-dual codes, and complementary dual codes as well as codes to specified rate and over specified finite fields are constructible. Low density parity check linear and convolutional codes to required rates are constructed using group rings. From a single unit, multiple codes of a required type are derivable. Using the full unit, rather than just part of the unit, allows the construction of convolutional codes to required types, rates and structure. The distances of the convolutional codes are determinable from the constituents of the unit used and are much better than the distance of an equivalent rate linear code but also efficient convolutional decoding methods are applicable. Dual-containing and complementary dual convolutional codes are constructed by the unit-derived methods from suitable units. Dual-containing convolutional codes are used to construct quantum error-correcting convolutional codes. `Manufacturing' of different and sophisticated `models' is now possible.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on the tensor product of semi-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt a new perspective on the tensor product of arbitrary semi-lattices. Our basic construction exploits a description of semi-lattices in terms of bi-extensional Chu spaces associated to a target space defined to be the boolean domain.  The comparison between our tensor product and the canonical tensor product, introduced by G.A. Fraser, is made in the distributive case and in the general case.  Some properties of our tensor products are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the quotient of a Leavitt path algebra of an arbitrary graph by an $I$-basic graded ideal, and the quotient of a Leavitt path algebra of a row-finite graph by an arbitrary graded ideal are considered. The result of the quotient of a Leavitt path algebra by an arbitrary graded ideal is extended by using the function $\varphi$. Examples are given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance of (logarithmic) intertwining operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Waring Problem for Matrices over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for all integers $k \geq 1$, $q\ge (k-1)^4+ 6k$, and $m \geq 1$, every matrix in $ M_m(\mathbb F_q)$ is a sum of two kth powers: $M_m(\mathbb F_q)=\{A^k+B^k|A,B\in M_m(\mathbb F_q)\}$. We further generalize and refine this result in the cases when both $B$ and $C$ can be chosen to be invertible, cyclic, or split semisimple, when $k$ is coprime to $p$, or when $m$ is sufficiently large. We also give a criterion for the Waring problem in terms of stabilizers.</description>

      <title>Super Caldero--Chapoton map for type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One can explicitly compute the generators of a surface cluster algebra either combinatorially, through dimer covers of snake graphs, or homologically, through the CC-map applied to indecomposable modules over the appropriate algebra. Recent work by Musiker, Ovenhouse and Zhang used Penner and Zeitlin's decorated super Teichm{\"u}ller theory to define a super version of the cluster algebra of type $A$ and gave a combinatorial formula to compute the even generators. We extend this theory by giving a homological way of explicitly computing these generators by defining a super CC-map for type $A$.</description>
