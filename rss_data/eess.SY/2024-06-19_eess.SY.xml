      <title>QoE Maximization for Multiple-UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Edge Computing: An Online Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disaster scenarios, conventional terrestrial multi-access edge computing (MEC) paradigms, which rely on fixed infrastructure, may become unavailable due to infrastructure damage. With high-probability line-of-sight (LoS) communication, flexible mobility, and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC is emerging as a new promising paradigm to provide edge computing services for ground user devices (UDs) in disaster-stricken areas. However, the limited battery capacity, computing resources, and spectrum resources also pose serious challenges for UAV-assisted MEC, which can potentially shorten the service time of UAVs and degrade the quality of experience (QoE) of UDs without an effective control approach. To this end, in this work, we first present a hierarchical architecture of multiple-UAV-assisted MEC networks that enables the coordinated provision of edge computing services by multiple UAVs. Then, we formulate a joint task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory planning optimization problem (JTRTOP) to maximize the QoE of UDs while considering the energy consumption constraints of UAVs. Since the problem is proven to be a future-dependent and NP-hard problem, we propose a novel online joint task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory planning approach (OJTRTA) to solve the problem. Specifically, the JTRTOP is first transformed into a per-slot real-time optimization problem (PROP) using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, a two-stage optimization method based on game theory and convex optimization is proposed to solve the PROP. Simulation results provide empirical evidence supporting the superior system performance of the proposed OJTRTA in comparison to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Hacking Encrypted Wireless Power: Cyber-Security of Dynamic Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, energy encryption for wireless power transfer has been developed for energy safety, which is important in public places to suppress unauthorized energy extraction. Most techniques vary the frequency so that unauthorized receivers cannot extract energy because of non-resonance. However, this strategy is unreliable. To stimulate the progress of energy encryption technology and point out security holes, this paper proposes a decryption method for the fundamental principle of encrypted frequency-varying wireless power transfer. The paper uses an auxiliary coil to detect the frequency and a switched-capacitor array to adaptively compensate the receiver for a wide frequency range. The switched-capacitor array contains two capacitors and one semi-conductor switch. One capacitor compensates the receiver all the time while the other's active time during one wireless power transfer cycle is regulated by the switch. Thus, the proposed hacking receiver controls the equivalent capacitance of the compensation and steals energy. Finally, a detailed simulation model and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the attack on frequency-hopping energy encryption. Although any nonnegligible energy extracted would be problematic, we achieved to steal 78% to 84% of the energy an authorized receiver could get. When the frequency changes, the interceptor is coarsely tuned very quickly, which can hack fast frequency-varying encrypted system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Safe Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Optimization of Battery Fast-Charging Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing charging protocols is critical for reducing battery charging time and decelerating battery degradation in applications such as electric vehicles. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been adopted for such purposes. However, RL-based methods may not ensure system (safety) constraints, which can cause irreversible damages to batteries and reduce their lifetime. To this end, this work proposes an adaptive and safe RL framework to optimize fast charging strategies while respecting safety constraints with a high probability. In our method, any unsafe action that the RL agent decides will be projected into a safety region by solving a constrained optimization problem. The safety region is constructed using adaptive Gaussian process (GP) models, consisting of static and dynamic GPs, that learn from online experience to adaptively account for any changes in battery dynamics. Simulation results show that our method can charge the batteries rapidly with constraint satisfaction under varying operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Tracking Real-time Anomalies in Cyber-Physical Systems Through Dynamic Behavioral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased connectivity and remote reprogrammability/reconfigurability features of embedded devices in current-day power systems (including interconnections between information technology -- IT -- and operational technology -- OT -- networks) enable greater agility, reduced operator workload, and enhanced power system performance and capabilities. However, these features also expose a wider cyber-attack surface, underscoring need for robust real-time monitoring and anomaly detection in power systems, and more generally in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The increasingly complex, diverse, and potentially untrustworthy software and hardware supply chains also make need for robust security tools more stringent. We propose a novel framework for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection in CPS, specifically smart grid substations and SCADA systems. The proposed method enables real-time signal temporal logic condition-based anomaly monitoring by processing raw captured packets from the communication network through a hierarchical semantic extraction and tag processing pipeline into time series of semantic events and observations, that are then evaluated against expected temporal properties to detect and localize anomalies. We demonstrate efficacy of our methodology on a hardware in the loop testbed, including multiple physical power equipment (real-time automation controllers and relays) and simulated devices (Phasor Measurement Units -- PMUs, relays, Phasor Data Concentrators -- PDCs), interfaced to a dynamic power system simulator. The performance and accuracy of the proposed system is evaluated on multiple attack scenarios on our testbed.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven predictive control scheme based on measured frequency-domain data of the plant. This novel scheme complements the well-known data-driven predictive control (DeePC) approach based on time series data. To develop this new frequency-domain data-driven predictive control (FreePC) scheme, we introduce a novel version of Willems' fundamental lemma based on frequency-domain data. By exploiting frequency-domain data, we allow recent direct data-driven (predictive) control methodologies to benefit from the available expertise and techniques for non-parametric frequency-domain identification in academia and industry. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the new FreePC scheme is equivalent to the corresponding DeePC scheme. The strengths of FreePC are demonstrated in a numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Conewise Linear Systems with Finitely Many Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate discrete-time conewise linear systems (CLS) for which all the solutions exhibit a finite number of switches. By switches, we mean transitions of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model for which the fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS as all solutions eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing of these conditions, we translate them as a non-negativity test of linear forms using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the non-negativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical non-negativity problem, where any solution to a system must remain non-negative (component-wise) for any non-negative initial condition, and thus requires novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient System Level Tube-MPC for Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tube-based model predictive control (MPC) is the principal robust control technique for constrained linear systems affected by additive disturbances. While tube-based methods that compute the tubes online have been successfully applied to systems with additive disturbances, their application to systems affected by additional model uncertainties is challenging. This paper introduces a new tube-based MPC method - named filter-based system level tube-MPC (SLTMPC) - which overapproximates both uncertainties with an online optimized disturbance set, while simultaneously computing the tube controller online. Extending prior work, we generalize the method to polytopic disturbance sets and for the first time provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees for the receding horizon controller. These guarantees are obtained by virtue of a new terminal controller design and an online optimized terminal set. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method, we additionally introduce an asynchronous computation scheme that separates the optimization of the tube controller and the nominal trajectory. Finally, we provide a comprehensive numerical evaluation of the proposed methods to demonstrate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models based Multi-Agent Framework for Objective Oriented Control Design in Power Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power electronics, a critical component in modern power systems, face several challenges in control design, including model uncertainties, and lengthy and costly design cycles. This paper is aiming to propose a Large Language Models (LLMs) based multi-agent framework for objective-oriented control design in power electronics. The framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and a multi-agent workflow to develop an efficient and autonomous controller design process. The LLM agent is able to understand and respond to high-level instructions in natural language, adapting its behavior based on the task's specific requirements and constraints from a practical implementation point of view. This novel and efficient approach promises a more flexible and adaptable controller design process in power electronics that will largely facilitate the practitioners.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Both Positivity and Stability Using Sector-Bounded Nonlinearity for Systems with Neural Network Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for the stability analysis of positive feedback systems with a class of fully connected feedforward neural networks (FFNN) controllers. By establishing sector bounds for fully connected FFNNs without biases, we present a stability theorem that demonstrates the global exponential stability of linear systems under fully connected FFNN control. Utilizing principles from positive Lur'e systems and the positive Aizerman conjecture, our approach effectively addresses the challenge of ensuring stability in highly nonlinear systems. The crux of our method lies in maintaining sector bounds that preserve the positivity and Hurwitz property of the overall Lur'e system. We showcase the practical applicability of our methodology through its implementation in a linear system managed by a FFNN trained on output feedback controller data, highlighting its potential for enhancing stability in dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting and Securing ML Solutions in Near-RT RIC: A Perspective of an xApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) are emerging as a disruptive technology, revolutionising traditional mobile network architecture and deployments in the current 5G and the upcoming 6G era. Disaggregation of network architecture, inherent support for AI/ML workflows, cloud-native principles, scalability, and interoperability make O-RAN attractive to network providers for beyond-5G and 6G deployments. Notably, the ability to deploy custom applications, including Machine Learning (ML) solutions as xApps or rApps on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), has immense potential for network function and resource optimisation. However, the openness, nascent standards, and distributed architecture of O-RAN and RICs introduce numerous vulnerabilities exploitable through multiple attack vectors, which have not yet been fully explored. To address this gap and ensure robust systems before large-scale deployments, this work analyses the security of ML-based applications deployed on the RIC platform. We focus on potential attacks, defence mechanisms, and pave the way for future research towards a more robust RIC platform.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Information Asymmetry in Two-Stage Contracts with Non-Myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Stackelberg game in which a principal (she) establishes a two-stage contract with a non-myopic agent (he) whose type is unknown. The contract takes the form of an incentive function mapping the agent's first-stage action to his second-stage incentive. While the first-stage action reveals the agent's type under truthful play, a non-myopic agent could benefit from portraying a false type in the first stage to obtain a larger incentive in the second stage. The challenge is thus for the principal to design the incentive function so as to induce truthful play. We show that this is only possible with a constant, non-reactive incentive functions when the type space is continuous, whereas it can be achieved with reactive functions for discrete types. Additionally, we show that introducing an adjustment mechanism that penalizes inconsistent behavior across both stages allows the principal to design more flexible incentive functions.</description>

      <title>Zeroing neural dynamics solving time-variant complex conjugate matrix equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) have aroused the interest of many researchers because of computations and antilinear systems. Existing research is dominated by its time-invariant solving methods, but lacks proposed theories for solving its time-variant version. Moreover, artificial neural networks are rarely studied for solving CCME. In this paper, starting with the earliest CCME, zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) is applied to solve its time-variant version. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 model and Con-CZND2 model are proposed and theoretically prove convergence and effectiveness. Thirdly, three numerical experiments are designed to illustrate the effectiveness of the two models, compare their differences, highlight the significance of neural dynamics in the complex field, and refine the theory related to ZND.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Droop Scheduling in Distribution Grids for Frequency and Local Voltage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for collective control of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in active Distribution Networks (DNs). The proposed approach unifies the commonly employed local (i.e., decentralized) voltage and frequency droop control schemes into a transfer matrix relating frequency and voltage magnitude measurements to active and reactive power injection adjustments. Furthermore, the transfer matrices of individual DER units are adaptively tuned in real-time via slow communication links using a novel online gain scheduling approach to enable primary frequency support provision to the transmission system and ensure that the DN voltages are kept within the allowable limits. A global asymptomatic stability condition of the analyzed droop-controlled DN is analytically established. The considered gain scheduling problem is solved by leveraging an online primal-dual gradient-based method and a suitable linearized power flow model. Additional ancillary service providers can be trivially incorporated into the proposed framework in a plug-and-play fashion. Numerical simulations of the 37-bus IEEE test system and a realistic Swedish 533-bus DN confirm the validity and the scalability of the approach and demonstrate numerous advantages of the proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed model predictive control (MPC) is currently being investigated as a solution to the important control challenge presented by networks of hybrid dynamical systems. However, a benchmark problem for distributed hybrid MPC is absent from the literature. We propose distributed control of a platoon of autonomous vehicles as a comparison benchmark problem. The problem provides a complex and adaptable case study, upon which existing and future approaches to distributed MPC for hybrid systems can be evaluated. Two hybrid modeling frameworks are presented for the vehicle dynamics. Five hybrid MPC controllers are then evaluated and extensively assessed on the fleet of vehicles. Finally, we comment on the need for new efficient and high performing distributed MPC schemes for hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Crowdsourced Shared-Trip Delivery Problem at Scale with a Novel Decomposition Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a set-partitioning formulation and a novel decomposition heuristic (D-H) solution algorithm to solve large-scale instances of the urban crowdsourced shared-trip delivery (CSD) problem. The CSD problem involves dedicated vehicles (DVs) and shared personal vehicles (SPVs) fulfilling delivery orders, wherein the SPVs have their own trip origins and destinations. The D-H begins by assigning as many package delivery orders (PDOs) to SPVs as possible, where the D-H enumerates the set of routes each SPV can feasibly traverse and then solves a PDO-SPV-route assignment problem. For PDO-DV assignment and DV routing, the D-H solves a multi-vehicle routing problem with time-window, tour duration, and capacity constraints using an insertion heuristic. Finally, the D-H seeks potential solution improvements by switching PDOs between SPV and DV routes through a simulated annealing (SA)-inspired procedure. The D-H outperforms a commercial solver in terms of computational efficiency while obtaining near-optimal solutions for small problem instances. The SA-inspired switching procedure outperforms a large neighborhood search algorithm regarding run time, and the two are comparable regarding solution quality. Finally, the paper uses the D-H to analyze the impact of several relevant factors on city-scale CSD system performance, namely the number of participating SPVs and the maximum willingness to detour of SPVs. Consistent with the existing literature, we find that CSD can substantially reduce delivery costs. However, we find that CSD can increase vehicle miles traveled. Our findings provide meaningful insights for logistics practitioners, while the algorithms illustrate promise for large real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized pair-wise logit dynamic and its connection to a mean field game: theoretical and computational investigations focusing on resource management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logit dynamics are evolution equations that describe transitions to equilibria of actions among many players. We formulate a pair-wise logit dynamic in a continuous action space with a generalized exponential function, which we call a generalized pair-wise logit dynamic, depicted by a new evolution equation nonlocal in space. We prove the well-posedness and approximability of the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic to show that it is computationally implementable. We also show that this dynamic has an explicit connection to a mean field game of a controlled pure-jump process, with which the two different mathematical models can be understood in a unified way. Particularly, we show that the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic is derived as a myopic version of the corresponding mean field game, and that the conditions to guarantee the existence of unique solutions are different from each other. The key in this procedure is to find the objective function to be optimized in the mean field game based on the logit function. The monotonicity of the utility is unnecessary for the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic but crucial for the mean field game. Finally, we present applications of the two approaches to fisheries management problems with collected data.</description>

      <title>Online Parameter Estimation for Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of online (real-time, single-shot) estimation of static or slow-varying parameters along quantum trajectories in quantum dynamical systems. Based on the measurement signal of a continuously-monitored quantum system, we propose a recursive algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of unknown parameters using an approach based on stochastic gradient ascent on the log-likelihood function. We formulate the algorithm in both discrete-time and continuous-time and illustrate the performance of the algorithm through simulations of a simple two-level system undergoing homodyne measurement from which we are able to track multiple parameters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A Unified Non-Strict Finsler Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified general non-strict Finsler lemma. This result is general in the sense that it does not impose any restrictions on the involved matrices and, thereby, it encompasses all existing non-strict versions of Finsler's lemma that do impose such restrictions. To further illustrate its usefulness, we showcase applications of the non-strict Finsler's lemma in deriving a structured solution to a special case of the non-strict projection lemma, and we use the unified non-strict Finsler's lemma to prove a more general version of the matrix Finsler's lemma.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Near-Field Coupling in Massive MISO and Massive SIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quadcopter Controller: A Practical Approach and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadcopters have been studied for decades thanks to their maneuverability and capability of operating in a variety of circumstances. However, quadcopters suffer from dynamical nonlinearity, actuator saturation, as well as sensor noise that make it challenging and time consuming to obtain accurate dynamic models and achieve satisfactory control performance. Fortunately, deep reinforcement learning came and has shown significant potential in system modelling and control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles, with recent advancements in deployment, performance enhancement, and generalization. In this paper, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning-based controller for quadcopters is proposed that is secure for real-world implementation, data-efficient, and free of human gain adjustments. First, a novel actor-critic-based architecture is designed to map the robot states directly to the motor outputs. Then, a quadcopter dynamics-based simulator was devised to facilitate the training of the controller policy. Finally, the trained policy is deployed on a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor platform, without any additional fine-tuning process. Experimental results show that the quadcopter exhibits satisfactory performance as it tracks a given complicated trajectory, which demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method and signifies its capability in filling the simulation-to-reality gap.</description>
