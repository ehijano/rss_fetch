      <title>Remastering Divide and Remaster: A Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset with Multilingual Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cinematic audio source separation (CASS) is a relatively new subtask of audio source separation, concerned with the separation of a mixture into the dialogue, music, and effects stems. To date, only one publicly available dataset exists for CASS, that is, the Divide and Remaster (DnR) dataset, which is currently at version 2. While DnR v2 has been an incredibly useful resource for CASS, several areas of improvement have been identified, particularly through its use in the 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge. In this work, we develop version 3 of the DnR dataset, addressing issues relating to vocal content in non-dialogue stems, loudness distributions, mastering process, and linguistic diversity. In particular, the dialogue stem of DnR v3 includes speech content from more than 30 languages from multiple families including but not limited to the Germanic, Romance, Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Malayo-Polynesian, and Bantu families. Benchmark results using the Bandit model indicated that training on multilingual data yields significant generalizability to the model even in languages with low data availability. Even in languages with high data availability, the multilingual model often performs on par or better than dedicated models trained on monolingual CASS datasets.</description>

      <title>AVCap: Leveraging Audio-Visual Features as Text Tokens for Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07801v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in representation learning and language models have propelled Automated Captioning (AC) to new heights, enabling the generation of human-level descriptions. Leveraging these advancements, we propose AVCap, an Audio-Visual Captioning framework, a simple yet powerful baseline approach applicable to audio-visual captioning. AVCap utilizes audio-visual features as text tokens, which has many advantages not only in performance but also in the extensibility and scalability of the model. AVCap is designed around three pivotal dimensions: the exploration of optimal audio-visual encoder architectures, the adaptation of pre-trained models according to the characteristics of generated text, and the investigation into the efficacy of modality fusion in captioning. Our method outperforms existing audio-visual captioning methods across all metrics and the code is available on https://github.com/JongSuk1/AVCap</description>

      <title>Speech After Gender: A Trans-Feminine Perspective on Next Steps for Speech Science and Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As experts in voice modification, trans-feminine gender-affirming voice teachers have unique perspectives on voice that confound current understandings of speaker identity. To demonstrate this, we present the Versatile Voice Dataset (VVD), a collection of three speakers modifying their voices along gendered axes. The VVD illustrates that current approaches in speaker modeling, based on categorical notions of gender and a static understanding of vocal texture, fail to account for the flexibility of the vocal tract. Utilizing publicly-available speaker embeddings, we demonstrate that gender classification systems are highly sensitive to voice modification, and speaker verification systems fail to identify voices as coming from the same speaker as voice modification becomes more drastic. As one path towards moving beyond categorical and static notions of speaker identity, we propose modeling individual qualities of vocal texture such as pitch, resonance, and weight.</description>

      <title>SimuSOE: A Simulated Snoring Dataset for Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome Evaluation during Wakefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a prevalent chronic breathing disorder caused by upper airway obstruction. Previous studies advanced OSAHS evaluation through machine learning-based systems trained on sleep snoring or speech signal datasets. However, constructing datasets for training a precise and rapid OSAHS evaluation system poses a challenge, since 1) it is time-consuming to collect sleep snores and 2) the speech signal is limited in reflecting upper airway obstruction. In this paper, we propose a new snoring dataset for OSAHS evaluation, named SimuSOE, in which a novel and time-effective snoring collection method is introduced for tackling the above problems. In particular, we adopt simulated snoring which is a type of snore intentionally emitted by patients to replace natural snoring. Experimental results indicate that the simulated snoring signal during wakefulness can serve as an effective feature in OSAHS preliminary screening.</description>

      <title>STONE: Self-supervised Tonality Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks can estimate the key of a musical piece, their supervision incurs a massive annotation effort. Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator. The architecture behind STONE, named ChromaNet, is a convnet with octave equivalence which outputs a key signature profile (KSP) of 12 structured logits. First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature. Applying different amounts of supervision yields semi-supervised and fully supervised tonality estimators: i.e., Semi-TONEs and Sup-TONEs. We evaluate these estimators on FMAK, a new dataset of 5489 real-world musical recordings with expert annotation of 24 major and minor keys. We find that Semi-TONE matches the classification accuracy of Sup-TONE with reduced supervision and outperforms it with equal supervision.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution generalisation in spoken language understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test data is said to be out-of-distribution (OOD) when it unexpectedly differs from the training data, a common challenge in real-world use cases of machine learning. Although OOD generalisation has gained interest in recent years, few works have focused on OOD generalisation in spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks. To facilitate research on this topic, we introduce a modified version of the popular SLU dataset SLURP, featuring data splits for testing OOD generalisation in the SLU task. We call our modified dataset SLURP For OOD generalisation, or SLURPFOOD. Utilising our OOD data splits, we find end-to-end SLU models to have limited capacity for generalisation. Furthermore, by employing model interpretability techniques, we shed light on the factors contributing to the generalisation difficulties of the models. To improve the generalisation, we experiment with two techniques, which improve the results on some, but not all the splits, emphasising the need for new techniques.</description>

      <title>Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>

      <title>Beat-It: Beat-Synchronized Multi-Condition 3D Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dance, as an art form, fundamentally hinges on the precise synchronization with musical beats. However, achieving aesthetically pleasing dance sequences from music is challenging, with existing methods often falling short in controllability and beat alignment. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Beat-It, a novel framework for beat-specific, key pose-guided dance generation. Unlike prior approaches, Beat-It uniquely integrates explicit beat awareness and key pose guidance, effectively resolving two main issues: the misalignment of generated dance motions with musical beats, and the inability to map key poses to specific beats, critical for practical choreography. Our approach disentangles beat conditions from music using a nearest beat distance representation and employs a hierarchical multi-condition fusion mechanism. This mechanism seamlessly integrates key poses, beats, and music features, mitigating condition conflicts and offering rich, multi-conditioned guidance for dance generation. Additionally, a specially designed beat alignment loss ensures the generated dance movements remain in sync with the designated beats. Extensive experiments confirm Beat-It's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of beat alignment and motion controllability.</description>

      <title>HebDB: a Weakly Supervised Dataset for Hebrew Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HebDB, a weakly supervised dataset for spoken language processing in the Hebrew language. HebDB offers roughly 2500 hours of natural and spontaneous speech recordings in the Hebrew language, consisting of a large variety of speakers and topics. We provide raw recordings together with a pre-processed, weakly supervised, and filtered version. The goal of HebDB is to further enhance research and development of spoken language processing tools for the Hebrew language. Hence, we additionally provide two baseline systems for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): (i) a self-supervised model; and (ii) a fully supervised model. We present the performance of these two methods optimized on HebDB and compare them to current multi-lingual ASR alternatives. Results suggest the proposed method reaches better results than the evaluated baselines considering similar model sizes. Dataset, code, and models are publicly available under https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/HebDB/.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law in Neural Data: Non-Invasive Speech Decoding with 175 Hours of EEG Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold great potential for aiding individuals with speech impairments. Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs.</description>

      <title>Targeted Augmented Data for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of highly convincing audio deepfake generators highlights the need for designing robust audio deepfake detectors. Existing works often rely solely on real and fake data available in the training set, which may lead to overfitting, thereby reducing the robustness to unseen manipulations. To enhance the generalization capabilities of audio deepfake detectors, we propose a novel augmentation method for generating audio pseudo-fakes targeting the decision boundary of the model. Inspired by adversarial attacks, we perturb original real data to synthesize pseudo-fakes with ambiguous prediction probabilities. Comprehensive experiments on two well-known architectures demonstrate that the proposed augmentation contributes to improving the generalization capabilities of these architectures.</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Based on Feature Disentanglement and Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice in a given music piece to another singer while keeping the original content. We propose an end-to-end feature disentanglement-based model, which we named SaMoye, to enable zero-shot many-to-many singing voice conversion. SaMoye disentangles the features of the singing voice into content features, timbre features, and pitch features respectively. The content features are enhanced using a GPT-based model to perform cross-prediction with the phoneme of the lyrics. SaMoye can generate the music with converted voice by replacing the timbre features with the target singer. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance. The dataset consists of 1500k pure singing vocal clips containing at least 10,000 singers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to generate clean speech frame by frame from a live video stream and a noisy audio stream without relying on future inputs. To this end, we propose RT-LA-VocE, which completely re-designs every component of LA-VocE, a state-of-the-art non-causal audio-visual speech enhancement model, to perform causal real-time inference with a 40ms input frame. We do so by devising new visual and audio encoders that rely solely on past frames, replacing the Transformer encoder with the Emformer, and designing a new causal neural vocoder C-HiFi-GAN. On the popular AVSpeech dataset, we show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in all real-time scenarios. More importantly, each component is carefully tuned to minimize the algorithm latency to the theoretical minimum (40ms) while maintaining a low end-to-end processing latency of 28.15ms per frame, enabling real-time frame-by-frame enhancement with minimal delay.</description>

      <title>Testing Speech Emotion Recognition Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for speech emotion recognition (SER) can be trained for different tasks and are usually evaluated on the basis of a few available datasets per task. Tasks could include arousal, valence, dominance, emotional categories, or tone of voice. Those models are mainly evaluated in terms of correlation or recall, and always show some errors in their predictions. The errors manifest themselves in model behaviour, which can be very different along different dimensions even if the same recall or correlation is achieved by the model. This paper introduces a testing framework to investigate behaviour of speech emotion recognition models, by requiring different metrics to reach a certain threshold in order to pass a test. The test metrics can be grouped in terms of correctness, fairness, and robustness. It further provides a method to specify test thresholds for fairness tests automatically, based on the used datasets, and recommendations how to select the remaining test thresholds. Seven different transformer based models, and a baseline model are tested for arousal, valence, dominance, and emotional categories. The test results highlight, that models with high correlation or recall might rely on shortcuts - such as text sentiment - to achieve this, and differ in terms of fairness.</description>

      <title>Seed-ASR: Understanding Diverse Speech and Contexts with LLM-based Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) model is required to accurately transcribe diverse speech signals (from different domains, languages, accents, etc) given the specific contextual information in various application scenarios. Classic end-to-end models fused with extra language models perform well, but mainly in data matching scenarios and are gradually approaching a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Seed-ASR, a large language model (LLM) based speech recognition model. Seed-ASR is developed based on the framework of audio conditioned LLM (AcLLM), leveraging the capabilities of LLMs by inputting continuous speech representations together with contextual information into the LLM. Through stage-wise large-scale training and the elicitation of context-aware capabilities in LLM, Seed-ASR demonstrates significant improvement over end-to-end models on comprehensive evaluation sets, including multiple domains, accents/dialects and languages. Additionally, Seed-ASR can be further deployed to support specific needs in various scenarios without requiring extra language models. Compared to recently released large ASR models, Seed-ASR achieves 10%-40% reduction in word (or character, for Chinese) error rates on Chinese and English public test sets, further demonstrating its powerful performance.</description>

      <title>A noise-robust acoustic method for recognizing foraging activities of grazing cattle</title>

Abstract: Farmers must continuously improve their livestock production systems to remain competitive in the growing dairy market. Precision livestock farming technologies provide individualized monitoring of animals on commercial farms, optimizing livestock production. Continuous acoustic monitoring is a widely accepted sensing technique used to estimate the daily rumination and grazing time budget of free-ranging cattle. However, typical environmental and natural noises on pastures noticeably affect the performance limiting the practical application of current acoustic methods. In this study, we present the operating principle and generalization capability of an acoustic method called Noise-Robust Foraging Activity Recognizer (NRFAR). The proposed method determines foraging activity bouts by analyzing fixed-length segments of identified jaw movement events produced during grazing and rumination. The additive noise robustness of the NRFAR was evaluated for several signal-to-noise ratios using stationary Gaussian white noise and four different nonstationary natural noise sources. In noiseless conditions, NRFAR reached an average balanced accuracy of 86.4%, outperforming two previous acoustic methods by more than 7.5%. Furthermore, NRFAR performed better than previous acoustic methods in 77 of 80 evaluated noisy scenarios (53 cases with p&lt;0.05). NRFAR has been shown to be effective in harsh free-ranging environments and could be used as a reliable solution to improve pasture management and monitor the health and welfare of dairy cows.

      <title>DistriBlock: Identifying adversarial audio samples by leveraging characteristics of the output distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17000v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks can mislead automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems into predicting an arbitrary target text, thus posing a clear security threat. To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step. Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks. Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively. To assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.</description>

      <title>Objective and subjective evaluation of speech enhancement methods in the UDASE task of the 7th CHiME challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised models for speech enhancement are trained using artificially generated mixtures of clean speech and noise signals. However, the synthetic training conditions may not accurately reflect real-world conditions encountered during testing. This discrepancy can result in poor performance when the test domain significantly differs from the synthetic training domain. To tackle this issue, the UDASE task of the 7th CHiME challenge aimed to leverage real-world noisy speech recordings from the test domain for unsupervised domain adaptation of speech enhancement models. Specifically, this test domain corresponds to the CHiME-5 dataset, characterized by real multi-speaker and conversational speech recordings made in noisy and reverberant domestic environments, for which ground-truth clean speech signals are not available. In this paper, we present the objective and subjective evaluations of the systems that were submitted to the CHiME-7 UDASE task, and we provide an analysis of the results. This analysis reveals a limited correlation between subjective ratings and several supervised nonintrusive performance metrics recently proposed for speech enhancement. Conversely, the results suggest that more traditional intrusive objective metrics can be used for in-domain performance evaluation using the reverberant LibriCHiME-5 dataset developed for the challenge. The subjective evaluation indicates that all systems successfully reduced the background noise, but always at the expense of increased distortion. Out of the four speech enhancement methods evaluated subjectively, only one demonstrated an improvement in overall quality compared to the unprocessed noisy speech, highlighting the difficulty of the task. The tools and audio material created for the CHiME-7 UDASE task are shared with the community.</description>

      <title>Transforming LLMs into Cross-modal and Cross-lingual Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on text-only data that go far beyond the languages with paired speech and text data. At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn't require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM's multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training. Our multi-modal LLM-based retrieval system is capable of matching speech and text in 102 languages despite only training on 21 languages. Our system outperforms previous systems trained explicitly on all 102 languages. We achieve a 10% absolute improvement in Recall@1 averaged across these languages. Additionally, our model demonstrates cross-lingual speech and text matching, which is further enhanced by readily available machine translation data.</description>

      <title>A Mel Spectrogram Enhancement Paradigm Based on CWT in Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic features play an important role in improving the quality of the synthesised speech. Currently, the Mel spectrogram is a widely employed acoustic feature in most acoustic models. However, due to the fine-grained loss caused by its Fourier transform process, the clarity of speech synthesised by Mel spectrogram is compromised in mutant signals. In order to obtain a more detailed Mel spectrogram, we propose a Mel spectrogram enhancement paradigm based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). This paradigm introduces an additional task: a more detailed wavelet spectrogram, which like the post-processing network takes as input the Mel spectrogram output by the decoder. We choose Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2 for experimental validation in order to test autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech systems, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the speech synthesised using the model with the Mel spectrogram enhancement paradigm exhibits higher MOS, with an improvement of 0.14 and 0.09 compared to the baseline model, respectively. These findings provide some validation for the universality of the enhancement paradigm, as they demonstrate the success of the paradigm in different architectures.</description>
