      <title>Detection of a 2.85 micrometer Feature on 5 Spinel-rich Asteroids from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based observations of `Barbarian' L-type asteroids at 1 to 2.5-$\mu$m indicate that their near-infrared spectra are dominated by the mineral spinel, which has been attributed to a high abundance of calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) -- the first solids to condense out of the protoplanetary disk during the formation of the Solar System. However, the spectral properties of these asteroids from 2.5 to 5-$\mu$m, a wavelength region that covers signatures of hydrated minerals, water, and organics, have not yet been explored. Here, we present 2 to 5-$\mu$m reflectance spectra of five spinel-rich asteroids obtained with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. All five targets exhibit a $\sim$ 2.85-$\mu$m absorption feature with a band depth of 3-6$\%$ that appears correlated in strength with that of the 2-$\mu$m spinel absorption feature. The shape and position of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature are not a good match to the 2.7-$\mu$m feature commonly seen in carbonaceous CM meteorites or C-type asteroids. The closest spectral matches are to the Moon and Vesta, suggesting commonalities in aqueous alteration across silicate bodies, infall of hydrated material, and/or space weathering by solar wind H implantation. Lab spectra of CO/CV chondrites, CAIs, as well as the minerals cronstedtite and spinel, also show a similar feature, providing clues into the origin of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature.</description>

      <title>Widespread disruption of resonant chains during protoplanetary disk dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low mass planets in a dispersing protoplanetary disk around a Solar mass star. The disk model is based on the results of Yu, Hansen &amp; Hasegawa (2023), which describes a region of the inner disk where the direction of the migration torque is outwards due to the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk and the resultant gradual increase in surface density outwards. We demonstrate that the magnetospheric rebound phase in such a disk leads to diverging orbits for double and triple planet systems, and the disruption of a high fraction of the initial resonant chains.
  We present simulations of three planet systems with masses based on the observed triple planet systems observed by the Kepler satellite within the context of this model. The final distribution of nearest neighbour period ratios provides an excellent fit to the observations, provided that the initial resonant configurations are compact. The occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period also provides a good match to the observations, for final orbital periods P&lt;20 days.
  These results suggest that the period and period ratio distributions of low mass planets are primarily set in place during the disk dispersal epoch, and may not require significant dynamical evolution thereafter.</description>

      <title>HD 110067 c has an aligned orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary systems in mean motion resonances hold a special place among the planetary population. They allow us to study planet formation in great detail as dissipative processes are thought to have played an important role in their existence. Additionally, planetary masses in bright resonant systems may be independently measured both by radial velocities (RVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs). In principle, they also allow us to quickly determine the inclination of all planets in the system, as for the system to be stable, they are likely all in coplanar orbits. To describe the full dynamical state of the system, we also need the stellar obliquity that provides the orbital alignment of a planet with respect to the spin of their host star and can be measured thanks to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It was recently discovered that HD 110067 harbours a system of six sub-Neptunes in resonant chain orbits. We here analyze an ESPRESSO high-resolution spectroscopic time series of HD 110067 during the transit of planet c. We find the orbit of HD 110067 c to be well aligned with sky projected obliquity $\lambda =6^{+24}_{-26}$ deg. This result is indicative that the current architecture of the system has been reached through convergent migration without any major disruptive events. Finally, we report transit-timing variation in this system as we find a significant offset of 19 $\pm$ 4 minutes in the center of the transit compared to the published ephemeris.</description>

      <title>The TESS-Keck Survey. XXII. A sub-Neptune Orbiting TOI-1437</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet discoveries have revealed a dramatic diversity of planet sizes across a vast array of orbital architectures. Sub-Neptunes are of particular interest; due to their absence in our own solar system, we rely on demographics of exoplanets to better understand their bulk composition and formation scenarios. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of TOI-1437 b, a sub-Neptune with a 18.84 day orbit around a near-Solar analog (Mstar = 1.10 +/- 0.10 Msun, Rstar = 1.17 +/- 0.12 Rsun). The planet was detected using photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and radial velocity follow-up observations were carried out as a part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) using both the HIRES instrument at Keck Observatory and the Levy Spectrograph on the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope. A combined analysis of these data reveal a planet radius of Rp = 2.24 +/- 0.23 Rearth and a mass measurement of Mp = 9.6 +/- 3.9 Mearth). TOI-1437 b is one of few (~50) known transiting sub-Neptunes orbiting a solar-mass star that has a radial velocity mass measurement. As the formation pathway of these worlds remains an unanswered question, the precise mass characterization of TOI-1437 b may provide further insight into this class of planet.</description>

      <title>V892 Tau: A tidally perturbed circumbinary disc in a triple stellar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V892 Tau is a young binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc which show hints of interaction with the low-mass nearby star V892 Tau NE. The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60{\deg} with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt. In order to explain most of the features of the circumbinary disc, we propose that V892 Tau NE follows a misaligned eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.5 and a mutual inclination between 30{\deg} and 60{\deg}. Such a misaligned companion suggests the disc is oscillating and precessing with time, stabilising in an intermediate plane with a non-zero mutual inclination with the inner binary. Given that orbital configuration, we show that the stability of future planets is compromised in the second half of the disc once the gas has dissipated.</description>

      <title>The Discovery and Follow-up of Four Transiting Short-period Sub-Neptunes Orbiting M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with $2-3R_\oplus$ are intermediate in size between rocky planets and Neptune-sized planets. The orbital properties and bulk compositions of transiting sub-Neptunes provide clues to the formation and evolution of close-in small planets. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up of four sub-Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs (TOI-782, TOI-1448, TOI-2120, and TOI-2406), three of which were newly validated by ground-based follow-up observations and statistical analyses. TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b have radii of $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.740^{+0.082}_{-0.079}\,R_\oplus$, $2.769^{+0.073}_{-0.068}\,R_\oplus$, $2.120\pm0.067\,R_\oplus$, and $2.830^{+0.068}_{-0.066}\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods of $P = 8.02$, $8.11$, $5.80$, and $3.08$\,days, respectively. Doppler monitoring with Subaru/InfraRed Doppler instrument led to 2$\sigma$ upper limits on the masses of $&lt;19.1\ M_\oplus$, $&lt;19.5\ M_\oplus$, $&lt;6.8\ M_\oplus$, and $&lt;15.6\ M_\oplus$ for TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b, respectively. The mass-radius relationship of these four sub-Neptunes testifies to the existence of volatile material in their interiors. These four sub-Neptunes, which are located above the so-called ``radius valley'', are likely to retain a significant atmosphere and/or an icy mantle on the core, such as a water world. We find that at least three of the four sub-Neptunes (TOI-782 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b) orbiting M dwarfs older than 1 Gyr, are likely to have eccentricities of $e \sim 0.2-0.3$. The fact that tidal circularization of their orbits is not achieved over 1 Gyr suggests inefficient tidal dissipation in their interiors.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study on retrieving exoplanetary cloud cover distributions using polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. As a new growing field, exocartography aims to map the surface features of exoplanets that are beyond the resolution of traditional observing techniques. While photometric approaches have been discussed extensively, polarimetry has received less attention despite its promising prospects.
  Aims. We demonstrate that the limb polarization of an exoplanetary atmosphere offers valuable insights into its cloud cover distribution. Specifically, we determine an upper limit for the polarimetric precision, which is required to extract information about the latitudinal cloud cover of temperate Jovian planets for scenarios of observations with and without host stars.
  Methods. To compute the scattered stellar radiation of an exoplanetary atmosphere and to study the polarization at various planetary phase angles, we used the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS.
  Results. When the planetary signal can be measured separately from the stellar radiation, information about the latitudinal cloud cover for polar cap models is accessible at polarimetric sensitivities of $0.1$ %. In contrast, a precision of about $10^{-3}$ ppm is required when the stellar flux is included to gain this information.</description>

      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterisation and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>

      <title>Verification of astrometrically accelerating stars from Hipparcos and Gaia: I. Methodology and application to HIP 44842</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of candidate binary stars with apparent acceleration on the sky has emerged from analysis of astrometric data collected by the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Gaia space missions. Although the apparent acceleration can serve as a relatively reliable indicator of binarity, it provides scarce information about the orbital and physical parameters of the components. With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements. In this paper, we review the necessary steps in this implementation and describe the improved Hipparcos-Gaia sample of long-term astrometric accelerations which includes correction of sky-correlated systematic errors using the vector spherical decomposition method. As an example, we study one Hipparcos star with a large acceleration, HIP 44842, where the companion is revealed to be a normal main sequence star.</description>

      <title>No signature of the birth environment of exoplanets from their host stars' Mahalanobis phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.</description>

      <title>A Quick Guide to Nearby Young Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearby associations of stars which are coeval are important benchmark laboratories because they provide robust measurements of stellar ages. The study of such coeval groups makes it possible to better understand star formation by studying the initial mass function, the binary fraction or the circumstellar disks of stars, to determine how the initially dense populations of young stars gradually disperse to form the field population, and to shed light on how the properties of stars, exoplanets and substellar objects evolve with distinct snapshots along their lifetime. The advent of large-scale missions such as Gaia is reshaping our understanding or stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood and beyond, and offers the opportunity to detect a large number of loose, coeval stellar associations for the first time, which evaded prior detection because of their low density or the faintness of their members. In parallel, advances in detection and characterization of exoplanets and substellar objects are starting to unveil the detailed properties of extrasolar atmospheres, as well as population-level distributions in fundamental exoplanet properties such as radii, masses, and orbital parameters. Accurate ages are still sparsely available to interpret the evolution of both exoplanets and substellar objects, and both fields are now ripe for detailed age investigations because we are starting to uncover ever-closer low-density associations that previously escaped detection, as well as exoplanets and ever lower-mass members of more distant open clusters and star-forming regions. In this paper, we review some recent advances in the identification and characterization of nearby associations, the methods by which stellar ages are measured, and some of the direct applications of the study of young associations such as the emergent field of isolated planetary-mass objects.</description>

Abstract: Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection (with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes)}. This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity - because of an increase of low-level cloudiness - and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.</description>

      <title>Measuring White Dwarf Variability from Sparsely Sampled Gaia DR3 Multi-Epoch Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 d and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 min), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target sample, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 min eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.</description>
