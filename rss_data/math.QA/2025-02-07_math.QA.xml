      <title>Derived representations of quantum character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum moduli algebras $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{\mathrm{inv}}(H)$ were introduced by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus and Buffenoir-Roche in the context of quantization of character varieties of surfaces and exist for any quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$. In this paper we construct representations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{\mathrm{inv}}(H)$ on cohomology spaces $\mathrm{Ext}_H^m(X,M)$ for all $m \geq 0$, where $X$ is any $H$-module and $M$ is any $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$-module endowed with a compatible $H$-module structure. As a corollary and under suitable assumptions on $H$, we obtain projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces on such Ext spaces. This recovers the projective representations constructed by Lentner-Mierach-Schweigert-Sommerh\"auser from Lyubashenko theory, when the category $\mathcal{C} = H\text{-}\mathrm{mod}$ is used in their construction. Other topological applications are matrix-valued invariants of knots in thickened surfaces and representations of skein algebras on Ext spaces.</description>

      <title>Second bounded cohomology of knot quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bounded cohomology of quandles and its applications to knot theory. We establish two key results that provide sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of the second bounded cohomology of quandles. The first condition involves a subspace of homogeneous group quasimorphisms on the inner automorphism group of the quandle, whereas the second condition concerns the vanishing of the stable commutator length on a subgroup of this inner automorphism group. As topological applications, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the quandle of any non-split link whose link group is non-solvable as well as the quandle of any split link, is infinite dimensional. From these results, we conclude that the second bounded cohomology of the knot quandle can be used to detect the unknot. On the algebraic side, we prove that the second bounded cohomology of a free product of quandles is infinite dimensional if the inner automorphism group of at least one of the free factors is amenable. This leads to the result that the second bounded cohomology of free quandles of rank greater than one, as well as their canonical quotients, is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>An analytic characterization of freeness for finitely generated discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a freer quantum group has smaller moments of the self-adjoint main character in the category of finitely generated discrete quantum groups. As a result, the moments are minimized precisely by the unitary free quantum groups $\mathbb{F}U(Q)$. Furthermore, in the spirit of [CC22], we prove that the operator norm of the self-adjoint main character is minimized only by unitary free quantum groups, at least in the subcategory of duals of free quantum groups of Kac type.</description>

      <title>Division algebras in monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work adapts the equivalent definitions of division algebras over a field into multiple types of division algebras in a monoidal category. Examples and consequences of these definitions are then established in various monoidal settings.</description>

      <title>On deformation quantization of the space of connections on a two manifold and Chern Simons Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use recent progress on Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions [18] to give explicit, closed form formulas for the star product on some functions on the affine space ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma)$ of (smooth) connections on the trivialized principal $G$-bundle on a compact, oriented two manifold $\Sigma.$ These formulas give a close relation between knot invariants, such as the Kauffman bracket polynomial, and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, arising in Chern Simons gauge theory, and deformation quantization of ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma).$ This relation echoes the relation between the manifold invariants of Witten [20] and Reshetikhin-Turaev [16] and {\em geometric} quantization of this space (or its symplectic quotient by the action of the gauge group). In our case this relation arises from explicit algebraic formulas arising from the (mathematically well-defined) functional integrals of [18].</description>
