      <title>A universal sum over topologies in 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the sum over topologies in AdS$_3$ quantum gravity and its relationship with the statistical interpretation of the boundary theory. We formulate a statistical version of the conformal bootstrap that systematizes the universal statistical properties of high-energy CFT$_2$ data. We identify a series of surgery moves on bulk manifolds that precisely reflect the requirements of typicality and crossing symmetry of the boundary ensemble. These surgery moves generate a large number of bulk manifolds that have to be included in any reasonable definition of the gravitational path integral. We show that this procedure generates only on-shell (hyperbolic) manifolds, although it does not produce all of them. These proofs rely on structure theorems of 3-manifolds, which non-trivially interact with the requirements of the statistical boundary ensemble. We illustrate the application of this procedure with many examples, such as Euclidean wormholes, twisted $I$-bundles and handlebody-knots. Our findings reveal a large space of possible choices of which manifolds can be included in the gravitational path integral, reflecting a wide range of possible statistical ensembles consistent with crossing symmetry and typicality.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy is von Neumann Entropy II: The complete symmetry group and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the algebra of observables of perturbative quantum gravity in the exterior of a stationary black hole or the static patch of de Sitter spacetime. It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding "dressed" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., "edge modes" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional "boost supertranslation" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any "semiclassical state" is the generalized entropy with an additional "edge mode" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized "observer". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the "shape" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state.</description>

      <title>Unimodular time in JT gravity: a holographic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How is a ''bulk clock'' encoded holographically? We address this in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where a natural physical clock emerges by promoting the vacuum energy to a dynamical variable: the vacuum cosmological constant becomes a top form degree of freedom conjugate to spacetime volume, thereby defining a notion of bulk physical time. This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit.</description>

      <title>Subregion algebras in classical and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinematics and dynamics of subregion algebras in classical and perturbative quantum gravity associated with portions of null surfaces such as event horizons and finite causal diamonds. We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons. Lastly, we use gravitational half-sided modular inclusion algebras to prove the quantum focusing conjecture in the perturbative quantum gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Note on Pure D-brane (non--)BPS Black Hole Microstate Counting in Type IIA Superstring Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we explore computational algebraic geometry techniques to compute $14^{th}$ Helicity Trace Index of 4--charge, $\frac{1}{8}$--BPS, $\mathcal{N}=8$ pure D-brane configurations dual to D1--D5--P--KK monopole dyonic black holes. We extend the analysis of our previous work \cite{Chowdhury:2023wss} to higher values of charges and fix subtleties involving compatible gauge choices for $(1,1,1,N)$ charge configurations. For explicit SUSY state counting, we use a parametric monodromy method for the 4--charge $(1,1,1,5)$ and $(1,1,1,6)$ configurations and find that the results match the U--dual picture. By a different choice of the R--symmetry representations, it is possible to explicitly break all supersymmetry and study (non--)abelian static matrix models versions as 4--charge non--BPS pure D-brane systems \cite{Mondal:2024qyn}. Using analytical Gr\"{o}bner bases we show that the potential has no zero energy configuration. The higher end of the spectrum asymptotes towards the Coulomb branch local minima manifold representing unbounded D--brane configurations, and the Mixed branch global minima represent bound states at parametrically lower values of the potential. We developed physics--inspired computational techniques to deform the potentials and lift the flat directions, thereby counting the low--energy states with degeneracy.</description>

      <title>A Scattering Transform for Noncommutative Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Maximal trombone supergravity from wrapped M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new family of maximal supergravities in four dimensions, involving gaugings of the trombone scaling symmetry, has been recently introduced. Using exceptional generalised geometry, we show some supergravities in this class to arise by consistent truncation of $D=11$ supergravity. The seven-dimensional reduction manifold is locally equivalent to the topologically-twisted internal manifold of the AdS$_4$ geometries that arise near the horizon of M5-branes wrapped on supersymmetric three-cycles of special holonomy manifolds. The dimensional reduction involves a mixture of conventional and generalised Scherk-Schwarz prescriptions, and provides the first maximally supersymmetric consistent truncation to four dimensions in the context of the M5-brane.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity at large scales on quantum spacetime in the IKKT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational dynamics of 3+1 dimensional covariant quantum spacetime in the IKKT or IIB matrix model is studied at one loop, combining the Yang-Mills-type matrix action with the induced Einstein-Hilbert action. This combined action leads to interesting modifications of the gravitational dynamics at long distances, governed by modified Einstein equations including an extra geometrical tensor interpreted as ''mirage matter''. In particular we find extra non-Ricci flat geometric modes with a non-standard dispersion relation, with features reminiscent of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Resumming Scattering Amplitudes for Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a two-body system moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Importantly, our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the detailed structure of the topological character of the instantons in pure Yang-Mills theory on $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^3$, so-called calorons. The claim is that the standard formula for the topological character, the second Chern number, requires some modification through analytic consideration. For concreteness, we explicitly calculate the second Chern number of the gauge configuration of the Harrington-Shepard type with unit topological charge of the gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ in several gauges. The genuine formula is shown to be applicable even though the gauge connection is in singular gauge. The gauge dependence of the magnetic charge is also discussed.</description>

      <title>On theta function expressions of cyclic products of fermion correlation functions in genus two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript.</description>

      <title>On equivalent methods for functional determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity of Krylov Complexity for Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians factorise as tensor products. We prove that complexity is superadditive under tensor products, $C_{12}\ge C_1+C_2$, and identify a positive operator that quantifies the resulting excess complexity. The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dimensional lattice whose diagonal shells encode operator growth and binomial path multiplicities. In the continuum limit, Krylov dynamics reduces to diffusion on this graph, with superadditivity arising from geometric broadening across shells. Explicit examples illustrate how deviations from synchronous evolution generate bounded, oscillatory excess complexity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Lorentzian replica framework for computing entanglement entropy to fully time-dependent gravitational settings, with emphasis on cosmological spacetimes without boundaries and gravitational theories lacking a dual quantum field theory description. Our approach constructs the replica path integral directly in real time, avoiding reliance on Euclidean continuation or time-reflection symmetry, and identifies the geometric conditions under which Lorentzian replica saddles appear in dynamical backgrounds. We analyze replica wormholes in both contexts, recovering a generalized version of the island rule. For completeness, we provide a concise review of the existing Lorentzian replica construction for quantum field theories and their holographic duals, which forms the foundation for our generalization.</description>

Abstract: The exact localization result for the expectation value of the $1\over 2$ BPS circular Wilson loop in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory is given in the planar limit by the famous Bessel function expression: $\langle W\rangle = {2N\over \sqrt \lambda } I_1 ( \sqrt \lambda)$. Expanded in large $\lambda$ and expressed in terms of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ string tension $T= {\sqrt \lambda \over 2\pi}$ this gives $\langle W\rangle = {\sqrt T\over 2\pi g_s} e^{2\pi T} (1- {3\over 16 \pi} T^{-1} + ...)$.The exponential is matched by the value of the action of the string with the AdS$_2$ world volume while the prefactor comes from the 1-loop GS string correction. Here we address the question of how the subleading $T^{-1}$ term could be reproduced by the 2-loop correction in the corresponding partition function of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ GS string expanded near the AdS$_2$ minimal surface. We find that the string correction contains a non-zero UV logarithmic divergence implying that comparison with the SYM result requires a particular subtraction prescription. We discuss implications of this conclusion for checking the AdS/CFT duality at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Minimal Modular Flavor Symmetry and Lepton Textures Near Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24804v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model with $\Gamma_2\simeq S_3$ modular flavor symmetry is presented. We consider the construction of the lepton sector, augmented by two right-handed neutrino states, in the vicinity of the fixed points $\tau = i\infty $ and $\tau = i$. Due to the residual symmetries at these points, and with the aid of non-holomorphic modular forms (which constitute representations of $S_3$) and by assigning specific transformation properties to the fermion fields, highly economical models (without flavon fields) are constructed with interesting Yukawa textures. All presented models strongly prefer the inverted ordering for the neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformed $\mathfrak{g}_2$ exceptional applications are introduced via the Clifford algebra-parametrized formalism. Using the products between multivectors of $\cl_{0,7}$, the Clifford algebra over the metric vector space $\RR^{0,7}$, and octonions, resulting in an octonion, we generalize the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ applications, also associated with the transformation rules for bosonic and fermionic fields on the 7-sphere $S^7$. The emergence of $SU(3)$-like subalgebras within the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ provides an algebraic framework reminiscent of the $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What flavour structure of $t$-channel thermal dark matter remains compatible with current flavour physics and direct detection bounds? We broadly chart the space of hypotheses using the framework of flavour symmetries and their breaking patterns. We then focus on scenarios in which the fermionic dark matter and its scalar mediator are flavour singlets, falling into the class of rank-1 flavour violation. For two representative benchmarks, quarkphilic ($q_L$) and leptophilic ($e_R$), we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis, fitting the relic abundance and examining the interplay among flavour observables, direct detection, and collider searches. Our results quantify the allowed deviations from flavour-symmetric limits and assess the discovery prospects in future flavour and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary boundary correlations at deconfined quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing appreciation for the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on gapless boundary degrees of freedom. Here we consider the boundary dynamics of the non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (NCCP$^{N-1}$) model in two spatial dimensions, with $N$ complex boson species coupled to a fluctuating $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field. These models describe quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm, such as the deconfined quantum critical point between superconducting (SC) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) phases. We show that, in a large-$N$ limit and with the bulk tuned to criticality, boundaries of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model display logarithmically decaying, or ``extraordinary-log,'' correlations. In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$. In the context of the QSH -- SC transition, the quantum critical point inherits helical edge modes from the QSH phase, and this extraordinary-log behavior manifests in their Cooper pair correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to non-abelian Hodge theory and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on compact Riemann surfaces. We develop the moduli theory of vector bundles and Higgs bundles, establish the main correspondences of non-abelian Hodge theory, and interpret them through the hyperk\"ahler structure on the Hitchin moduli space. We study the Hitchin fibration and its geometric properties, including SYZ mirror symmetry and topological mirror symmetry for type $\mathsf{A}$ Hitchin systems. As an illustration, we compute the Poincar\'e polynomial of the rank 2 moduli space and verify topological mirror symmetry in this case.</description>

      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Behavior of the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08222v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Bifurcated Impact of Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversion on Core-collapse Supernovae Informed by Multi-angle Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Kaluza-Klein Reduction of Einstein's Gravity in $6D$ on $S^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory with spacetime topology $M_4 \times S^2$ and analyze the gauge sector arising from dimensional reduction. Using normalized Killing vectors on $S^2$, we explicitly construct the reduced Yang-Mills action and determine the corresponding gauge kinetic matrix. Despite the $SO(3)$ isometry of $S^2$, we show that only two physical gauge fields propagate in four dimensions. The gauge kinetic matrix therefore has rank two and possesses a single zero eigenvalue. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the coset structure $S^2 \simeq SO(3)/SO(2)$ and reflects a non-dynamical gauge direction rather than an inconsistency of the reduction. Our results clarify the geometric origin of gauge degrees of freedom in Kaluza-Klein reductions on coset spaces.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.</description>

Abstract: We construct a novel exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell equations describing a dynamical black hole immersed in an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field. Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Tensor Power Spectrum from a Non-Minimally Coupled Spectator Field during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.</description>

      <title>QCD phase-transition under the light of Thermofractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\beta$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\langle L \rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\sigma^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\langle L \rangle \propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \langle L \rangle \propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the metric which describes the spacetime corresponding to the Frolov black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings and discuss how this cloud affects the regularity of the solution and the energy conditions. In addition, we analyze geodesics, effective potential, and several thermodynamic aspects. Finally, we compare our results with the corresponding findings in the literature for the original Frolov black hole, that is, in the absence of a cloud of strings</description>

      <title>Differential observables for the Higgs-strahlung process to all orders in EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop methods to obtain the fully differential cross-section for the $f \bar{f} \to Z(\ell\ell)\,h$ process to any desired order in effective field theory (EFT). To achieve this, we first derive a mapping between the partial wave expansion and the EFT expansion to all orders. We find that at lower orders, EFT predicts correlations between the different partial wave coefficients. This allows us to construct linear combinations of partial wave coefficients that get their leading contributions from a higher dimension EFT operator. We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process. While we take the Higgs-strahlung process as an example, the methods developed here are completely general and can be applied to other 2-to-2 collider processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that, with some care, dislocations could be meaningfully described by torsion, we propose here a scenario based on a previously unexplored role of time in the low-energy Dirac field theory description of two-space-dimensional Dirac materials. Our approach is based on the realization of an exotic time-loop that could be realized by oscillating particle-hole pairs, overcoming the well-known geometrical obstructions due to the lack of a third spatial dimension. General symmetry considerations allow concluding that the effects we are looking for can only be seen if we move to the nonlinear response regime.</description>

Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct the metric and its arbitrary-order derivatives at the horizon for any static, planar-symmetric black hole, using an infinite set of discrete pole-skipping points in momentum space where the boundary Green's function becomes ambiguous. This method is fully analytical and involves solving only linear equations. The near-horizon reconstruction can extend either inside or outside the horizon until reaching the nearest singularity in the complex radial plane. It further enables a reinterpretation of any pure gravitational field equation in pole-skipping data. Moreover, our method reveals that the pole-skipping points are redundant: only a subset is independent, while the rest are fixed by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial constraints. These identities are universal, independent of the details of the bulk geometry, including its dimensionality, asymptotic behavior, or the existence of a holographic duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble.
  Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

Abstract: We investigate trace formulas in $\varepsilon$-deformed W-algebras, highlighting a novel connection to the modular double of $\mathfrak{q}$-deformed W-algebras. In particular, we show that torus correlators in the additive (Yangian) setting reproduce sphere correlators in the trigonometric setup, possibly with the inclusion of a non-perturbative completion. From a dual perspective, this mechanism implements a gauge theoretic 2d$\to$3d uplift, where a circle direction in the world-sheet transmutes to a compact space-time direction in a non-trivial manner. We further discuss a unified picture of deformed W-algebras driven by trace formulas, suggesting a deeper algebraic layer related to the massive and massless form-factor approach to integrable QFT and 2d CFT.</description>

Abstract: In this article I consider type II superstring in the pure spinor formulation with constant background fields in the context of T-dualization. First I prove that bosonic and fermionic T-dualization commute using already known T-dual transformation laws for bosonic and fermionic T-dualization. Consequently, the T-dual transformation laws of the full T-dualization are obtained. At the end the full T-dualization is realized in double space and it is showed that Buscher procedure and double space approach are equivalent in this specific case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the cancellation of the ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ in the calculation of the expectation value of the five-dimensional (5D) energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ ($M,N=0,1,\cdots,4$). Since 5D fields feel the background geometry differently depending on their spins, the bosonic and the fermionic contributions to the $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$-dependent part $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ may have different profiles in the extra dimension. In that case, there is no chance for them to be cancelled with each other. We consider arbitrary numbers of scalar and spinor fields with arbitrary bulk masses, calculate $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ using the 5D propagators, and clarify the dependence of $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ on the extra-dimensional coordinate $y$ for a general background geometry of the extra dimension. We find that if the geometry is not flat nor (a slice of) anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, it is impossible to cancel $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ between the bosonic and the fermionic contributions. This may suggest that the flat (or AdS) space is energetically favored over the other geometries, and thus the dynamics forces the compact space to be flat (or AdS).</description>

Abstract: We explore 3d $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ theories arising from twisted compactification of 4d $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ $ (G, G') $ Argyres-Douglas superconformal field theories (SCFTs), together with the 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs) supported on the holomorphic boundary of their topologically twisted sector. Starting from the Coulomb branch BPS spectra of the $ (G,G') $ Argyres-Douglas theories, we develop a systematic and efficient method to obtain the ellipsoid partition functions of associated 3d theories using quiver mutations and wall-crossing invariants. This allows us to extract the modular data of the boundary VOAs, which are related to the Schur sectors of the 4d theories through the 4d SCFT/2d VOA correspondence. Our results provide a useful computational bridge between 4d SCFTs and 2d VOAs through interpolating 3d topological field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of modular flow on correlation functions of fermions in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled weakly to a bath, which we take to be another SYK model. The system and bath, together are prepared in the thermofield double (TFD) state, and we focus on the effect of modular flow generated by the reduced density matrix for the SYK system, obtained by tracing out the bath. We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities. Beyond a critical value of the modular parameter, the ``modular scrambling time", the singularity structure shows correlations being transferred from one boundary to the other. The calculations are performed by employing the replica trick in Euclidean time and appropriately analytically continuing to real time. Exploiting the connection between modular flow generators and SL$(2,{\mathbb R})$ boosts we use the microscopic picture to reconstruct the dual bulk modular flow in two-sided AdS$_2$ black hole spacetime. Fixed points of the flow allow to identify quantum extremal surfaces (QES) demarcating the entanglement wedge of the boundary system and the island. We show that bulk modular flow can move fermion insertions near the right boundary past the horizon leading to lightcone singularities in appropriately smeared boundary correlators, probing physics beyond the horizon.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pulsar timings are sensitive to both the nanohertz gravitational-wave background and the oscillation of ultralight dark matter. The Hellings-Downs angular correlation curve provides a criterion to search for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds at nanohertz via pulsar timing arrays. We study the angular correlation of the timing residuals induced by the spin-2 ultralight dark matter, which is different from the usual Hellings-Downs correlation. At a typical frequency, we show that the spin-2 ultralight dark matter can give rise to the deformation of the Hellings-Downs correlation curve induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons, which differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalence principle are realised in Weyl transverse gravity (and its generalisations). The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using CamSpec, HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of the Thermofield-Double Interpretation of the Minkowski Vacuumment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski vacuum is often presented in textbooks and reviews as a thermofield double (TFD) state, an entangled state of field modes in the left and right Rindler wedges. This picture is widely used to explain the Unruh effect, motivate entanglement entropy calculations, and connect quantum field theory to black hole thermodynamics and AdS/CFT. However, we show that this interpretation, while elegant, is not exact.
  We explicitly compute two-point functions and their derivatives for a massless scalar field in two-dimensional Minkowski space, comparing results obtained from canonical quantization with those obtained by assuming a TFD form of the vacuum. Mixed-derivative correlators agree perfectly, but higher-derivative correlators show systematic mismatches that persist even for points well away from horizons and are not removed by infrared regularization.
  To further test this picture, we construct an alternate coordinate system that divides Minkowski spacetime into two disconnected regions, apply the same derivation that leads to the standard TFD expression, and obtain a new "entangled-state" representation of the vacuum that is not thermal. This demonstrates that the appearance of a TFD structure is a feature of the derivation method rather than a fundamental property of the vacuum. Our results clarify the limits of interpreting the Minkowski vacuum as a literal TFD state, emphasizing that while it captures key thermal features, it should be viewed as a powerful calculational tool rather than a precise statement about Hilbert space structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the coefficients $c_2(T,B)$ and $c_4(T,B)$ of the Taylor expansion for the pressure in powers of $\mu_B/T$ in the presence of a large magnetic field within perturbative QCD at finite temperature and baryon density up to two-loops for $N_f=3$ flavors with physical quark masses. We also present results for the excess of pressure, baryon density and baryon number susceptibility as functions of $\mu_B$, as well as susceptibilities as functions of the temperature in the $\{ \mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S \}$ basis. Our results can be directly compared to recent lattice QCD data. Even though current lattice results do not overlap with its region of validity, perturbative results seem to be compatible with those obtained on the lattice for large temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.</description>

      <title>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.</description>

      <title>Higher curvature corrections to the black hole Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the annihilation to nothing scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, incorporating higher curvature corrections. By taking these corrections into account, we show that singularity resolution does not occur within low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of strong Charge-Parity violation and Peccei-Quinn mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) admits a topological \(\bar\theta\)-term that violates Charge-Parity \((CP)\) symmetry, yet experimental indicate that \(\bar\theta\) is nearly zero. To investigate this discrepancy in a controlled setting, we derive the Hamiltonian representation of the QCD Lagrangian and construct its \((1{+}1)\)-dimensional Schwinger-model analogue. By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are evaluated using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy \(E_0(\bar\theta)\) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a vacuum at \(\bar\theta = 0\ (\text{mod 2})\) in agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward a \(\theta_{\rm eff}=0\), thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation of Freely Falling Atoms: Nonlinear Electrodynamic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Rotationally invariant dynamical lattice regulators for Euclidean quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamical lattice regulator for Euclidean quantum field theories on a fixed hypercubic graph $\Lambda\simeq\mathbb{Z}^d$, in which the embedding $x:\Lambda\to\mathbb{R}^d$ is promoted to a dynamical field and integrated over subject to shape regularity constraints. The total action is local on $\Lambda$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global special Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations. Our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.
  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge and matter fields $(U,\Phi)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $\Lambda$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations. For example, in d=4 we recover the standard one-loop $\beta$-function in a scalar $\phi^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report d=2 proof-of-concept simulations showing a well behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artefacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>
