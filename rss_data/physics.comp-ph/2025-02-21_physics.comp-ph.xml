      <title>Enhancing nuclear cross-section predictions with deep learning: the DINo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of nuclear reaction cross-sections is crucial for applications such as hadron therapy, radiation protection, and nuclear reactor design. Despite continuous advancements in nuclear physics, significant discrepancies persist between experimental data and theoretical models such as TENDL, and ENDF/B. These deviations introduce uncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations widely used in nuclear physics and medical applications. In this work, DINo (Deep learning Intelligence for Nuclear reactiOns) is introduced as a deep learning-based algorithm designed to improve cross-section predictions by learning correlations between charge-changing and total cross-sections. Trained on the TENDL-2021 dataset and validated against experimental data from the EXFOR database, DINo demonstrates a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over conventional nuclear models. The results show that DINo systematically achieves lower chi2 values compared to TENDL-2021 across multiple isotopes, particularly for proton-induced reactions on a 12C target. Specifically, for 11C production, DINo reduces the discrepancy with experimental data by \sim 28\% compared to TENDL-2021. Additionally, DINo provides improved predictions for other relevant isotopes produced, such as 4He, 6Li, 9Be, and 10B, which play a crucial role in modeling nuclear fragmentation processes. By leveraging neural networks, DINo offers fast cross-section predictions, making it a promising complementary tool for nuclear reaction modeling. However, the algorithm's performance evaluation is sensitive to the availability of experimental data, with increased uncertainty in sparsely measured energy ranges. Future work will focus on refining the model through data augmentation, expanding its applicability to other reaction channels, and integrating it into Monte Carlo transport codes for real-time nuclear data processing.</description>

      <title>High-level, high-resolution ocean modeling at all scales with Oceananigans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the vision, user interface, governing equations, and numerical methods that underpin new ocean modeling software called ``Oceananigans''. Oceananigans is being developed by the Climate Modeling Alliance as part of a larger project to build a trainable climate model with quantifiable uncertainty. We argue that Oceananigans status as a popular, capable modeling system realizes a vision for accelerating progress in Earth system modeling that balances demands for model accuracy and performance, needed for state-of-the-art science, against accessibility, which is needed to accelerate development. This vision combines three cooperative elements: (i) a relatively simple finite volume algorithm (ii) optimized for high-resolution simulations on GPUs which is (iii) exposed behind an expressive, high-level user interface (using the Julia programming language in our case). We offer evidence for the vision's potential by illustrating the creative potential of our user interface, showcasing Oceananigans physics with example simulations that range from simple classroom problems to a realistic global ocean simulation spanning all scales of oceanic fluid motion, and describing advances in parameterization, numerical methods, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>An efficient and accurate semi-implicit time integration scheme for dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of numerical integrator in approximating solutions to dynamic partial differential equations depends on the smallest time-scale of the problem at hand. Large-scale deformations in elastic solids contain both shear waves and bulk waves, the latter of which can travel infinitely fast in incompressible materials. Explicit schemes, which are favored for their efficiency in resolving low-speed dynamics, are bound by time step size restrictions that inversely scale with the fastest wave speed. Implicit schemes can enable larger time step sizes regardless of the wave speeds present, though they are much more computationally expensive. Semi-implicit methods, which are more stable than explicit methods and more efficient than implicit methods, are emerging in the literature, though their applicability to nonlinear elasticity is not extensively studied. In this research, we develop and investigate the functionality of two time integration schemes for the resolution of large-scale dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids: a Modified Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula integrator (MSBDF2) and a forward Euler / Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula Runge-Kutta integrator (FEBDF2). We prove and empirically verify second order accuracy for both schemes. The stability properties of both methods are derived and numerically verified. We find FEBDF2 has a maximum time step size that inversely scales with the shear wave speed and is unaffected by the bulk wave speed -- the desired stability property of a semi-implicit scheme. Finally, we empirically determine that semi-implicit schemes struggle to preserve volume globally when using nonlinear incompressibility conditions, even under temporal and spatial refinement.</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>Lattice distortion tuning resistivity invar effect in high entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.</description>

      <title>Explicit adaptive time stepping for the Cahn-Hilliard equation by exponential Krylov subspace and Chebyshev polynomial methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation has been widely employed within various mathematical models in physics, chemistry and engineering. Explicit stabilized time stepping methods can be attractive for time integration of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, especially on parallel and hybrid supercomputers. In this paper, we propose an exponential time integration method for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and describe its efficient Krylov subspace based implementation. We compare the method to a Chebyshev polynomial local iteration modified (LIM) time stepping scheme. Both methods are explicit (i.e., do not involve linear system solution) and tested with both constant and adaptively chosen time steps.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator-Based Emulator for Regional Shallow Water Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. Although MITONet is applicable to a wide range of problems, we showcase its capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, while incorporating initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a varying domain parameter. We demonstrate MITONet's performance in a real-world application, highlighting its ability to make accurate predictions by extrapolating both in time and parametric space.</description>

      <title>Extending the RANGE of Graph Neural Networks: Relaying Attention Nodes for Global Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are routinely used in molecular physics, social sciences, and economics to model many-body interactions in graph-like systems. However, GNNs are inherently local and can suffer from information flow bottlenecks. This is particularly problematic when modeling large molecular systems, where dispersion forces and local electric field variations drive collective structural changes. Existing solutions face challenges related to computational cost and scalability. We introduce RANGE, a model-agnostic framework that employs an attention-based aggregation-broadcast mechanism that significantly reduces oversquashing effects, and achieves remarkable accuracy in capturing long-range interactions at a negligible computational cost. Notably, RANGE is the first virtual-node message-passing implementation to integrate attention with positional encodings and regularization to dynamically expand virtual representations. This work lays the foundation for next-generation of machine-learned force fields, offering accurate and efficient modeling of long-range interactions for simulating large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Compact quantum algorithms for time-dependent differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Frequency Sampling for Data-driven Model Order Reduction Applied to Antenna Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, which are essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework, where the proposed algorithms reach the smallest errors for the smallest number of frequency points chosen.</description>

      <title>Undamped Soliton-like Domain Wall Motion in Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer van der Waals materials exhibits ultrafast switching speed and fatigue resistance during the polarization switching, offering an avenue for the design of memories and neuromorphic devices. The unique polarization switching behavior originates from the distinct characteristics of domain wall (DW), which possesses broader width and faster motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we predict an undamped soliton-like DW motion in sliding ferroelectrics. It is found that the DW in sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, with its velocity ultimately reaches the relativistic-like limit due to continuous acceleration. Remarkably, the DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. This work provides opportunities for applications of sliding ferroelectrics in memory devices based on DW engineering.</description>
