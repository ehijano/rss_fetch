      <title>Impact of bunch intensity asymmetry in colliders featuring strong beamstrahlung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical investigation of beamstrahlung-induced blow-up in Gaussian beams with arbitrary dimensions is presented, using various approximations for the strength of the hourglass effect and crab waist scheme. The results, applied to the FCC-ee resonances, are compared with simulations and previous calculations, and relative luminosity values are also calculated. The stability of resultant conformations are analysed to rule out the existence of a flip-flop phenomenon in the longitudinal plane analogous to the well-known transverse counterpart. Implications for the top-up injection procedures are discussed, and a phenomenological model is proposed to study the transverse-longitudinal coupling in the blowup dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stable Acceleration of a LHe-Free Nb3Sn demo SRF e-linac Based on Conduction Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design, construction, and commissioning of a conduction-cooled Nb3Sn demonstration superconducting radio frequency (SRF) electron accelerator at the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMP, CAS) will be presented. In the context of engineering application planning for Nb3Sn thin-film SRF cavities within the CiADS project, a 650MHz 5-cell elliptical cavity was coated using the vapor diffusion method for electron beam acceleration. Through high-precision collaborative control of 10 GM cryocooler, slow cooldown of the cavity crossing 18K is achieved accompanied by obviously characteristic magnetic flux expulsion. The horizontal test results of the liquid helium-free (LHe-free) cryomodule show that the cavity can operate steadily at Epk=6.02MV/m in continuous wave (CW) mode, and at Epk=14.90MV/m in 40% duty cycle pulse mode. The beam acceleration experiment indicates that the maximum average current of the electron beam in the macropulse after acceleration exceeds 200mA, with a maximum energy gain of 4.6MeV. The results provide a principle validation for the engineering application of Nb3Sn thin-film SRF cavities, highlighting the promising industrial application prospects of a small-scale compact Nb3Sn SRF accelerator driven by commercial cryocoolers.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation of MeV Energy X-ray Sources for use in the Inspection of Additively Manufactured Parts for Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we demonstrate the application of an inverse Compton scattering X-ray Source, driven by a laser-plasma accelerator, to image an additively manufactured component. X-rays with a mean energy of 380 keV were produced and used to image an additively manufactured part made of an Inconel (Nickel 718) alloy. Because inverse Compton scattering driven by laser-plasma acceleration produces high-energy X-rays while maintaining a focal spot size on the order of a micron, the source can provide several benefits over conventional X-ray production methods, particularly when imaging superalloy parts, with the potential to revolutionise what can be inspected.</description>

      <title>Coupled Axial and Transverse Currents Method for Finite Element Modelling of Periodic Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Coupled Axial and Transverse currents (I) (CATI) method, as an efficient and accurate finite element approach for modelling the electric and magnetic behavior of periodic composite superconducting conductors. The method consists of a pair of two-dimensional models coupled via circuit equations to account for the conductor geometrical periodicity. This allows to capture three-dimensional effects with two-dimensional models and leads to a significant reduction in computational time compared to conventional three-dimensional models. After presenting the method in detail, we verify it by comparison with reference finite element models, focussing on its application to twisted multifilamentary superconducting strands. In particular, we show that the \method method captures the transition from uncoupled to coupled filaments, with accurate calculation of the interfilament coupling time constant. We then illustrate the capabilities of the method by generating a detailed loss map and magnetization curves of given strand types for a range of external transverse magnetic field excitations, with and without transport current.</description>

      <title>Muon Ring and FCC-ee / CEPC Based Antimuon-Electron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>

      <title>Transmission of vortex electrons through a solenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that it is generally nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states (NSLG) rather than the Landau ones that appropriately describe electrons with orbital angular momentum both in their dynamics at a hard-edge boundary between a solenoid and vacuum and inside the magnetic field. It is shown that the r.m.s. radius of the NSLG state oscillates in time and its period-averaged value can significantly exceed the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state, even far from the boundary. We propose to study the unconventional features of quantum dynamics inside a solenoid in several experimental scenarios with vortex electrons described by the NSLG states. Relevance for processes in scanning and transmission electron microscopes, as well as for particle accelerators with relativistic beams is emphasized.</description>
