      <title>Log-free estimate for the resonant paraproduct in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the resonant paraproduct (high-high $\to$ low regime) in the nonlinearity $(u\cdot\nabla)u$ for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. For sufficiently smooth, divergence-free u, we establish the a priori estimate without logarithmic loss $$\|R_N(u)\|{\dot H^{-1}} \lesssim N^{-1}\,\|u\|{\dot H^{1/2}}\,\|u\|_{\dot H^{1}},$$ with a constant independent of the dyadic frequency $N$. The proof combines phase-geometric integration by parts along an adapted frame, wave-packet discretization at scale $N^{-1/2}$, and an anisotropic Strichartz estimate on time windows of length $N^{-1/2}$. In the wide angular region we apply bilinear decoupling on a rank-3 phase surface; in the geometry at hand the minimal curvature yields a gain of order $N^{-1/6+o(1)}$ (with $o(1)\to 0$ as $N\to\infty$), which suffices to remove the logarithmic loss. The contribution from the narrow region is handled separately by an energy argument in $\dot H^{-1}$ using null-form suppression near the interaction diagonal. The resulting bound is scale-consistent and requires no smallness assumptions, only the divergence-free condition on $u$. The analysis is restricted to a single resonant component of the paraproduct; potential extensions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Regularity theory for mixed local-nonlocal problem involving general stable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the regularity of solutions to a linear elliptic equation involving a mixed local-nonlocal operator of the form $$Lu - \operatorname{div}\big(a(x)\nabla u(x)\big)= f, \quad \text{in } \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n,$$ where $L$ is a general stable L\'{e}vy type operator and $a(\cdot)$ is a positive H\"{o}lder continuous weight. By establishing a maximum principle and a Liouville-type result in the entire space, we are able to derive the interior regularity and the regularity up to the boundary of the solutions under suitable assumptions on $f(x)$ and $a(x)$ .</description>

      <title>On a new region for the Lane-Emden conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lane-Emden conjecture, which asserts the non-existence of non-trivial, non-negative solutions to the Lane-Emden system
  \[
  -\Delta u = v^p, \quad -\Delta v = u^q, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^n\]
  in the subcritical regime. By employing an Obata-type integral inequality, Picone's identity, and exploiting the scaling invariance of the system, we prove that the conjecture holds for any dimension $n \geq 5$ and exponents satisfying $p\geq 1,q\geq 1$, and
  \[
  \frac{1}{p+1} + \frac{1}{q+1} \geq 1 - \frac{2}{n} + \frac{4}{n^2}.

      <title>Global weak solutions to nonlinear kinetic Fokker--Planck equations in bounded domains under physical initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak solutions to a nonlinear kinetic Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate diffusion, under either inflow or partial absorption-reflection boundary conditions. The novelty of our approach lies in constructing solutions under solely the physical assumptions on the initial and boundary data, namely finite mass, kinetic energy, and entropy, with no additional regularity imposed. To overcome the lack of uniform ellipticity, we develop a new compactness principle based on weighted Fisher information, which yields strong $L^1$ convergence of approximate solutions. This framework provides a robust existence theory under only the physically relevant conditions, and applies uniformly to both inflow and reflection boundary settings.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of viscous boundary layers in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that shear flows are linearly unstable provided the viscosity is small enough, when the horizontal Fourier wave number lies in some interval, between the so-called lower and upper marginally stable curves. In this article, we prove that, under a natural spectral assumption, shear flows undergo a Hopf bifurcation near their upper marginally stable curve. In particular, close to this curve, there exists space periodic traveling waves solutions of the full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. For the linearized operator, the occurrence of an essential spectrum containing the entire negative real axis causes certain difficulties which are overcome. Moreover, if this Hopf bifurcation is super-critical, these time and space periodic solutions are linearly and nonlinearly asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Accelerated and fast magnetic reconnection through enhanced resistive dissipation for MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection, namely a change in the topology of magnetic lines, for sufficiently regular solutions of the three-dimensional periodic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We provide examples where magnetic reconnection occurs on time scales shorter than the resistive one, due to enhanced dissipation emerging from advective effects. This is the first analytical result where the advection term plays an active role in the reconnection process. A key aspect of our approach is a new estimate for enhanced diffusion of high Sobolev norms, which is of independent interest beyond its application to the MHD equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth, closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ equipped with a linear connection $\nabla$ (not necessarily metric), we develop the holomorphic functional calculus for operators belonging to the global pseudo-differential classes $\Psi_{\rho, \delta}^m\left(\Omega^\kappa, \nabla, \tau\right)$ introduced by Safarov. As a consequence of our main result, we establish a Szeg\"o type-theorem, derive asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel trace, and calculate some associated spectral $\zeta$-functions.</description>

In particular, we show that space-time weights $|(x,t)|^{-\alpha}$ admit stronger singularities and require weaker regularity assumptions on the initial data compared to purely spatial weights $|x|^{-\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06979v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When mean curvature flow evolves non-uniquely, the flow is said to fatten. The work of Ilmanen shows that any weak MCF is supported inside the fattening, and work of Hershkovits--White identified canonical weak flows supported on the boundary of the fattening, known as the outermost flows. It is natural to ask, when the flow fattens, are there weak mean curvature flows supported strictly inside the fattening? Outside of some special cases (e.g. flow from cones), this question was entirely open. We show these interior flows exist, providing a general construction for non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the parabolic $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn. This gives the first examples of closed, non-trivial, non-canonical, integral Brakke motions. As part of this construction, we study the $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn flow from low regularity initial data, and our results demonstrate the existence of integral Brakke motions from fractal sets. This includes the existence portion of Hershkovits's work on mean curvature flow from Reifenberg sets.</description>

  with an emphasis on the non-convex case, and the difficulties it involves to prevent the Lavrentiev phenomenon. We determine a formulation of the lower semicontinuous envelope of $E[f]$ with respect to various topologies and with fixed Lipschitz Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability of non-conservative cross diffusion model and approximation by stochastic particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of non-conservative deterministic cross diffusion models and prove that they are approximated by stochastic population models when the populations become locally large. In this model, the individuals of two species move, reproduce and die with rates sensitive to the local densities of the two species. Quantitative estimates are given and convergence is obtained soon as the population per site and the number of sites go to infinity. The proofs rely on the extension of stability estimates via duality approach under a smallness condition and the development of large deviation estimates for structured population models, which are of independent interest. The proofs also involve martingale estimates in H^{-1} and improve the approximation results in the conservative case as well.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation with nonlinear mobility via chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation based on an interpretation as a chemical reaction network. We consider the rate equation on the discretized circle for a process in which pairs of particles occupying the same site simultaneously jump to the two neighboring sites; the reverse process involves pairs of particles at adjacent sites simultaneously jumping back to the site located between them. Depending on the rates, in the vanishing-mesh-size limit we obtain either the classical DLSS equation or a variant with nonlinear mobility of power type. Via EDP convergence, we identify the limiting gradient structure to be driven by entropy with respect to a generalization of diffusive transport with nonlinear mobility. Interestingly, the DLSS equation with power-type mobility shares qualitative similarities with the fast diffusion and porous medium equation, since we find traveling wave solutions with algebraic tails or compactly supported polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on systems of strongly coupled elliptic operators whose coefficients may be unbounded and are defined on a domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. It is shown that a quasi-contractive semigroup in $L^p$-spaces can be associated with such operators for values of $p$ belonging to an interval that contains $2$ as an interior point. Then, under refined assumptions and considering systems of elliptic operators coupled up to first order, new kernel estimates are established with respect to a distance function that accounts for the growth of the diffusion coefficients and the potential term at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(N,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with negative curvature of dimension $n\geq 3$. This paper investigates the prescribed curvature problem defined by the $p$-fold sum of the modified Shouten tensor for $1\leq p\leq n$. As an application, we establish the existence of a metric $\tilde{g}$ conformal to $g$ such that \[ \mathcal{M}_{p}(\mathrm{Ric}_{\tilde{g}})=constant. \] In the case $p=1$, this resolves a well-known result of Gursky and Viaclovsky [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 52 (2003), no. 2, 399--419 MR1976082].</description>

      <title>Quantitative boundary H\"{o}lder estimates for the inhomogeneous Poisson problem through a probabilistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive quantitative boundary H\"older estimates, with explicit constants, for the inhomogeneous Poisson problem in a bounded open set $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
  Our approach has two main steps: firstly, we consider an arbitrary $D$ as above and prove that the boundary $\alpha$-H\"older regularity of the solution the Poisson equation is controlled, with explicit constants, by the H\"older seminorm of the boundary data, the $L^ \gamma$-norm of the forcing term with $\gamma&gt;d/2$, and the $\alpha/2$-moment of the exit time from $D$ of the Brownian motion.
  Secondly, we derive explicit estimates for the $\alpha/2$-moment of the exit time in terms of the distance to the boundary, the regularity of the domain $D$, and $\alpha$. Using this approach, we derive explicit estimates for the same problem in domains satisfying exterior ball conditions, respectively exterior cone/wedge conditions, in terms of simple geometric features.
  As a consequence we also obtain explicit constants for pointwise estimates for the Green function and for the gradient of the solution.
  The obtained estimates can be employed to bypass the curse of high dimensions when aiming to approximate the solution of the Poisson problem using neural networks, obtaining polynomial scaling with dimension, which in some cases can be shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a class of semilinear Moore-Gibson-Thompson equations with subcritical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of higher-order semilinear evolution equations inspired by the Moore-Gibson-Thompson model introduced by Dell'Oro, Liverani and Pata (2023), involving strongly elliptic operators of order ($2m$) with homogeneous boundary conditions. The associated unbounded linear operator is a sectorial operator with zero belonging to the resolvent set, allowing the construction of fractional powers spaces, and the analysis of their spectral properties. We prove the local well-posedness of the corresponding semilinear Cauchy problem under subcritical nonlinearities. Our framework clarifies the role of extrapolation spaces and fractional domains in handling the lack of accretivity and bounded imaginary powers of the operator.</description>

      <title>Global solvability of the Laplace equation in weighted Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-local boundary value problem for the Laplace equation in unbounded studding the weak and strong solvability of that problem in the framework of the weighted Sobolev space $W^{1,p}_\nu$, with a Muckenhoupt weight. We proved that if any weak solution belongs to the space $W_{\nu}^{2,p}$, then it is also a strong solution and satisfies the corespding boundary conditions. It should be noted that such problems do not fit into the general theory of elliptic equations and require a special technique.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations on the whole space including the two-dimensional case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us consider the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with the time-periodic external forces in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 2$ and investigate the existence and non-existence of time-periodic solutions. In the higher dimensional case $n \geq 3$, we construct a unique small solution for given small time-periodic force in the scaling critical spaces of Besov type and prove its stability under small perturbations. In contrast, for the two-dimensional case $n=2$, the time-periodic solvability of the Navier--Stokes equations has been long standing open. It is the central work of this paper that we have now succeeded in solving this issue negatively by providing examples of small external forces such that each of them does not generate time-periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Linearization in incompatible elasticity for general ambient spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we unveil novel monotonicity conditions applicable for Mean Field Games through the exploration of finite dimensional $canonical\ transformations$. Our findings contribute to establishing new global well-posedness results for the associated master equations, also in the case of potentially degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Additionally, we show that recent advancements in global well-posedness results, specifically those related to displacement semi-monotone and anti-monotone data, can be easily obtained as a consequence of our main results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the study of a two-phase problem equipped with the $\Phi$-Laplacian operator

  $\Phi(s)=e^{s^2}-1$ and $\phi=\Phi'$. We obtain the existence, boundedness, and Log-Lipschitz regularity of the minimizers of the energy functional associated to the two-phase problem. Furthermore, we also prove that the phase change free boundaries of the minimizers possess a finite perimeter.</description>

      <title>A phase field model of Cahn-Hilliard type for tumour growth with mechanical effects and damage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new diffuse interface model for tumour growth in the presence of a nutrient, in which we take into account mechanical effects and reversible tissue damage. The highly nonlinear PDEs system mainly consists of a Cahn-Hilliard type equation that describes the phase separation process between healthy and tumour tissue coupled to a parabolic reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient and a hyperbolic equation for the balance of forces, including inertial and viscous effects. The main novelty of this work is the introduction of cellular damage, whose evolution is ruled by a parabolic differential inclusion. In this paper, we prove a global-in-time existence result for weak solutions by passing to the limit in a time-discretised and regularised version of the system.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions to the compressible Navier--Stokes--Coriolis system for large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Navier--Stokes system with the Coriolis force on the $3$D whole space. In this model, the Coriolis force causes the linearized solution to behave like a $4$th order dissipative semigroup $\{ e^{-t\Delta^2} \}_{t&gt;0}$ with slower time decay rates than the heat kernel, which creates difficulties in nonlinear estimates in the low-frequency part and prevents us from constructing the global strong solutions by following the classical method. On account of this circumstance, the existence of unique global strong solutions has been open even in the classical Matsumura--Nishida framework. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned difficulties and succeed in constructing a unique global strong solution in the framework of scaling critical Besov spaces. Furthermore, our result also shows that the global solution is constructed for arbitrarily large initial data provided that the speed of the rotation is high and the Mach number is low enough by focusing on the dispersive effect due to the mixture of the Coriolis force and acoustic wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-established that shear flows in a periodic strip are linearly unstable for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations provided the viscosity is small enough. In this article, under a natural spectral assumption which is satisfied for convex or concave analytic flows, we prove that shear flows undergo a Hopf bifurcation near their upper marginal stability curve. In particular, near this curve, there exist solutions which are periodic in $t$ and $x$.</description>

Precisely, for nonlinearity powers slightly smaller than the $L^2$-critical exponent, we prove that there always exists at least one value of the mass for which normalized ground states are not unique.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation in presence of a uniform and fixed gravity field, in the case of Maxwell molecules. We first obtain a well-posedness result in the space of finite, non-negative Radon measures. In addition, we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the external field. We further show that this stationary solution is unique in the class of the finite, non-negative Radon measures with finite first order moment, and that all the solutions in this class converge towards the stationary solution in the weak topology of the measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel energy method that reinterprets ``curve shortening'' as ``tangent aligning''. This conceptual shift enables the variational study of infinite-length curves evolving by the curve shortening flow, as well as higher order flows such as the elastic flow, which involves not only the curve shortening but also the curve straightening effect. For the curve shortening flow, we prove convergence to a straight line under mild assumptions on the ends of the initial curve. For the elastic flow, we establish a global well-posedness theory, and investigate the precise long-time behavior of solutions. In fact, our method applies to a more general class of geometric evolution equations including the surface diffusion flow, Chen's flow, and the free elastic flow.</description>

The data are Cara\-th\'e\-o\-dory functions, and the principal part is of $VMO_x$-type with respect to the variables $ (x,t).$ Assuming the existence of a strong solution $u_0,$ we apply the Implicit Function Theorem in a small domain of this solution to show that small bounded perturbations of the data, locally in time, lead to small perturbations of the solution $u_0$. Additionally, we apply the Newton Iteration Procedure to construct an approximating sequence converging to the solution $u_0$ in the corresponding Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Global Existence of Solutions for A Class of Nonlocal Reaction-Diffusion Systems and Their Diffusive Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the global existence of solutions for a class of semilinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems with $m$ components on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. The initial data is assumed to be component-wise nonnegative and bounded, and the reaction vector field associated with the system is assumed to be quasi-positive and satisfy a generalized mass control condition. We obtain global existence and uniqueness of component-wise nonnegative solutions. With the additional assumption that the reaction vector field satisfies a linear intermediate sums condition, we employ an $L^p$ energy type functional to establish the uniform boundedness of solutions in $L^p(\Omega)$ for all $2 \le p&lt;\infty$ independent of the nonlocal diffusion operator for our system in $L^p$ space for $2 \le p &lt; \infty$. This allows us to generalize a recent diffusive limit result of Laurencot and Walker \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal}. We, also analyze a class of $m$ component reaction-diffusion systems in which some of the components diffuse nonlocally and the other components diffuse locally, where the latter components satisfy homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under various assumptions, we establish global existence and uniqueness of componentwise nonnegative solutions by using duality arguments. Finally, we numerically verify our diffusive limit result. We also numerically solve the reaction-diffusion systems with a mixture of nonlocal and local diffusion and show the visual difference of its solutions with the system in which all components diffuse nonlocally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a CMC hypersurface with an isolated singular point at which the tangent cone is regular, and such that, in a neighbourhood of said point, the hypersurface is the boundary of a Caccioppoli set that minimises the standard prescribed-mean-curvature functional. We prove that in a ball centred at the singularity there exists a sequence of smooth CMC hypersurfaces, with the same prescribed mean curvature, that converge to the given one. Moreover, these hypersurfaces arise as boundaries of minimisers. In ambient dimension $8$ the condition on the cone is redundant. (When the mean curvature vanishes identically, the result is the well-known Hardt--Simon approximation theorem.)</description>

Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

Abstract: The statistical features of homogeneous, isotropic, two-dimensional stochastic turbulence are discussed. We derive some rigorous bounds for the mean value of the bulk energy dissipation rate $\mathbb{E} [\varepsilon ]$ and enstrophy dissipation rates $\mathbb{E} [\chi] $ for 2D flows sustained by a variety of stochastic driving forces. We show that $$\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon ] \rightarrow 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\mbox{and} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathbb{E} [ \chi ] \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$$ in the inviscid limit, consistent with the dual-cascade in 2D turbulence.</description>
