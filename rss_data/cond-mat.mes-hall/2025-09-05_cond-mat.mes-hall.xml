      <title>From Qubits to Qumodes: Information Capacity of Anyonic Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum statistics and information encoding is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Here, the maximum information capacity of a quantum state governed by Haldane's exclusion statistics is derived. The capacity, defined by the maximum von Neumann entropy of its occupancy distribution, follows S_max(g) = log2(\lfloor 1/g \rfloor + 1). This result continuously interpolates between the fermionic limit of a single qubit (g = 1) and the bosonic limit of a continuous-variable qumode (g -&gt; 0). For the nu = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall state (g = 1/3), we predict a 2-bit capacity, observable as four distinct quantized conductance plateaus in quantum dot spectroscopy, providing a direct signature of anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Exchange tensors, generalized RKKY interactions, and magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic (FM) layers interfaced with three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Integrating out the topological surface states and computing the spin determinant to second order in spins, we derive the effective generalized Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions mediated by topological surface states. These interactions inherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin susceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface electrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization texture in the FM layer induces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the spin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this problem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic properties, but a term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the rate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion dynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated interactions, including tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical potential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to finite temperatures. They elucidate topologically induced magnetic phenomena and pave the way for engineering exotic spin textures, such as skyrmions and chiral domain walls, in TI/FM hybrid systems with tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>Magic continuum in multi-moir\'e twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices provide a highly tunable platform for exploring the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology. Introducing a second moir\'e pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two moir\'e patterns produces a supermoir\'e modulation, opening a route to further tailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies such a system: two distinct moir\'e patterns arise from the relative twists between adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated phenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist angles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space. Depending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls into two classes: moir\'e polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with locally commensurate moir\'e order, and moir\'e quasicrystals, characterized by smoothly varying local moir\'e configurations. In helically twisted moir\'e polycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological bands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast, superconductivity appears generically in our moir\'e quasicrystals. A subset of these systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity, which we attribute to the supermoir\'e structure. Our findings uncover the organizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer graphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoir\'e modulation and lattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions arise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the multi-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states with an envelope wavefunction that has finite vorticity in momentum space, dictated by the topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin, which can have a net Chern number, and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, we find that topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of thermoelectric performance via engineered transmission functions in multi-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate strategies for harnessing quantum interference to optimize the figure of merit $ZT$, power output, and thermodynamic efficiency in multi-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) thermoelectric heat engines. Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism, we show that interference effects such as Fano-type asymmetries, Dicke-like superradiant and subradiant modes, and multi-peaked transmission spectra can be tailored through device geometry, magnetic flux, and dot-lead coupling to produce hybrid transmission profiles that combine Lorentzian, boxcar, and Fano lineshapes. Such engineered profiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp Lorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra, yielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot arrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an optimal regime, $t/\gamma \approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude $t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and efficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \sim 30$ at dilution temperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\%$ of Carnot efficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence between the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. Introducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency and power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases with the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at intermediate system sizes. These findings establish coherent control in multi-dot nanostructures as a promising pathway toward high-performance quantum thermoelectric heat engines for ultralow-power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Three-channel charge Kondo model at high transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum impurity models involving a localized charge that is weakly coupled to electronic leads usually map to Kondo-like Hamiltonians that exhibit various quantum critical behaviors. Here, we address the opposite regime of high contact transparency by solving the model of a quantum island coupled to three quantum Hall edge channels. Using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a nonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear conductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the zero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the three-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all transparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to the pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed points as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the interactions, changes. Our work demonstrates that FRG methods are an efficient tool for solving quantum impurity problems in regimes where standard approaches fail.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in a double isomeric Class-II oligo(indenoindene)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report the theoretical prediction of non-trivial physics in a one dimensional multiradical system consisting in fused six and five membered ${\pi}$-conjugated carbon rings, known as oligo(indenoindene) (OInIn). Topologically protected electronic states may emerge in fermionic chains if there is an alternation in the coupling of adjacent unpaired electrons, being described effectively by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Class-II OInIn isomers act as tight-binding chains in the non-interacting regime, thus we can expect the emergence of SSH physics in an OInIn produced by the combination of two isomers that belong to this class. That is the case of the system studied in this manuscript, whose calculated non-interacting band structure shows a gap opening compared to the gapless pure isomeric forms, hosting ingap localized states at the chain termini depending on the termination, and a non-zero Zak phase that confirms the non-trivial topology. These results were consistent with spin unrestricted mean-field Hubbard and density functional theory calculations, showing antiferromagnetic unquenched local magnetic moments at the pentagons, and strong edge localization depending on the termination. This work advances in the understanding of the physics of non-alternant multiradical ${\pi}$-conjugated hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rashba spin-orbit coupling in bulk gold with buried network of nanoscale interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashba effect, which plays a crucial role in fundamental materials physics and potential spintronics applications, has been engineered in diverse systems, including semiconductor quantum wells, oxide heterostructures, metallic surfaces, topological insulators, ferroelectrics, etc. However, generating it in systems that preserve bulk inversion symmetry (BIS), for example, in bulk metals, has not been possible so far. We demonstrate a unique strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids, by incorporating ultra-small silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allowed dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with a coupling strength of ~15 meV.Angstrom, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge-transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.</description>

      <title>A One-Particle Density Matrix Framework for Mode-Shell Correspondence: Characterizing Topology in Higher-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous limit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate double quantum dots defined by electrostatic gating in semiconductor PbTe nanowire devices. We perform transport measurements to obtain charge stability diagrams distinguished by negligible separation between paired triple points and by the spin degeneracy of all transport resonances at zero magnetic field. We show a fourfold splitting of high-bias stability diagram triangles in an applied magnetic field to illustrate the lifting of this spin degeneracy. We also identify patterns of narrow transport resonances in these high-bias triangles and discuss their possible physical origins. Our results represent a step towards the realization of PbTe-based spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted bilayer graphene that contains a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting one-dimensional electronic states. We calculate plasmon dispersion by solving classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon band structure is shown to be quasi-periodic in frequency and damped everywhere except at high-symmetry points of the moir\'e Brillouin zone. We compare our network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and discuss when each approach is valid. Calculations of plasmon waves launched by local scatterers are presented to simulate terahertz nano-imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitting Nernst Effect in Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a distinctive magnet phase, which has spin-split energy band but with zero net magnetic moment. In this paper, we propose that altermagnet behaves spin splitting Nernst effect: Under a longitudinal temperature gradient, the electrons with opposite spins tend to split oppositely in the transverse direction, thus generating a transverse spin current. The spin splitting Nernst effect is understood from the contribution of the longitudinal wave vector to the transverse group velocity. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we calculate the spin-dependent transmission coefficient in the four-terminal altermagnet device. From the spin-dependent transmission coefficient, the nonzero transverse spin current from longitudinal temperature gradient is obtained, and the spin splitting Nernst effect is verified. We systematically study the parameter dependence of the spin splitting Nernst effect, while also performing symmetry analysis. The spin splitting Nernst effect can be easily regulated by Fermi surface energy, temperature, transport direction, and system size. Furthermore, in altermagnet, the $xy$-response and $yx$-response spin splitting Nernst coefficients are equal with $N_{s,xy}=N_{s,yx}$, different from the conventional spin Nernst effect where they are opposite. Meanwhile, the spin splitting Nernst effect require neither spin-orbit coupling nor net magnetism.</description>

      <title>Atomic collapse of high-order singular potentials in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial atoms in graphene hosting a series of quasi-bound states can serve as an excellent platform to explore atomic collapse and become a basis to design novel graphene nanodevices. We theoretically study behaviors of massless Dirac fermions in singular potentials with a general form of 1/r^{\gamma}. Different from the Coulomb potential that demands a supercritical charge Z &gt; Zc, a high-order singular potential ({\gamma} &gt; 1) is found to in principle induce atomic collapse with an infinitesimal charge Z. The energies of atomic collapse states (ACSs) within these potentials are arranged roughly as a power sequence. We also show that some special ACSs can exist even above the bulk Dirac point, which cannot appear in the Coulomb potential. These findings uncover the anomalies of massless Dirac fermions in diverse charge potentials and provide guidance for further experiments and graphene nanodevice applications.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic superlattices: anisotropic band and spin-valley valve in buckled two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic superlattices (AFSL) are proposed based on the buckled hexagonal two-dimensional materials, which can be realized by the proximity effect of the periodically deposited antiferromagnets. It is found that the AF proximity effect can give rise to valley-polarized minibands and conductance, which are not held under ferromagnetic proximity. The spin degeneracy and valley degeneracy are lifted simultaneously in the presence of AF proximity and electric field. In consequence, both minibands and conductance could be spin-valley polarized completely in AFSL. The symmetry of spin-valley polarization is analysed by considering the pseudospin rotation operations and spatial inversion operations. Furthermore, AFSL also induce a highly anisotropic band structure due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular, the group velocity parallel to the periodic direction of AFSL is greatly renormalized, while the velocity perpendicular to the periodic direction remains unaffected, contrary to that observed in graphene superlattices. With the increase of SOC, the anisotropy becomes more prominent, leading to flattened band and electron supercollimation. The direction of anisotropy can be regulated by adjusting the potential and SOC. These findings offer an alternative approach to engineering anisotropic two-dimensional materials. As an application, the AFSL may well work as a symmetry-protected spin-valley valve easily controlled by the gate voltages.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected magnetoresistance by quantum anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, antiferromagnetic (AF) materials have attracted rapid attention, because they are considered as outstanding candidates to replace the widely used ferromagnets in the next generation of spintronics. We propose a magnetoresistance model based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect in an AF system, which is protected by the topological Chern number. By regulating the AF exchange field and an electric field, the system can be controlled between the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases and the quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) phases. As a result, a QAHI/QSHI/QAHI junction can be formed. In the QAHI region, the spin orientation of chiral edge state can be manipulated by tuning the AF exchange field and the electric field. Therefore, the spin directions of two QAHIs in the junction can have parallel and antiparallel configurations. The conductances of two configurations offered by chiral edge states are significantly different, and this is a magnetoresistance effect that can be electrically controlled. Because of the topological invariance, the magnetoresistance plateaus are robust to the size effect and the disorder.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in antiferromagnetic insulators: Crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Dirac semimetals with tunable edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a design for two-dimensional Dirac semimetals using a bilayer-modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. By introducing new sites into the BHZ model, we engineer flat bands at the Fermi energy. In the bilayer system, interlayer coupling separates these flat bands, resulting in two Dirac points that preserve time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Two Dirac points are connected by a one-dimensional Fermi arc edge state, whose bound nature is confirmed by quantized transmission resonance peaks. Notably, the position of the Dirac points can be precisely tuned by adjusting interlayer coupling strengths and symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy band structure and energy levels of graphene with staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields. Our study demonstrates that staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling induces bulk band crossover at the the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys and generates antihelical edge states at the zigzag boundaries, resulting in topological metallic phases. Quantized transport coefficients confirm the existence of these antihelical edge states. Furthermore, an in-plane Zeeman field, regardless of orientation, opens a gap in the antihelical edge states while preserving bulk band closure, leading to higher-order topological metals with corner states. We also validate the presence of these corner states in nanoflakes with zigzag boundaries and confirm the metallic phases with crossed bands through a continuum low-energy model analysis.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism-Induced Parity Anomaly in Weak Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that introducing altermagnetism on the surface of a weak topological insulator (TI) results in the emergence of a single massless Dirac fermion, exhibiting a parity anomaly. To explore the transport properties induced by this parity anomaly, we propose an effective two-dimensional (2D) lattice model to describe the weak TI surface. This model captures both the energy spectrum and spin texture of the weak TI surface while reducing computational complexity. We show that the weak TI surface hosts a half-integer chiral edge current under the influence of altermagnetism. Additionally, in the presence of decoherence, the Hall conductance attains a half-quantized value. Layer-resolved calculations from a 3D slab model further confirm that surface altermagnetism drives the surface Hall conductance to transition to $e^{2}/2h$, aligning with calculation from the 2D effective lattice model. Our findings establish a link between altermagnetism and quantum anomalies, positioning weak TIs as a potential platform for investigating the parity anomaly without a net magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Altermagnetic Order and Wilson Mass in the Dirac Equation: Helical Edge States without Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI) thin films interfaced with altermagnetic (AM) orders. Starting from a modified Dirac equation, we elucidate the interplay between the Wilson mass, arising from lattice regularization, and the altermagnetic mass, and show how this interplay fundamentally alters the band topology and boundary modes. In particular, we demonstrate that coupling a 3DTI thin film to AM order induces a topological phase transition: although the total Chern number remains zero across the transition, topological helical edge states emerge after the transition. These helical edge states arise from opposite Chern numbers at different high-symmetry points, and are distinct from both the chiral edge states of the quantum anomalous Hall phase and the helical edge states of the conventional quantum spin Hall states. The quantum transport simulations reveal robust, quantized nonlocal resistance plateaus associated with these helical edge states, which persist even under strong potential and magnetic disorder. Our results establish 3DTI/AM heterostructures as a feasible material platform for engineering and detecting helical topological edge transport without time-reversal symmetry, thus expanding the landscape of topological matter and providing new opportunities for quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Band bending and zero-conductance resonances controlled by edge electric fields in zigzag silicene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the band structure and transport property of a zigzag silicene nanoribbon when the electric fields are applied to the edges. It is found that a band bending could be induced and controlled by the antisymmetric edge fields, which can be understood based on the wave functions of the edge states. The highest valence band and the lowest conduction band coexist in the band bending region. With the narrowing of edge potentials, the bending increases gradually. When the edge fields become symmetric, an asymmetric band gap at the Dirac points can be obtained due to the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, suggesting a valley polarized quantum spin Hall state. The gap could reach a maximum value rapidly and then decrease slowly as the electric fields increase. Due to the combining effect of the band bending, band selective rule, and resonant states, many zero-conductance resonances and resonance peaks appear in different regions, which could be described by the Fano resonance effect. Furthermore, the band bending and zero-conductance resonances are robust against the Hubbard interaction. The Hubbard interaction could work as a spin-dependent edge field, together with the edge electric fields, leading to a spin-dependent band gap and various quantum phases such as metal and half-metal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic doublet ground state (GS) of a quantum dot (QD) could be changed to a spin-singlet GS by coupling to a superconductor. In analogy, here we study the GS phase transitions in QD-Majorana zero mode (MZM) coupling systems: GS behaves phase transition versus intra-dot energy level and QD-MZM coupling strength. The phase diagrams of GS are obtained, for cases with and without Zeeman term. Along with the phase transition, we also study the change of spin feature and density of states. The properties of the phase transition are understood via a mean-field picture. Our study not only serves as an analogue to QD-superconductor phase transitions, but also gives alternative explanations on MZM-relevant experiments.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of crossed Andreev reflection and spin-valley switch in antiferromagnet/superconductor junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the subgap transport through the antiferromagnet/superconductor (AF/S) and antiferromagnet/superconductor/antiferromagnet (AF/S/AF) junctions controlled by electric field in a generic buckled honeycomb system, such as silicene, germanene, and stanene. In the present of electric field and antiferromagnetic exchange field, the spin-valley polarized half metallic phase can be achieved in the honeycomb system due to the spin-orbit coupling, which affords an opportunity to generate the pure crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). It is found that the pure CAR can be generated without local Andreev reflection (AR) and elastic cotunneling (EC) over a wide range of electric field. A spin-valley switch effect can be realized between the pure CAR and the pure EC by adjusting the electric field. The properties of AR process and CAR process strongly depend on the spin-valley polarized states. Our results suggest that the device can implement an electrical measurement of the CAR process and spin-valley switch.</description>

      <title>Orbital hybridization in graphene-based artificial atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation are the two fundamental processes when real atoms are condensed to form matter. Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation has been extensively observed in various artificial atoms. However, direct evidence of the intraatomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we, for the first time, realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Magnetoresistance Effect in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an unconventional magnet, altermagnetism attracts great interest in condensed matter physics and applies a new research platform for the spintronics. Since the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is an important research aspect in spintronics, we theoretically propose a universal altermagnetic sandwich device to achieve the TMR effect and investigate its transport properties. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula, we obtain the conductance and the TMR ratio. By systematically rotating the orientations of the altermagnet and spin, we investigate how the altermagnetic orientations affect the conductance and the TMR ratio, and comprehensively demonstrate the dependence of the conductance and the TMR ratio on a range of parameters in the system. By tuning the altermagnetism strength and the Fermi energy, as well as rotating the orientations in the altermagnet, the TMR ratio can reach a value of over 1000%. In addition, we analyze the detailed symmetry relations of the conductance and the TMR ratio in our system. Our approach provides a new design concept for the next-generation information technologies based on the altermagnetic platform, paving the way for the development of spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley polarized edge states and quantum anomalous Hall states controlled by side potential in 2D honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the tight-binding formalism, we study the effect of side potential on the spin and valley related electronic property of $2$D honeycomb lattices with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, such as silicene and germanene. The side potential is composed of potential field and exchange field applied on the boundaries of the zigzag nanoribbon. It is found that the side potential could greatly affect the helical edge states with different spin indices and the spin and valley are locked to each other. By adjusting the side potential and ribbon width, the system shows quantum spin-valley Hall effect, valley polarized quantum spin Hall effect, and spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect. Due to the side potential and the coupling of edge states in narrow ribbon, a band gap could be opened for specific spin and the time-reversal symmetry could be broken, leading to a spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase. Various kinds of spin-valley polarized edge states are formed at the two boundaries. Furthermore, the spin-valley polarized insulating states can be used to realize a perfect spin-valley switch.</description>

Abstract: Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for exploring the exotic quantum phenomena and engineering the novel material properties in two dimensions, which could bring revolutionary developments in spintronics. This Review aims at providing an overview of recent progress on emerging moir\'e spintronics in twisted vdW materials, with a particular focus on two-dimensional magnetic materials. After a brief introduction to the general features of twisted vdW materials, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental studies on stacking-dependent interlayer magnetism, non-collinear spin textures, moir\'e magnetic exchange interactions, moir\'e skyrmions and moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the ability to accelerate the discovery and design multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics with the assistance of machine learning. We conclude with the most pressing challenges and potential opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, semiconductors and their heterostructures have underpinned both fundamental and applied research across all areas of electronics. Two-dimensional, 2D (atomically thin) semiconductors have now the potential to push further the miniaturization of electronic components, enabling the development of more efficient electronics. Here, we report on a giant anomalous zero-bias spin voltage in magnetic tunnel junctions based on 2D materials. The generation, manipulation and detection of electron spin across a nanometer-thick magnetic tunnel junction do not require any applied bias. It is achieved by exploiting high-quality ferromagnetic/semiconductor interfaces and the asymmetric diffusion of spin-up/spin-down electrons across a semiconductor p-n junction. The large spin-voltage signal exceeds 30,000% and is far greater than the highest magnetoresistance signals reported to date. Our findings reveal unexplored opportunities to transform and amplify spin information for low-power electronics.</description>

Abstract: The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the charge of tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure fractional charge in graphene. Moreover, we report the first measurement of the $e/3$ fractional charge in a graphene-based device. The simplicity and tunability of this design open a pathway to extend AD-based charge measurements to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction and Exciton Spin Relaxation in Atomically Thin Semiconductor Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a previously unexplored spin-orbit interaction mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77\,K showing a meV bright-dark splitting, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-H\"uckel-type Hamiltonian, we consider the tight-binding eigenvalue problem for a sequence of pyrene molecules forming a narrow $(2m,m)$ graphene nanoribbon. Specific features of the corresponding dispersion relation are analyzed and illustrated with several examples. It is shown that the $\pi$-electron spectrum of the pyrene oligomer includes local states, in contrast to the spectrum of linear acene, which consists only of extended states. We analyze and illustrate the difference in the behavior of
  the electron density distribution for extended and local electronic states. Explicit analytic expressions for the Green's function coefficients of the pyrene molecule are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the in-situ read-out of the spatial profile of suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers hosted on substrates with nano-structured holes. As the profiles are spatially bent, the suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers act as exciton traps with tunable luminescence intensity and energy. The tunability is realized by controlling the environmental pressure on the monolayers, which allows to control hundreds of suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers on a single substrate. The in-situ read-out is based on Fabry-P\'erot interferences and a model of the corresponding reflectance contrast maps of the investigated monolayers.</description>

      <title>Unoccupied bands in the molybdenum dichalcogenides MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present angle-resolved reflected electron spectroscopy (ARRES) data for the three molybdenum-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) \mos, \mose, and \mote. To follow the changes as the series moves from S to Se to Te in more detail, we determine accurate IV-spectra for monolayers and bulk TMDs. These experimental data sets are then compared with theoretical predictions for both the unoccupied band structure and the scattering density of states. We find good agreement, especially for lower energies where inelastic effects are relatively unimportant. Furthermore, we identify a series of interlayer resonances for which the dependence of the hybridization effects on the layer count is observed. Although these resonances bear similarity to interlayer resonances in hBN and graphene, they differ in their character, being dominated by unoccupied $d$-states of the chalcogen-atoms. The unoccupied states studied and analyzed here play a key role in all processes that require an electron to temporarily reside in a state above the vacuum level, such as in photoemission and secondary electron emission experiments.</description>

      <title>Zero and Nonzero Energy Majorana Modes in an Extended Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard Kitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations and disorder. The presence of robust Majorana edge modes beyond their zero energy variations potentially offers a step forward in the ongoing efforts to unambiguously detect Majorana modes in experiments.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reversing non-Hermitian skin accumulation with a non-local transverse switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetrically directed couplings in non-Hermitian systems cause directional amplification that leads to boundary skin state accumulation. However, counter-intuitively, the direction of accumulation may not follow that of the directed couplings. In this work, we demonstrate new mechanisms where this accumulation can be systematically reversed without modifying the couplings at all, just by adjusting the system size or boundary conditions in a different, transverse direction. Moreover, the reversed skin dynamics can be made very robust by suppressing the amplification in the original non-reversed direction. We motivate our approach through a series of warm-up models, culminating in a designed non-Hermitian Kagome lattice whereby wavepacket simulations demonstrate how robust reversed skin dynamics can be switched on/off in a non-local transverse manner. Our findings highlight how the non-trivial entanglement between the spectral loops of different PBC directions can be harnessed as a directional amplification switch, paving the way for new avenues of non-Hermitian sensing and lasing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Active Dual-Gated Graphene Transistors for Low-Noise, Drift-Stable, and Tunable Chemical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are among the most promising platforms for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing due to their high carrier mobility, large surface area, and low intrinsic noise. However, conventional single-gate GFET sensors in liquid environments suffer from severe limitations, including signal drift, charge trapping, and insufficient signal amplification. Here, we introduce a dual-gate GFET architecture that integrates a high-k hafnium dioxide local back gate with an electrolyte top gate, coupled with real-time feedback biasing. This design enables capacitive signal amplification while simultaneously suppressing gate leakage and low-frequency noise. By systematically evaluating seven distinct operational modes, we identify the Dual Mode Fixed configuration as optimal, achieving up to 20x signal gain, &gt; 15x lower drift compared with gate-swept methods, and up to 7x higher signal to noise ratio across a diverse range of analytes, including neurotransmitters, volatile organic compounds, environmental contaminants, and proteins. We further demonstrate robust, multiplexed detection using a PCB-integrated GFET sensor array, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the platform for portable, high-throughput sensing in complex environments. Together, these advances establish a versatile and stable sensing technology capable of real-time, label-free detection of molecular targets under ambient and physiological conditions, with broad applicability in health monitoring, food safety, agriculture, and environmental screening.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description>

      <title>Chiral Graviton Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations. Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states, capturing both spin-2 and spin-3/2 neutral modes.</description>

      <title>The influence of the Casimir effect on the binding potential for 3D wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide comprehensive details of how a previously overlooked entropic, or low temperature Casimir contribution, $W_C$, to the total binding potential for 3D short-ranged wetting may be determined from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The entropic contribution comes from the many microscopic configurations corresponding to a given interfacial one, which arise from bulk-like fluctuations about the mean-field (MF) constrained profile, and adds to the usual MF contribution $W_{MF}$. We determine the functional dependence of $W_C$ on the interface (and wall) shape using a boundary integral method which can be cast as a diagrammatic expansion with each diagram corresponding to successively higher-order exponentially decaying contributions. The decay of $W_C$ is qualitatively different for first-order and critical wetting with the change in form occurring at the MF tricritical point. Including the Casimir contribution to the binding potential preserves the global surface phase diagram but changes, radically, predictions for fluctuation effects at first-order and tricritical wetting, even when capillary-wave fluctuations are not considered.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Applications to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal-Symmetric Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on linearly polarized optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified by integrating the optical bound. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. We find that the resulting momentum integration of the refined TDI provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum volume (QV) variations and topological phase transitions. We argue that double QV can be treated as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Plasmon Interaction in Nanoparticle Assemblies: Role of the Dipole-Quadrupole Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.</description>

Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

      <title>Residual gauge theory for quanta of surface plasmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Distinct Lifetimes for $X$ and $Z$ Loop Measurements in a Majorana Tetron Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Influence of thermal noise on the field-driven dynamics of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the resulting energy landscape is sensitive to the field orientation relative to the easy axis. In the presence of thermal noise, the relaxation of the magnetic octupole moment in a strained Mn$_3$Sn film is composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both N\'eel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin $\boldsymbol{r}$-$\boldsymbol{s}$ coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the N\'eel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from bicyclopropylidene. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD to be metallic. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) varies between 205.83 N/m and 164.46 N/m. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Controlling Excitons in Quasi-1D Perovskites by Dielectric Screening and Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing the dimensionality of metal-halide perovskites enhances quantum and dielectric confinement, enabling tunable excitonic properties. In one dimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-, edge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural flexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also reflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation but are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a comprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral connectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton photophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing octahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex, anisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimentally synthesized organic-inorganic systems, pronounced dielectric screening effects can reduce exciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These findings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid the interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.</description>

      <title>Dielectric environment engineering via 2D material heterostructure formation on hybrid photonic crystal nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.</description>
