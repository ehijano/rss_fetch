      <title>Comparing cluster algebras on braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Braid varieties parametrize linear configurations of flags with transversality conditions dictated by positive braids. They include and generalize reduced double Bruhat cells, positroid varieties, open Bott-Samelson varieties, and Richardson varieties, among others. Recently, two cluster algebra structures were independently constructed in the coordinate rings of braid varieties: one using weaves and the other using Deodhar geometry. The main result of the article is that these two cluster algebras coincide. More generally, our comparative study matches the different concepts and results from each approach to the other, both on the combinatorial and algebraic geometric aspects.</description>

      <title>Constraining the outputs of ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algebraic varieties naturally associated with ReLU neural networks, arising from the piecewise linear structure of their outputs across activation regions in input space, and the piecewise multilinear structure in parameter space. By analyzing the rank constraints on the network outputs within each activation region, we derive polynomial equations that characterize the functions representable by the network. We further investigate conditions under which these varieties attain their expected dimension, providing insight into the expressive and structural properties of ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Birational transformations of threefold $\mathbf{Q}$-conic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\mathbf{Q}$-conic bundle is a contraction $f: X\to Z$ of a three-dimensional algebraic variety $X$ to a surface~$Z$ such that the variety~$X$ has only terminal $\mathbf{Q}$-factorial singularities, the anticanonical divisor $-K_X$ is~$f$-ample, and $\uprho(X/Z)=1$. We provide an algorithm to transform a $\mathbf{Q}$-conic bundle to its standard form.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of automorphism groups of Severi--Brauer varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify finite subgroups of automorphism groups of non-trivial Severi--Brauer varieties of dimension $p-1$, where $p \ge 3$ is prime, over an arbitrary field whose characteristic is coprime to $p$. In addition, we construct a universal example in the case when the base field has characteristic 0; that is, we exhibit a field of characteristic 0 together with a non-trivial Severi--Brauer variety such that every finite subgroup allowed by our classification acts on it. For positive characteristic, we provide universal examples in a weaker sense.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Fibrations onto Varieties with Isolated Quotient Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that if $f\colon M\rightarrow X$ is a germ of a projective Lagrangian fibration from a holomorphic symplectic manifold $M$ onto a normal analytic variety $X$ with isolated quotient singularities, then $X$ is smooth. In particular, if $f\colon M\rightarrow X$ is a Lagrangian fibration from a hyper-K\"ahler fourfold $M$ onto a normal surface $X$, then $X\cong \mathbb{P}^2$, which recovers a recent result of Huybrechts--Xu and Ou.</description>

Abstract: We give criteria for the existence of geometric smoothings of a proper lci scheme or a DM stack $X$ as well as for a polarized lci scheme $(X,L)$, without assuming that $X$ is reduced.

      <title>Automorphism groups and cylindricity of weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there are totally 130 deformation families of quasi-smooth terminal weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds and all members belonging to 95 families of Fano indices one are birationally rigid. Among remaining $35$ families, $15$ families have the property that general members are irrational, in particular, any of them has a finite automorphism group and is not cylindrical. In the present paper, we will observe the cylindricity and the full automorphism groups of every member in the remaining $20$ families. Moreover, we deal with the cylindricity of their forms.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of low degree points on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study points of moderately low degree on a curve $C$ over a number field, which is embedded on a nice toric surface $S$. Recently, Smith and Vogt related the linear equivalence classes of such points to intersections of $C$ with curves in the ambient surface. We show that when $C$ is sufficiently effective and ample with simple singularities, all but finitely many sufficiently low degree points are obtained via intersections of $C$ with curves in the ambient surface $S$. Our methods make use of the toric geometry of the ambient surface $S$ to produce curves which interpolate the low degree points on $C$. Furthermore, we generalise a result by Debarre and Klassen to singular plane curves and higher degrees of points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nodal curve $C$ in the complex projective plane whose irreducible components $C_i$ are smooth. A minimal set of generators $G$ for the first and second syzygy modules of the Jacobian ideal of $C$ are described, using recent results by Th. Kahle, H. Schenck, B. Sturmfels and M. Wiesmann on the likelihood correspondence. The elements of $G$ have explicit formulas in terms of the equations $f_i=0$ of the irreducible components $C_i$ of $C$.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $D_4$ via tilting bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to discuss the derived equivalence problem for a local model of the simple flop of type $D_4$, which was found by Kanemitsu. First, tilting bundles on both sides of the flop are constructed, and then those tilting bundles are applied to prove the derived equivalence. This derived equivalence for the flop deduces derived equivalences between general K3 surfaces of degree $12$. The study of this example of a flop is very similar to the author's previous work for the simple of flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, but the construction and the analysis of tilting bundles become harder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a quiver we associate a finite length monoidal abelian category which categorifies the corresponding preprojective K-theoretic Hall algebra of Varagnolo-Vasserot. The simples in this category provide a (dual) canonical basis of the Hall algebra. In particular, if the quiver is affine, this provides a basis for the positive half of the corresponding quantum toroidal algebra. We also show that this abelian category is naturally endowed with renormalized r-matrices.</description>

      <title>On a class of quasi-Hermitian surfaces in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1], a new quasi-Hermitian variety $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^r$ in $\mathrm{PG}(r, q^2)$, with $q = 2^e$ and $e \geq 3$ an odd integer, was constructed. The variety depends on a primitive element $\varepsilon$ of the underlying field $\mathrm{GF}(q^2)$.11
  In the present paper, we first provide a classification of such varieties up to projective equivalence in finite projective spaces of arbitrary dimension. Then, we focus on the case $r = 3$ and study the structure of the lines contained in $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^3$; as a consequence, we determine the full automorphism group of $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^3$ . Finally, as a byproduct, we prove the equivalence of certain minimal codes introduced in [3].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between the set of all non-negative multivariate homogeneous polynomials and those, which we call hyperwrons, whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the Wronskians of hyperbolic polynomials. We give a sufficient condition on positive integers $m$ and $2y$ such that there are non-negative polynomials of degree $2y$ in $m$ variables that are not hyperwrons. Furthermore, we give an explicit example of a non-negative quartic form that is not a sum of hyperwrons. We partially extend our results to hyperzouts, which are polynomials whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the B\'ezoutians of hyperbolic polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X be a toric variety over a field K determined by a triangle. Let Y be the blow-up at (1,1) in X. In this paper we give some criteria for finite generation of the Cox ring of Y in the case where Y has a curve C such that C^2 \le 0 and C.E=1 (E is the exceptional divisor). The natural surjection Z^3 \rightarrow Cl(X) gives the ring homomorphism K[Z^3] \rightarrow K[Cl(X)]. We denote by I the kernel of the composite map K[x,y,z] \subset K[Z^3] \rightarrow K[Cl(X)]. Then Cox(Y) coincides with the extended symbolic Rees ring R's(I). In the case where Cl(X) is torsion-free, this ideal I is the defining ideal of a space monomial curve.
  Let Delta be the triangle (4.1) below. Then I is the ideal of K[x,y,z] generated by 2-minors of the 2*3-matrix {{x^7, y^2, z},{y^{11}, z, x^{10}}}. (In this case, there exists a curve C with C^2=0 and C.E=1. This ideal I is not a prime ideal.) Applying our criteria, we prove that R's(I) is Noetherian if and only if the characteristic of K is 2 or 3.</description>

      <title>The canonical form, scissors congruence and adjoint degrees of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical form $\Omega$ as a valuation in the context of scissors congruence for polytopes. We identify the degree of its numerator - the adjoint polynomial $\operatorname{adj}_P$ - as an important invariant in this context. More precisely, for a polytope $P$ we define the degree drop that measures how much smaller than expected the degree of the adjoint polynomial of $P$ is. We show that this drop behaves well under various operations, such as decompositions, restrictions to faces, projections, products and Minkowski sums. Next we define the reduced canonical form $\Omega_0$ and show that it is a translation-invariant 1-homogeneous valuation on polytopes that vanishes if and only if $P$ has positive degree drop. Using it we can prove that zonotopes can be characterized as the $d$-polytopes that have maximal possible degree drop $d-1$. We obtain a decomposition formula for $\Omega_0$ that expresses it as a sum of edge-local quantities of $P$. Finally, we discuss valuations $\Omega_s$ that can distinguish higher values of the degree drop.</description>

      <title>Bases of Riemann-Roch spaces associated with arbitrary elliptic curve divisors and their application in constructing various elliptic Codes families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine explicit bases for Riemann--Roch spaces associated with various families of elliptic codes. We establish the feasibility and provide exact algorithms for constructing bases of Riemann--Roch spaces corresponding to arbitrary divisors on elliptic curves. These results are subsequently applied to derive bases for quasi-cyclic elliptic codes and their subfield subcodes as well as for the class of Goppa-like elliptic codes. For algebraic geometry code applications, having an explicit description of Riemann--Roch space bases for arbitrary divisors is particularly valuable as it simultaneously enables efficient code construction and reveals structural properties of the codes leading to the new cryptanalysis methods when these codes are employed in cryptographic schemes</description>

      <title>Coupled KPZ equations and their decoupleability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss characterizations of the decoupleability, partial and full, of trilinear or completely symmetric real $n\times n\times n$ tensors, which inform on the structure of certain coupled KPZ equations. Informally, when the tensor is partially decoupleable, one of the components in the coupled KPZ equation splits off from the others, while when the tensor is fully decoupleable, each of the $n$ components splits off from the others.
  Such a characterization is recast as a problem of membership of trilinear tensors in $O(n)$ orbits of subsets of fully decoupleable and partially decoupleable tensors. When $n=2$, we show these subsets are the same, and in this case give a single criterion in terms of the entries of a tensor for membership in the orbits of these subsets. When $n\geq 3$, the subsets are different. For $n\geq 3$, we characterize full decoupleability in terms of several abstract relations, which when $n=3$ are made explicit. When $n=3$, we also explicitly characterize partial decoupleability.
  The methods involve notions in applied invariant theory, relating $O(n)$ invariant subsets to stabilizer subgroup actions on smaller sets. When $n=3$ make use of the explicit basis of invariants found by Olive and Auffray. When $n=2$, we also supply two other more direct arguments.</description>

Abstract: For any prism $(A, d)$, we construct an analogue of Fontaine's map $W_r(A/d) \to A/d\phi(d)\cdots\phi^{r-1}(d)$. Subsequently, we define a canonical map from de Rham-Witt forms to prismatic cohomology in the perfect case and prove that it is an isomorphism. Using this result, we obtain an explicit description of the prismatic cohomology for a $p$-completed polynomial algebra over $A/d$.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry for Quiver Algebroid Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03028v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new construction of quiver algebroid stacks and the associated mirror functors for symplectic manifolds. First, we formulate the concept of a quiver stack, which is a geometric structure formed by gluing multiple quiver algebras together. Next, we develop a representation theory of $A_\infty$ categories by quiver stacks. The main idea is to extend the $A_\infty$ category over a quiver stack of a collection of nc-deformed objects. The extension involves non-trivial gerbe terms. It gives an application of symplectic geometry that bridges the study of sheaves and representation theory through mirror symmetry.
  We provide a general framework for constructing mirror quiver stacks. In particular, we develop a novel method of gluing Lagrangians which are disjoint from each other by using quasi-isomorphisms with a `global middle agent', which is a Lagrangian immersion that produces a mirror quiver. The method relies fundamentally on the use of quiver stacks. We carry out this construction for compact immersed Lagrangians in a punctured elliptic curve, which results in a mirror nc local projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As in algebraic geometry, an effective divisor class on a vertex-weighted graph is called special if also its residual class is effective. We study the question, when this is true already on the level of divisors; that is, when there exists an effective divisor in the class whose residual is effective as well, so called uniform divisors. We show that uniform divisors exist in any special class on graphs with all vertex weights non-zero; we show that in general a representative can be chosen, whose value is off by at most one on vertices of weight zero. To prove this, we generalize the notion of divisors that are reduced with respect to a vertex to divisors that are reduced with respect to a set of vertices. We compare this notion to a previous generalization due to Luo. As an application, we obtain a new algorithm to determine whether a divisor class is effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Univariate polynomials are called stable with respect to a domain $D$ if all of their roots lie in $D$. We study linear slices of the space of stable univariate polynomials with respect to a half-plane. We show that a linear slice always contains a stable polynomial with only a few distinct roots. Subsequently, we apply these results to symmetric polynomials and varieties. We show that for varieties defined by few multiaffine symmetric polynomials, the existence of a point in $D^n$ with few distinct coordinates is necessary and sufficient for the intersection with $D^n$ to be non-empty. This is at the same time a generalization of the so-called degree principle to stable polynomials and a result similar to Grace-Walsh-Szeg\H{o}'s coincidence theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1995, Koll\'ar conjectured that a smooth complex projective $n$-fold $X$ with generically large fundamental group has Euler characteristic $\chi(X, K_X)\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture assuming $X$ has linear fundamental group, i.e., there exists a representation $\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ with finite kernel. We deduce the conjecture by proving a stronger $L^2$ vanishing theorem: for the universal cover $\widetilde{X}$ of such $X$, its $L^2$-Dolbeault cohomology $H_{(2)}^{n,q}(\widetilde{X})=0$ for $q\neq 0$. The main ingredients of the proof are techniques from the linear Shafarevich conjecture along with some analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Equivariant aspects of de-completing cyclic homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derived de Rham cohomology turns out to be important in $p$-adic geometry, following Bhatt's discovery [Bha12] of conjugate filtration in char $p$, de-Hodge-completing results in [Bei12]. In [Kal18], Kaledin introduced an analogous de-completion of the periodic cyclic homology, called the polynomial periodic cyclic homology, equipped with a conjugate filtration in char $p$, and expected to be related to derived de Rham cohomology. In this article, using genuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18, BHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic cyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness assumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology becomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to "topological" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the topological periodic cyclic homology, which admits an extension to linear categories over truncated Brown--Peterson spectra. As an application, we establish a noncommutative crystalline--de Rham comparison, which decompletes the result in [PV19], and extends it to prime $p=2$. We also compare polynomial periodic cyclic homology to topological Hochschild homology over $\mathbb F_p$, and produce a conjugate filtration in char p from our description.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we complete the study of the Lan-Sheng-Zuo conjecture proposed in arXiv:1210.8280 for the curve case. Precisely, we prove that every semistable Higgs bundle is strongly semistable for curves of genus $g\leq 1$, and over any curves of genus $g\ge2$ construct explicit examples of semistable Higgs bundles of arbitrary big rank (the first example is $p=2,r=3$) which are not strongly semistable. These results are complementary to the strongly semistability theorem of Lan-Sheng-Yang-Zuo and Langer for semistable Higgs bundles of small rank.</description>

Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen Bundles of Quintic Covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth irreducible curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. We classify the bundles that arise this way when $d = 5$. Equivalently, we classify which $\mathbb{P}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain smooth irreducible degree $5$ covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Our main contribution is proving the existence of smooth covers whose structure sheaf has the desired pushforward. We do this by showing that the substack of singular curves has positive codimension in the moduli stack of finite flat covers with desired pushforward. To compute the dimension of the space of singular curves, we prove a (relative) ``minimization theorem'', which is the geometric analogue of Bhargava's sieving argument when computing the densities of discriminants of quintic number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.04600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quartic analogue of the Kontsevich model, which is defined by a measure $\exp(-{N}\,\mathrm{Tr}(E\Phi^2+(\lambda/4)\Phi^4)) d\Phi$ on Hermitian ${N}\times{N}$-matrices, where $E$ is any positive matrix and $\lambda$ a scalar. It was previously established that the large-$N$ limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation. By employing tools from complex analysis, in particular the Lagrange-B\"urmann inversion formula, we identify the exact solution of this non-linear problem, both for finite $N$ and for a large-${N}$ limit to unbounded operators $E$ of spectral dimension $\leq 4$. For finite $N$, the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function $R$ constructed from the spectrum of $E$. Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family $\omega_{g,n}$ of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators $E$, the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of $R$. This allowed a proof, in subsequent work, that the $\lambda\Phi^4_4$-model on noncommutative Moyal space does not have a triviality problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the objective function value and the Hessian spectrum. The results enable an analytic characterization of various obstructions to local optimization methods, revealing, in particular, a complex array of saddles and minima that differ in their symmetry, structure, and analytic properties. A notable phenomenon, observed for all critical points considered, concerns the index of the Hessian increasing with the objective function value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bimatroid is a matroid-like generalization of the collection of regular minors of a matrix. In this article, we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials to study the logarithmic concavity of natural sequences associated to bimatroids. Bimatroids can be used to characterize morphisms of matroids and this observation (originally due to Kung) allows us to prove a weak version of logarithmic concavity of the number of bases of a morphism of matroids. This is weaker than the original result by Eur and Huh; it nevertheless provides us with a new perspective on Mason's log-concavity conjecture for independent sets of matroids. We finally show that for realizable bimatroids, the regular minor polynomial is a volume polynomial. Applied to morphisms of matroids, this shows that the weak basis generating polynomial of a morphism is a volume polynomial; this confirms a conjecture of Eur--Huh for morphisms of nullity $\leq 1$ and gives an algebro-geometric explanation for Mason's log-concavity conjecture in the realizable case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Lie superheaps as a generalisation of Lie supergroups. We show that the well-known `groupification' and `heapification' functors generalise to the ambience of supergeometry. In particular, we show that there is an isomorphism between the categories of pointed Lie superheaps and Lie supergroups. To do this we make extensive use of the functor of points.</description>
