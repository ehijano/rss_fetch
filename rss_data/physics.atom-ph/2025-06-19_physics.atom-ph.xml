      <title>Effect of surface magnetism on the x-ray spectra of hollow atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence that the detection of surface magnetism without the application of an external magnetic field is possible by studying the x-ray emission of highly charged ions interacting at grazing incidence with the sample. Measuring the 3 keV $n=2 \to 1$ transition in the interaction of Ar\textsuperscript{17+} with a nickel sample at various temperatures gives access to the $n=2$ ion population. The latter evolves from a half-filled to a full shell during the ferro-paramagnetic phase transition of the sample, with the ferromagnetic phase reflecting the filling blocking due to Pauli principle. This finding puts an end to a longstanding controversy arising from contradictory studies of ion--surface interaction using Auger spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Response of Comagnetometer to Exotic Spin-Dependent Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comagnetometers offer unique advantages in measuring exotic spin-dependent interactions by suppressing magnetic noise. Understanding the frequency response to exotic interactions is essential for evaluating and improving the sensitivity of comagnetometers, as the signals often exhibit distinct spectral features. We conduct theoretical and experimental studies on the frequency response of a differential comagnetometer. We derive analytical expressions for the frequency response of the differential comagnetometer to both magnetic field and exotic couplings, along with the conversion relationship between them. Based on this, we revise the method for determining the axion-nucleon coupling strength with comagnetometers. Furthermore, we introduce a light-shift-based calibration protocol to verify the response to exotic interactions. This work helps predict the sensitivity of comagnetometers in detecting exotic fields and advances the exploration of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of trapped ions and dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of an unshielded dielectric $\unicode{x2013}$ here, a bare optical fiber $\unicode{x2013}$ on a $^{40}$Ca${^+}$ ion held several hundred $\mu$m away in a cryogenic surface electrode trap. We observe distance-dependent stray electric fields of up to a few kV/m due to the dielectric, which drift on average less than 10% per month and can be fully compensated with reasonable voltages on the trap electrodes. We observe ion motional heating rates attributable to the dielectric of $\approx$30 quanta per second at an ion-fiber distance of 215(4) $\mu$m and $\approx$1.5 MHz motional frequency. These results demonstrate the viability of using unshielded, trap-integrated dielectric objects such as miniature optical cavities or other optical elements in cryogenic surface electrode ion traps.</description>

      <title>Selective Bond Breaking in CO$_2^{2+}$ Induced by Photoelectron Recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After core-ionization of CO$_2$, typically an Auger-Meitner decay takes place, leading to the formation of a dicationic molecule that may dissociate into CO$^+$ and O$^+$. We demonstrate experimentally that the recoil momentum of the photoelectron steers, which of the two equivalent bonds breaks during the dissociation. At 20 keV photon energy, we observe an asymmetry of up to 25% for bond cleavage that depends on the emission direction of the photoelectron. Furthermore, we show that this effect leads to a significant nondipole effect in molecular dissociation in the laboratory frame: O$^+$ fragments are more likely to be emitted in the direction opposite to the light propagation than along it.</description>

      <title>Microgravity-assisted off-axis spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of the ground state of a spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate with the assistance of an optical plug has been studied. However, gravity is everywhere, and this potential linear dependence on the spatial position will destroy the axisymmetric structure of the system with the optical plug. In this case, the question of whether the spin vortex ground state still exists remains unresolved. The present study aims to explore the impact of microgravity on the formation of the spin vortex state with the assistance of an optical plug. To this end, a simple model has been employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Gross-Pitaevskii equations are solved by setting the optical plug intensity, adjusting the optical plug width, and adjusting the microgravity strength. This process results in the phase diagram for the single-mode state and spin vortex state. Under microgravity situations, we observe an off-axis structure of the spin vortex state. Our calculations offer a reliable approach to generating spin vortex states in a microgravity environment.</description>

      <title>Fast, continuous and coherent atom replacement in a neutral atom qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Applications of maximum likelihood estimations for analyzing photon counts in few atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the atom number distribution of few atoms in a tight optical tweezer from their fluorescence distributions. In the tight tweezer regime, the detection light causes rapid atom loss due to light-assisted collisions. This in turn leads to non-Poissonian and overlapping fluorescence distributions for different initial atom numbers, and commonly used threshold techniques fail. We use maximum likelihood estimation algorithms to fit model distributions that account for the atom loss. This gives accurate atom number distributions for relatively few experimental runs (about 600 is sufficient) to sample a photon number distribution. We show that the method can be extended to situations when the photon number distributions for known initial atom numbers cannot be modeled, at the cost of requiring a higher number of experimental runs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Modulation transfer spectroscopy of $^7$Li D1 line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) on the D$1$ line of $^7$Li, carried out in a compact heat-pipe vapor cell with cold windows. By varying the pump and probe intensities and polarization configurations, we systematically map the MTS error-signal amplitude, effective linewidth, and slope for the ground-state crossover resonance $F=1\times2\rightarrow F'=2$. We observe Rabi-induced power broadening and identify optimal conditions for laser frequency stabilization via tightly focused beams with total power below 1 mW. The lin$\perp$lin polarization configuration yields a sharp, symmetric, high-contrast error signal with a maximal slope. Our findings establish the MTS spectrum of the $^7$Li D1 line transitions as a reliable frequency reference for quantum technology and ultracold atom experiments, particularly in scenarios where frequency stabilization must be achieved with low laser optical power.</description>

      <title>Analytical Prediction of the Superradiant Emission Peak and Timing in Fully Excited Quantum Emitter Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>
