      <title>Solitary wave-mean flow interaction in strongly nonlineardispersive shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a solitary wave and a slowly varying mean background or flow for the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations is studied using Whitham modulation theory. The exact form of the three SGN-Whitham modulation equations -- two for the mean horizontal velocity and depth decoupled from one for the solitary wave amplitude field -- are obtained exactly in the solitary wave limit. Although the three equations are not diagonalizable, the restriction of the full system to simple waves for the mean equations is diagonalized in terms of Riemann invariants. The Riemann invariants are used to analytically describe the head-on and overtaking interactions of a solitary wave with a rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave (DSW), leading to scenarios of solitary wave trapping or transmission by the mean flow. The analytical results for overtaking interactions prove that a simpler, approximate approach based on the DSW fitting method is accurate to the second order in solitary wave amplitude, beyond the first order accurate Korteweg-de Vries approximation. The analytical results also accurately predict the SGN DSW's solitary wave edge amplitude and speed. The analytical results are favourably compared with corresponding numerical solutions of the full SGN equations. Because the SGN equations model the bi-directional propagation of strongly nonlinear, long gravity waves over a flat bottom, the analysis presented here describes large amplitude solitary wave-mean flow interactions in shallow water waves.</description>

      <title>Dual-mode phonon dynamics and lasing in optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the full nonlinear bifurcation theory as a powerful methodology to thoroughly classify and predict the phonon lasing dynamics in optomechanical cavities. We exemplify its scope in the very relevant and so far vaguely explored dynamics of dual-mode phonon lasing when two independent mechanical modes are directly coupled to one optical field. We uncover a plethora of different lasing regimes in a fixed and realistic cavity geometry, including single- and dual-mode lasing, perfect synchronization of different mechanical modes, and quasiperiodic time crystals. All dynamical regimes are unambiguously associated with bifurcations of different natures, which may exhibit both super and sub-critical natures characterizing the often hysteretic behavior of the systems when they are externally driven by a time-varying laser source. Our results, generalizable to any other optomechanical system, open unprecedented pathways to understand and control the formation and dynamics of optomechanical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>A flow-kick model of dryland vegetation patterns: the impact of rainfall variability on resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many drylands around the globe, vegetation self-organizes into regular spatial patterns in response to aridity stress. We consider the regularly-spaced vegetation bands, on gentle hill-slopes, that survive low rainfall conditions by harvesting additional stormwater from upslope low-infiltration bare zones. We are interested in the robustness of this pattern formation survival mechanism to changes in rainfall variability. For this, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous kicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology, that act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through the spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water and vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve together. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical simulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no variability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and magnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random elements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear. This suggests that an increase in storm variability, even with the same mean annual rainfall, may negatively impact the resilience of these pattern-forming dryland ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type II superconductors can trap a transient magnetic field and become "cryomagnets" that are very useful for applications. During this process, flux jumps i.e. sudden jumps of the total magnetization occur and hinder the properties of these magnets. To understand the electrodynamics of these systems and in particular flux jumps, we analyzed mathematically a model based on Maxwell's equations and temperature in a 1D configuration. When a magnetic pulse is applied to a superconductor, three effects occur, from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the problem, we obtain a nonlinear diffusion for the magnetic field coupled to a forced diffusion equation for the temperature with only two parameters. Two regimes occur, depending on temperature: for medium temperature the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant while for low temperature it depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. Flux jumps can be explained using the fixed points of the equations. We found that they occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature because of the nonlinear dependance. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures, so these conditions are optimal to produce better cryomagnets.</description>
