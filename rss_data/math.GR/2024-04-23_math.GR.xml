      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on dihedral and alternating groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on algebras, which appeared in 1960, have connections with different versions of the Yang-Baxter equation, pre- and postalgebras, double Poisson algebras, etc. In 2020, the notion of Rota-Baxter operator on a group was defined by L. Guo, H. Lang, Yu. Sheng.
  In 2023, V. Bardakov and the second author showed that all Rota-Baxter operators on simple sporadic groups are splitting, i. e. they are defined via exact factorizations. In the current work, we clarify for which $n$, there exist non-splitting Rota-Baxter operators on the alternating group $\mathrm{A}_n$. For the corresponding $n$, we describe all non-splitting Rota-Baxter operators on $\mathrm{A}_n$. Moreover, we describe Rota-Baxter operators on dihedral groups $D_{2n}$ providing the general construction which lies behind all non-splitting Rota-Baxter operators on $\mathrm{A}_n$ and $D_{2n}$.</description>

      <title>Weights for $\pi$-partial characters of $\pi$-separable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to confirm an inequality predicted by Isaacs and Navarro in 1995, which asserts that for any $\pi'$-subgroup $Q$ of a $\pi$-separable group $G$, the number of $\pi'$-weights of $G$ with $Q$ as the first component always exceeds that of irreducible $\pi$-partial characters of $G$ with $Q$ as their vertex. We also give some sufficient condition to guarantee that these two numbers are equal, and thereby strengthen their main theorem on the $\pi$-version of the Alperin weight conjecture.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups.
  Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of CAT(-1) geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations. We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank.</description>

      <title>Preserving self-similarity in free products of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.12810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve on earlier results on the closure under free products of the class of automaton semigroups. We consider partial automata and show that the free product of two self-similar semigroups (or automaton semigroups) is self-similar (an automaton semigroup) if there is a homomorphism from one of the base semigroups to the other. The construction used is computable and yields further consequences. One of them is that we can adjoin a free generator to any self-similar semigroup (or automaton semigroup) and preserve the property of self-similarity (or being an automaton semigroup).
  The existence of a homomorphism between two semigroups is a very lax requirement; in particular, it is satisfied if one of the semigroups contains an idempotent. To explore the limits of this requirement, we show that no simple or $0$-simple idempotent-free semigroup is a finitely generated self-similar semigroup (or an automaton semigroup). Furthermore, we give an example of a pair of residually finite semigroups without a homomorphism from one to the other.</description>

      <title>The category of partial group actions: quotients, (co)limits and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the category of partial actions, where the group and the set upon which the group acts can vary. Within this framework, we develop a theory of quotient partial actions and prove that this category is both (co)complete and encompasses the category of groupoids as a full subcategory.
  In particular, we establish the existence of a pair of adjoint functors, denoted as $\Phi : \textbf{Grpd} \to \textbf{ParAct}$ and $\Psi : \textbf{ParAct} \to \textbf{Grpd}$, with the property that $\Psi \Phi \cong 1_{\textbf{Grpd} }$.
  Next, for a given groupoid $\Gamma$, we provide a characterization of all partial actions that allow the recovery of the groupoid $\Gamma$ through $\Psi$. This characterization is expressed in terms of certain normal subgroups of a universal group constructed from $\Gamma.$</description>

      <title>Coxeter embeddings are injective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain embeddings of Coxeter groups within other Coxeter groups are injective using the notion of Coxeter partitions. Moreover, we study Lusztig's partitions, which are generalizations of Lusztig's admissible maps and Crisp's foldings. We show that they classify the simplest type of Coxeter partitions, whose embeddings of Coxeter groups send each generator to a product of commuting generators. Consequently, these embeddings are also injective, and we prove that they preserve Coxeter numbers. These results were previously known, due to work of M\"{u}hlherr and Dyer.</description>

      <title>Groups Acting Generically Multiply Transitively on Solvable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we complete the classification of generically multiply transitive actions of groups on solvable groups in the finite Morley rank setting. We prove that if $G$ is a connected group of finite Morley rank acting definably, faithfully and generically $m$-transitively on a connected solvable group $V$ of finite Morley rank where $\operatorname{rk}(V)\leqslant m$, then $\operatorname{rk}(V)=m$, $V$ is a vector space of dimension $m$ over an algebraically closed field $F$, $G\cong \operatorname{GL}_m(F)$, and the action is equivalent to the natural action of $\operatorname{GL}_m(F)$ on $F^m$. This generalises our previous work arXiv:2107.09997. As an application of our result, we classify definably primitive groups of finite Morley rank and affine type acting on a set $X$ with a generic transitivity degree of $\operatorname{rk}(X)+1$.</description>

      <title>Groups with supersolvable automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a finite group G ultrasolvable if it has a characteristic subgroup series whose factors are cyclic. It was shown by Durbin--McDonald that the automorphism group of an ultrasolvable group is supersolvable. The converse statement was established by Baartmans--Woeppel under the hypothesis that G has no direct factor isomorphic to the Klein four-group. We extend this result by proving that Aut(G) is supersolvable if and only if G is ultrasolvable or G=H\times C_2\times C_2 where H is ultrasolvable of odd order. This corrects an erroneous claim by Corsi Tani. Our proof is more elementary than Baartmans--Woeppel's and uses some ideas of Corsi Tani and Laue.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy class fusion from four maximal subgroups of the Monster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the conjugacy class fusion from certain maximal subgroups of the Monster to the Monster, to justify the addition of these data to the Character Table Library in the computational algebra system GAP. The maximal subgroups in question are $(\text{PSL}_2(11) {\times} \text{PSL}_2(11)){:}4$, $11^2{:}(5 {\times} 2\text{A}_5)$, $7^2{:}\text{SL}_2(7)$, and $\text{PSL}_2(19){:}2$. Our proofs are supported by reproducible calculations carried out using the Python package mmgroup, a computational construction of the Monster recently developed by Seysen.</description>

      <title>Semisimple elements and the little Weyl group of real semisimple $Z_m$-graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the semisimple orbits of a Vinberg $\theta$-representation. First we take the complex numbers as base field. By a case by case analysis we show a technical result stating the equality of two sets of hyperplanes, one corresponding to the restricted roots of a Cartan subspace, the other corresponding to the complex reflections in the (little) Weyl group. The semisimple orbits have representatives in a finite number of sets that correspond to reflection subgroups of the (little) Weyl group. One of the consequences of our technical result is that the elements in a fixed such set all have the same stabilizer in the acting group. Secondly we study what happens when the base field is the real numbers. We look at Cartan subspaces and show that the real Cartan subspaces can be classified by the first Galois cohomology set of the normalizer of a fixed real Cartan subspace. In the real case the orbits can be classified using Galois cohomology. However, in order for that to work we need to know which orbits have a real representative. We show a theorem that characterizes the orbits of homogeneous semisimple elements that do have such a real representative. This closely follows and generalizes a theorem from \cite{bgl}.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by Babillot. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>
