      <title>Positive energy-momentum theorems for asymptotically AdS spin initial data sets with charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For complete spin initial data sets with an asymptotically anti--de Sitter end, we introduce a charged energy--momentum defined as a linear functional arising from the Einstein--Maxwell constraints. Under a dominant energy condition adapted to the presence of a negative cosmological constant, we establish positive energy--momentum theorems, showing in particular that this functional is non--negative on a natural real cone. We place particular emphasis on the case where the manifold carries a compact inner boundary. In the time--symmetric setting, this yields a mass--charge inequality for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with charge.</description>

      <title>On examples of duals Saito's basis of some inhomogeneous divisors, and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of non-quasi-homogeneous free divisors in the sense of Saito. These divisors are defined by equations of the form $D:= \{h=0\}$ on $\mathbb{C}^p$, where the polynomial $h$ is specific linear combination of monomials involving the product of coordinates. For this class, we explicitly construct a Saito basis for the module of logarithmic vector fields $Der(logD)$. This construction is then applied to the setting of logarithmic Poisson geometry. Focusing on the example defined by $h=xy+x^{2}y^{2}+x^3y^3$ on the Poisson algebra $(\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{C}[x,y], \{-,-\}_{h})$, where the Poisson bracket is induced by the bivector $\pi = h\partial x\wedge\partial y$. We define the associated Koszul bracket on the module of logarithmic 1-forms. This enables us to prove that $\pi$ endows the sheaf of logarithmic 1-forms $\Omega^{1}(log D )$ with a Lie-Rinehart algebra structure. Furthermore, we introduce and provide explicit descriptions for the resulting cohomology theory, which we term the logarithmic Poisson cohomology $H_{log}^{\bullet} $ of $\{-,-\}_{h}$. As a related and foundational computation, we also calculate the corresponding logarithmic De Rham cohomology $H^{\bullet}_{DR}$ for the divisor $D$ and we make a generalization in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Hodge decomposition for Kato manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any Kato manifold satisfies the Hodge decomposition, in the sense that $b_k=\sum_{p+q=k}h^{p, q}$, by relating its cohomology to the corresponding cohomology of its modification data. We give, therefore, more evidence supporting a conjecture of Ornea--Verbitsky stating that compact locally conformally K\"ahler manifolds satisfy the Hodge decomposition. We further study Bott--Chern and Aeppli cohomology of Kato manifolds, showing that in certain degrees they coincide with Dolbeault cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we construct a modification $S(M)$ of the twistor space of a K\"ahler scalar flat surface $M$ and study its complex-geometric and metric properties. In particular, we construct complete balanced metrics on $S(M)$ and show that $S(M)$ can not be K\"ahler when $M$ is a compact simple hyperk\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Operators, Integral Curvature, and the Euler Characteristic of Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new connections between integral curvature bounds and the Euler characteristic of closed Riemannian manifolds through the perspective of Schr\"odinger-type operators. Central to our approach is the twisted Dirac operator \(\mathcal{D}_{\theta}\), whose index equals \(\chi(M)\). Under integral smallness conditions on the negative part of a potential \(V\) and a Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequality, we show that a suitable scaling of \(\theta\) forces the kernel of \(\mathcal{D}_{t\theta}\) to vanish, thereby implying \(\chi(M)=0\).
  Applying this framework to geometrically natural potentials yields several topological consequences. In even dimensions, sufficiently small integral bounds on partial sums of curvature operator eigenvalues force \(\chi(M)\) either to vanish or to have a sign determined by the middle dimension. For four-manifolds, a small \(L^{p}\)-norm of the negative Ricci curvature relative to the diameter guarantees \(\chi(M)\ge 0\). Moreover, when \(\chi(M)\neq 0\) we obtain a Li--Yau type lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the rough Laplacian on \(1\)-forms in terms of the diameter and an integral curvature quantity. Subsequently, we provide an explicit lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $1$-forms under almost nonnegative curvature conditions, thereby giving an affirmative answer to Yau's Problem 79.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an optimal systolic inequality and characterize the case of equality on closed Riemannian manifolds with positive triRic curvature. This extends prior work of Bray-Brendle-Neves \cite{BrayBrenleNevesrigidity} and Chu-Lee-Zhu \cite{chuleezhu_n_systole} to higher codimensions. The proof relies on the notion of stable weighted $k$-slicing, a weighted volume comparison theorem and metric-deformation.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Hodge correspondence over singular K\"ahler spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-abelian Hodge correspondence over compact K\"ahler spaces with Kawamata log terminal (klt) singularities as well as over their regular loci, thereby extending the result of Greb-Kebekus-Peternell-Taji for projective klt varieties to the context of compact K\"ahler klt spaces. The proof relies on two key ingredients: first, we establish an equivalence over the regular loci-via harmonic bundles-between polystable Higgs bundles with vanishing orbifold Chern numbers and semi-simple flat bundles; second, we prove a descent theorem for semistable Higgs bundles with vanishing Chern classes along resolutions of singularities. As an application of our framework, we obtain a quasi-uniformization theorem for projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor that satisfy the orbifold Miyaoka-Yau equality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties associated with the $\mathfrak{g}$-stability of surfaces with boundary whose null expansion satisfies $\Theta^{+} = h \geq 0$. First, we show that a $\mathfrak{g}$-stable hypersurface with free boundary admits a metric of positive scalar curvature with minimal boundary under suitable conditions. Second, for $\mathfrak{g}$-stable surfaces with free boundary, we derive an area estimate and determine the topology of the surface. Finally, we extend our free boundary results to the case of capillary boundary.</description>

      <title>Parallel mean curvature surfaces with constant contact angle along free boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify branched immersed disks in space forms with non-zero parallel mean curvature vector and non-orthogonal constant contact angle along the boundary in 4-dimensional space form. For higher codimensional case, we prove a codimension reduction theorem for branched immersed bordered Riemann surfaces of higher genus with multiple boundary components under the same parallel mean curvature and constant contact angle assumptions. Furthermore, we construct a family of explicit examples of branched minimal immersions satisfying the non-orthonormal constant contact angle free boundary condition, which demonstrate the sharpness of both the classification result and the codimension reduction result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if the curvature of a Cartan-Hadamard $n$-manifold is constant near a convex hypersurface $\Gamma$, then the total Gauss-Kronecker curvature $\mathcal{G}(\Gamma)$ is not less than that of any convex hypersurface nested inside $\Gamma$. This extends Borb\'{e}ly's monotonicity theorem in hyperbolic space. It follows that $\mathcal{G}(\Gamma)$ is bounded below by the volume of the unit sphere in Euclidean space $\mathbf{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Attached Submanifolds Beyond Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study submanifold geometry in the presence of symmetry, focusing on submanifolds of solvmanifolds with an unusual property relative to Ricci curvature. We generalize work of H. Tamaru \cite{tamaru-11} in which he explores the geometry of submanifolds of symmetric spaces of noncompact type constructed from parabolic subgroups of the isometry group. He calls these attached submanifolds. The Ricci curvatures of attached submanifolds coincide with the restrictions of the Ricci curvatures of ambient symmetric spaces.
  We broaden Tamaru's construction by weakening the hypotheses on the ambient space, allowing a pseudo-Riemannian scalar product, and defining attached submanifolds in terms of root spaces. We demonstrate that in this setting, the Ricci curvature restriction property for attached submanifolds holds if and only if the submanifold satisfies an algebraic criterion that we call the Jacobi Star Condition. Like attached submanifolds of symmetric spaces, our attached submanifolds are minimal, and are only totally geodesic under hypotheses analogous to hypotheses in the symmetric space case.
  Finally, we give an example of a solvmanifold that has an attached submanifold and is not a symmetric space, demonstrating that attached submanifolds are not unique to symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Kenmotsu Contact Geometry Through the Lens of $\ast-\boldsymbol{\kappa}$-Ricci-Bourguignon Almost Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of the newly introduced $\ast-\boldsymbol{\kappa}$-Ricci-Bourguignon almost soliton pertaining to Kenmotsu structure manifolds. Our analysis concerns the characteristics of this soliton and derive the scalar curvature for a Kenmotsu manifold admitting such a structure. Further, we formulate the corresponding vector fields under the assumption that the manifold supports a $\ast-\boldsymbol{\kappa}-$Ricci-Bourguignon soliton. Additionally, we explore applications involving torse-forming vector fields within the framework of the $\ast-\boldsymbol{\kappa}-$Ricci-Bourguignon almost soliton on Kenmotsu structure manifolds. To support the theoretical findings, we provide a concrete illustration belonging to a $\ast-\boldsymbol{\kappa}-$Ricci-Bourguignon almost soliton in a 5D Kenmotsu structure manifold.</description>

      <title>closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with $\mathbb{T}^3$-symmetry and hypersymplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures $\varphi$ with an effective $\mathbb{T}^3$-symmetry on connected manifolds are roughly classified into three types according to the evaluation of $\varphi$ on the principal orbits. Type 1: if there is neither associative nor isotropic orbit, then the action is free and $\varphi$ reduces to a hypersymplectic structure on the quotient manifold admitting three linearly independent closed 1-forms; in particular, it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{T}^4$ if the manifold is compact. Type 2: if some orbit is associative, then the action is almost-free and $\varphi$ reduces to a good hypersymplectic orbifold with cyclic isotropic groups. Type 3: if some orbit is isotropic, then the action is locally multi-Hamiltonian for $\varphi$. Moreover, the open and dense subset of principal orbits is foliated by $\mathbb{T}^3$-invariant hypersymplectic manifolds. If $\varphi$ is torsion-free and complete, then the hypersymplectic manifold is flat and $\varphi$ is flat for Type 1; the good hypersymplectic orbifold is good hyperk\"ahler orbifold for Type 2; $\varphi$ is locally toric for Type 3. As shown, hypersymplectic structures have intimate link with closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure with effective $\mathbb{T}^3$-symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Harnack inequality without convexity for curve shortening flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Hamilton introduced a Harnack inequality for convex solutions of the mean curvature flow. In this paper we prove an alternative Harnack inequality for curve shortening flow, i.e. one-dimensional mean curvature flow, that does not require any assumption of convexity. For an initial proper curve in the plane whose ends are radial lines but which is otherwise arbitrarily wild, we use the Harnack inequality to give an explicit time by which the curve shortening flow evolution must become graphical. This gives a new instance of delayed parabolic regularity. The Harnack inequality also gives estimates describing how a polar graphical flow with radial ends settles down to an expanding solution. Finally, we relate our Harnack inequality to Hamilton's by identifying a pointwise curvature estimate implied by both Harnack inequalities in the special case of convex flows.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves that, in mean curvature flow of a compact surface in a complete $3$-manifold with Ricci curvature bounded below, the genus of the regular set is a decreasing function of time as long as the only singularities are given by shrinking sphere and shrinking cylinder tangent flows. The paper also proves some local versions of that fact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we introduce the notion of basic Albanese map which we define for foliated Riemannian manifolds using basic 1-forms. We relate this mapping to the classical Albanese map for the ambient manifold. The study of general properties is supplemented with the description of several important examples.</description>

      <title>Principal $p-$frequency estimates on non-compact manifolds with negative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound for the principal $p-$frequency $\lambda_{1,p}(\Omega)$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in a non-compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n.$ Under the assumption that the Ricci curvature satisfies $\operatorname{Ric} \geq (n-1)K$ with $K&lt;0,$ we prove that $\lambda_{1,p}(\Omega) &gt; \bar{\lambda}_{D,K,n}$, where $D$ is the diameter of $\Omega$ and $\bar{\lambda}_{D,K,n}$ is explicitly defined as the first eigenvalue of an associated one-dimensional ordinary differential equation model that incorporates both $D$ and $K.$ Moreover, the estimate is sharp. This work extends previous results for the case $K=0$ to the geometrically more complex setting of negative Ricci curvature, and providing a new quantitative connection between the eigenvalue, the diameter of domains, and the curvature lower bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent structures often appear in differential geometry, particularly in the study of non-autonomous differential equations on manifolds. One may study the geodesics associated with a time-dependent Riemannian metric by extremizing the corresponding energy functional, but also through the introduction of a more general concept of time-dependent covariant derivative operator. This relies on the examination of connections on the product manifold $\mathbb{R}\times M$. For these time-dependent covariant derivatives we explore the notions of parallel transport, geodesics and torsion. We also define the derivative of a one-parameter family of connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-rigid maps are Riemannian submersions by works of Llarull, Goette--Semmelmann, and the second named author. In this article we show that they are essentially Riemannian products of the base manifold with a Ricci-flat fiber. As an application we obtain a Llarull-type theorem for non-zero degree maps onto products of manifolds of non-negative curvature operator and positive Ricci curvature with some enlargeable manifold. The proof is based on spin geometry for Dirac operators and an analysis connecting Clifford multiplication with the representation theory of the curvature operator.</description>

      <title>A Natural Representation of Volumes Yields a Remarkable Affine Consequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the beginning of the 20th Century there was a growing interest for the investigation of the action of linear groups on the geometry of surfaces. In that context of ideas, the quest for a connection between curvature and the behaviour of linear groups rose naturally. Pursuing the original thought, we investigate how the geometric meaning of this idea is intimately related to the concept of volume of parallelepiped boxes. We show how the ratio of the Gaussian curvature divided by the fourth power of a certain distance of interest in the geometry of surfaces can be represented as a function of volumes. This geometric description explores the profound meaning of a quantity considered by {\c{T}}i{\c{t}}eica in 1907, in a work that sparked a growing interest in affine differential geometry, as an illustration of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, in which the quest for geometric invariants was the main point of inquiry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Weil initiated the investigation of translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies, which include as prime examples Federer's curvature measures. In this paper, we continue this line of research by introducing new tools to study curvature measures. Our main results suggest that the space of curvature measures, which is graded by degree and parity, is highly structured: We conjecture that each graded component has length at most $2$ as a representation of the general linear group, and we prove this in degrees $0$ and $n-2$. Beyond this conjectural picture, our methods yield a characterization of Federer's curvature measures under weaker assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new topological restrictions for complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and RCD(0,n) spaces. Our main results are a Betti number rigidity theorem which answers a question open since work of M.-T. Anderson in 1990, and a vanishing theorem for the simplicial volume generalizing a theorem of M. Gromov from 1982. Combining such results we obtain a new proof of the classification of noncompact 3-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, originally due to G. Liu in 2011, which extends to the synthetic setting.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first show that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T.Lefeuvre (2023). Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or Steklov operator) determines at the boundary both a magnetic potential, up to gauge, and an electric potential, provided the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>

      <title>Approximability for Lagrangian submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a notion of categorical approximability for metric spaces that can be viewed as a categorification of approximability for metric groups, as defined by Turing in 1938. Approximability as introduced here is a property of metric spaces that is more general than precompactness. It is shown that several classes of Lagrangian submanifolds - closed Lagrangian submanifolds in a cotangent disk bundle; equators on the sphere; weakly exact Lagrangians on the torus-endowed with the spectral metric are approximable in this sense. Among other geometric applications, we show that there are such examples of spaces of Lagrangians that are approximable but are not precompact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Inverse Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) for classical fields, specifically focusing on the recovery of parallelly transformed fields within a region based on known boundary data. We introduce a local solution framework, termed "covariant tomography," that uses geometric decomposition to reconstruct interior fields and currents within star-shaped open subsets. The core of our approach involves decomposing differential forms into exact and antiexact components, enabling the formulation of the parallel transport equation via a homotopy operator. We examine three primary extension techniques - radial, heat equation, and harmonic - to map boundary values into the interior, noting that the choice of extension directly influences the regularity of the resulting currents. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to identify the realizability of boundary values and offers solutions for both current and gauge field tomography. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this framework through illustrative examples in low-dimensional spaces and electromagnetic potential reconstruction in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>From multiplicative to additive geometry: Deformation theory and 2D TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory of Poisson deformation of Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson manifolds to Hamiltonian Poisson manifolds that include degenerate cases. More significantly, this theory extends to singular cases arising from symplectic implosion: we introduce a generalized Hamiltonian deformation theory and we show that the imploded cross section of the double $D(G)_\imp$ deforms to the implosion of the cotangent bundle $T^*G_\imp$ with applications to the master moduli space of $G$-flat connections.\\ In parallel, we construct a topological quantum field theory $\N: \text{Cob}_{2}\to \mathbf{QHam}$, where $\mathbf{QHam}$ is the category of quasi-Hamiltonian manifolds. To each cobordism $\Sigma$, we associate a quasi-Hamiltonian space $\N(\Sigma)$ built from the fusion product of copies of the double $D(G).$ We show that these spaces are invariant under the \emph{quiver homotopy} and that the composition of cobordisms corresponds to a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. This provides a multiplicative version of the 2D Hamiltonian TQFT of Maiza-Mayrand.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the first Dirichlet eigenvalue for the $p$-Laplacian in Riemannian manifolds. Firstly, we establish a lower bound for this eigenvalue under the condition that the domain includes a specific function which fulfills certain criteria related to divergence and gradient conditions. In the subsequent section, we introduce an enhanced lower bound for the eigenvalue, which is linked to the distance function defined in the domain. As a practical application, we provide an estimation for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of geodesic balls with large radius in asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifolds.</description>

  In this paper, our focus is on second-order superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential with $n\geq3$. We find that these systems are underpinned by an information-geometric structure, namely the structure of a statistical manifold with torsion.
  We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such systems to extend to non-degenerate systems, i.e. to admit a maximal family of compatible potentials. The condition is geometric: we show that a $(n+1)$-parameter potential is the restriction of a non-degenerate potential if and only if a certain trace-free tensor field vanishes. We interpret this condition as the requirement that a certain affine connection has vectorial torsion.
  We also show that the condition for a system to be extendable is conformally invariant, allowing us to extend our results to second-order conformally superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential.</description>

Abstract: Let $N$ be a Riemannian, Lorentzian or neutral $4$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $L_0$. In this paper, noticing the linearly dependent condition, we obtain characterizations of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and parallel normal vector fields. In addition, we obtain a generic characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and $K\equiv L_0$ which do not admit any parallel normal vector fields. For time-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, we obtain analogous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\eta$-Einstein Sasakian structures on Lie algebras, that is, Sasakian structures whose associated Ricci tensor satisfies an Einstein-like condition. We divide into the cases in which the Lie algebra's centre is non-trivial (and necessarily one-dimensional) and those where it is zero. In the former case we show that any Sasakian structure on a unimodular Lie algebra is $\eta$-Einstein. As for centreless Sasakian Lie algebras, we devise a complete characterisation under certain dimensional assumptions regarding the action of the Reeb vector. Using this result, together with the theory of normal $j$-algebras and modifications of Hermitian Lie algebras, we construct new examples of $\eta$-Einstein Sasakian Lie algebras and solvmanifolds, and provide effective restrictions for their existence.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the classification of almost contact metric manifolds via intrinsic endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1990, D. Chinea and C. Gonzalez gave a classification of almost contact metric manifolds into $2^{12}$ classes, based on the behaviour of the covariant derivative $\nabla^g\Phi$ of the fundamental $2$-form $\Phi$. This large number makes it difficult to deal with this class of manifolds. We propose a new approach to almost contact metric manifolds by introducing two intrinsic endomorphisms $S$ and $h$, which bear their name from the fact that they are, basically, the entities appearing in the intrinsic torsion. We present a new classification scheme for them by providing a simple flowchart based on algebraic conditions involving $S$ and $h$, which then naturally leads to a regrouping of the Chinea-Gonzalez classes, and, in each step, to a further refinement, eventually ending in the single classes. This method allows a more natural exposition and derivation of both known and new results, like a new characterization of almost contact metric manifolds admitting a characteristic connection in terms of intrinsic endomorphisms. We also describe in detail the remarkable (and still very large) subclass of $\mathcal{H}$-parallel almost contact manifolds, defined by the condition $(\nabla^g_X\Phi)(Y,Z)=0$ for all horizontal vector fields, $X,Y,Z\in\mathcal{H}$.</description>

Abstract: Given a Yamaguchi nonrigid parabolic model geometry $(G,P)$ with $G$ simple of real rank at least $3$, we use techniques developed by Erickson to establish the existence of closed, nonflat, essential, regular, normal Cartan geometries modeled on $(G,P)$. Yamaguchi nonrigidity is a necessary condition for admitting nonflat, regular, normal examples. This rules out Lichnerowicz-type conjectures for these model geometries.</description>

Abstract: Catino, Mastrolia, Monticelli, and Rigoli have launched an ambitious program to study known geometric solitons from a unified perspective, which they term Einstein-type manifolds. This framework allows one to treat Ricci solitons, Yamabe solitons, and all of their generalizations simultaneously. Einstein-type manifolds are characterized by four constants $\alpha, \beta, \mu$ and $\rho$. In this paper, we show that when $\alpha = 0$, complete gradient Einstein-type Sasakian manifolds are trivial or isometric to the unit sphere. As a consequence, many geometric solitons on Sasakian manifolds turn out to be trivial or isometric to the unit sphere.</description>

      <title>Full flexibility of isometric immersions of metrics with low H\"older regularity in Poznyak theorem's dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result by Poznyak asserts that any smooth $2$-dimensional Riemannian metric $g$, posed on the closure of a simply connected domain $\omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, has a smooth isometric immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$. Using techniques of convex integration, we prove that for any $2$-dimensional $g\in\mathcal{C}^{r,\beta}$, an isometric immersion of regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\bar\omega,\mathbb{R}^4)$ for any $\alpha&lt;\min\{\frac{r+\beta}{2},1\}$, may be found arbitrarily close to any short immersion. The fact that this result's regularity reaches $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ for $g\in \mathcal{C}^2$, which is referred to as "full flexibility", should be contrasted with: (i) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1/3-}$ achieved by Cao, Hirsch and Inauen for isometric immersions into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and the lack of flexibility (rigidity) of such isometric immersions with regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1, 2/3+}$ proved by Borisov and then by Conti, de Lellis and Szekelyhidi; (ii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ obtained byt K\"allen for isometric immersions into higher codimensional space $\mathbb{R}^{8}$; and (iii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{1}{1+d(d+1)/k}-}$ proved by the author in the general case of $d$-dimensional metrics and $(d+k)$-dimensional immersions for the closely related Monge-Amp\`ere system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework for smooth structures on topological manifolds, replacing coordinate charts with small-scale entropy data of local probability probes. A concise set of axioms identifies admissible coordinate functions and reconstructs a smooth atlas directly from the quadratic entropy response. We prove that this entropy-smooth structure is equivalent to the classical smooth structure, stable under perturbations, and compatible with products, submanifolds, immersions, and diffeomorphisms. This establishes smoothness as an information-theoretic phenomenon and forms the foundational layer of a broader program linking entropy, diffusion, and differential geometry.</description>

Abstract: Gromov conjectured that the total mean curvature of the boundary of a compact Riemannian manifold can be estimated from above by a constant depending only on the boundary metric and on a lower bound for the scalar curvature of the fill-in. We prove Gromov's conjecture if the manifolds are spin and the mean curvature is non-negative. One can also allow $H$ to take negative values, but then the constant depends on a (negative) lower bound for $H$.</description>

      <title>A New Generation of Brain-Computer Interface Based on Riemannian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:1310.8115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the cumulated experience over the past 25 years in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) we can now envision a new generation of BCI. Such BCIs will not require training; instead they will be smartly initialized using remote massive databases and will adapt to the user fast and effectively in the first minute of use. They will be reliable, robust and will maintain good performances within and across sessions. A general classification framework based on recent advances in Riemannian geometry and possessing these characteristics is presented. It applies equally well to BCI based on event-related potentials (ERP), sensorimotor (mu) rhythms and steady-state evoked potential (SSEP). The framework is very simple, both algorithmically and computationally. Due to its simplicity, its ability to learn rapidly (with little training data) and its good across-subject and across-session generalization, this strategy a very good candidate for building a new generation of BCIs, thus we hereby propose it as a benchmark method for the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of adjustment for strict Lie 2-groups and provide the complete cocycle description for non-Abelian gerbes with connections whose structure 2-group is an adjusted 2-group. Most importantly, we depart from the common fake-flat connections and employ adjusted connections. This is an important generalisation that is needed for physical applications especially in the context of supergravity. We give a number of explicit examples; in particular, we lift the spin structure on $S^4$, corresponding to an instanton-anti-instanton pair, to a string structure, a 2-group bundle with connection. We also outline how categorified forms of Bogomolny monopoles known as self-dual strings can be obtained via a Penrose-Ward transform of string bundles over twistor space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factorization structures occur in toric differential and discrete geometry, and can be viewed in multiple ways, e.g., as objects determining substantial classes of explicit toric Sasaki and K\"ahler geometries, as special coordinates on such, or as an apex generalisation of cyclic polytopes featuring a generalised Gale's evenness condition. This article presents a comprehensive study of factorization structures. It establishes their structure theory and introduces their use in the geometry of cones and polytopes. The article explains the construction of polytopes and cones compatible with a given factorization structure, and exemplifies it for product Segre-Veronese and Veronese factorization structures, where the latter case includes cyclic polytopes. Further, it derives the generalised Gale's evenness condition for compatible cones, polytopes and their duals, and explicitly describes faces of these. Factorization structures naturally provide generalised Vandermonde identities, which relate normals of any compatible polytope, and which are used for Veronese factorization structure to find examples of Delzant and rational Delzant compatible polytopes. The article offers a myriad of factorization structure examples, which are later characterised to be precisely factorization structures with decomposable curves, and raises the question if these encompass all factorization structures, i.e., the existence of an indecomposable factorization curve.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>

Abstract: By analogy with Weinstein's neighbourhood theorem, we prove a uniqueness result for symplectic neighbourhoods of a large family of stratified subspaces. This result generalizes existing constructions, e.g., in the search for exotic Lagrangians. Along the way, we prove a strong version of Moser's trick and a (non-symplectic) tubular neighbourhood theorem for these stratified subspaces.</description>

      <title>Classification of curl forces for all space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a decomposition of classical potentials into a conservative (gradient) component and a non-conservative component. The latter generalizes the curl component of the force in the three-dimensional case. The force is transformed into a differential $1$-form, known as the work form. This work form is decomposed into an exact (gradient) component and an antiexact component, which in turn generalizes the curl part of the force. The antiexact component is subsequently decomposed using the Frobenius theorem. This local decomposition is a useful tool for identifying the specific components of classical potentials.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the third Chern form for Griffiths positive vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the positivity of the double mixed discriminant associated with a positive linear map between spaces of third-order complex matrices, thereby settling the three-dimensional case of Finski's open problem. As an application, we obtain the weak positivity of the third Chern form for Griffiths positive vector bundles. Moreover, we show that all Schur forms are weakly positive for Griffiths positive vector bundles of rank three over complex threefolds. This yields a complete affirmative answer, in the case where both the rank and the dimension are three, to the question posed by Griffiths in 1969.</description>
