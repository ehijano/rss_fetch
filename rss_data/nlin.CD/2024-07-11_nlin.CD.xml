      <title>Three-Dimensional Acoustic Turbulence: Weak Versus Strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional acoustic turbulence has been performed for both weak and strong regimes. Within the weak turbulence, we demonstrate the existence of the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum $\propto k^{-3/2}$ not only for weak dispersion but in the non-dispersion (ND) case as well. Such spectra in the $k$-space are accompanied by jets in the form of narrow cones. These distributions are realized due to small nonlinearity compared with both dispersion/diffraction. Increasing pumping in the ND case due to dominant nonlinear effects leads to the formation of shocks. As a result, the acoustic turbulence turns into an ensemble of random shocks with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear vibration and stability of a dielectric elastomer balloon based on a strain-stiffening model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limiting chain extensibility is a characteristic that plays a vital role in the stretching of highly elastic materials. The Gent model has been widely used to capture this behaviour, as it performs very well in fitting stress-stretch data in simple tension, and involves two material parameters only. Recently, Anssari-Benam and Bucchi [Int. J. Non. Linear. Mech. 2021, 128, 103626] introduced a different form of generalised neo-Hookean model, focusing on the molecular structure of elastomers, and showed that their model encompasses all ranges of deformations, performing better than the Gent model in many respects, also with only two parameters. Here we investigate the nonlinear vibration and stability of a dielectric elastomer balloon modelled by that strain energy function. We derive the deformation field in spherical coordinates and the governing equations by the Euler-Lagrange method, assuming that the balloon retains its spherical symmetry as it inflates. We consider in turn that the balloon is under two types of voltages, a pure DC voltage and a DC voltage superimposed on an AC voltage. We analyse the dynamic response of the balloon and identify the influential parameters in the model. We find that the molecular structure of the material, as tracked by the number of segments in a single chain, can control the instability and the pull-in/snap-through critical voltage, as well as chaos and quasi-periodicity. The main result is that balloons made of materials exhibiting early strain-stiffening effects are more stable and less prone to generate chaotic nonlinear vibrations than softer materials, such as those modelled by the neo-Hookean strain-energy density function.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Linearization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Alternative climatic steady states for the Permian-Triassic paleogeography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Chaotic synchronization in adaptive networks of pulse-coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of phase-oscillators are known to exhibit a variety of collective regimes. Here, we show that a simple mean-field model involving two heterogenous populations of pulse-coupled oscillators, exhibits, in the strong-coupling limit, a robust irregular macroscopic dynamics. The resulting, strongly synchronized, regime is sustained by a homeostatic mechanism induced by the shape of the phase-response curve combined with adaptive coupling strength, included to account for energy dissipated by the pulse emission. The proposed setup mimicks a neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</description>

      <title>Graph Permutation Entropy: Extensions to the Continuous Case, A step towards Ordinal Deep Learning, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics play an important role in the analysis of signals. A popular, readily interpretable nonlinear measure is Permutation Entropy. It has recently been extended for the analysis of graph signals, thus providing a framework for non-linear analysis of data sampled on irregular domains. Here, we introduce a continuous version of Permutation Entropy, extend it to the graph domain, and develop a ordinal activation function akin to the one of neural networks. This is a step towards Ordinal Deep Learning, a potentially effective and very recently posited concept. We also formally extend ordinal contrasts to the graph domain. Continuous versions of ordinal contrasts of length 3 are also introduced and their advantage is shown in experiments. We also integrate specific contrasts for the analysis of images and show that it generalizes well to the graph domain allowing a representation of images, represented as graph signals, in a plane similar to the entropy-complexity one. Applications to synthetic data, including fractal patterns and popular non-linear maps, and real-life MRI data show the validity of these novel extensions and potential benefits over the state of the art. By extending very recent concepts related to permutation entropy to the graph domain, we expect to accelerate the development of more graph-based entropy methods to enable nonlinear analysis of a broader kind of data and establishing relationships with emerging ideas in data science.</description>
