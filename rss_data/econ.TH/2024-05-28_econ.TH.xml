      <title>Comparing experiments in discounted problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares statistical experiments in discounted problems, ranging from the simplest ones where the state is fixed and the flow of information exogenous to more complex ones, where the decision-maker controls the flow of information or the state changes over time.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation in Economic Dynamics with a Non-Smooth Fiscal Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of economic growth models that includes the classical Ramsey--Cass--Koopmans capital accumulation model and verify that, under several assumptions, the value function of the model is the unique viscosity solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. Moreover, we discuss a solution method for these models using differential inclusion, where the subdifferential of the value function plays an important role. Next, we present an assumption under which the value function is a classical solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, and show that many economic models satisfy this assumption. In particular, our result still holds in an economic growth model in which the government takes a non-smooth Keynesian policy rule.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanism Design: Robust Pricing, Estimation, and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles challenges in pricing and revenue projections due to consumer uncertainty. We propose a novel data-based approach for firms facing unknown consumer type distributions. Unlike existing methods, we assume firms only observe a finite sample of consumers' types. We introduce \emph{empirically optimal mechanisms}, a simple and intuitive class of sample-based mechanisms with strong finite-sample revenue guarantees. Furthermore, we leverage our results to develop a toolkit for statistical inference on profits. Our approach allows to reliably estimate the profits associated for any particular mechanism, to construct confidence intervals, and to, more generally, conduct valid hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Coherent distributions: Hilbert space approach and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable with the success probability $p$. We are interested in tight bounds on $\mathbb{E}[f(X_1,X_2)]$, where $X_i=\mathbb{E}[X| \mathcal{F}_i]$ and $\mathcal{F}_i$ are some sigma-algebras. This problem is closely related to understanding extreme points of the set of coherent distributions. A distribution on $[0,1]^2$ is called $\textit{coherent}$ if it can be obtained as the joint distribution of $(X_1, X_2)$ for some choice of $\mathcal{F}_i$. By treating random variables as vectors in a Hilbert space, we establish an upper bound for quadratic $f$, characterize $f$ for which this bound is tight, and show that such $f$ result in exposed coherent distributions with arbitrarily large support. As a corollary, we get a tight bound on $\mathrm{cov}\,(X_1,X_2)$ for $p\in [1/3,\,2/3]$. To obtain a tight bound on $\mathrm{cov}\,(X_1,X_2)$ for all $p$, we develop an approach based on linear programming duality. Its generality is illustrated by tight bounds on $\mathbb{E}[|X_1-X_2|^\alpha]$ for any $\alpha&gt;0$ and $p=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Rationalizability, Iterated Dominance, and the Theorems of Radon and Carath\'eodory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game theoretic concepts of rationalizability and iterated dominance are closely related and provide characterizations of each other. Indeed, the equivalence between them implies that in a two player finite game, the remaining set of actions available to players after iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies coincides with the rationalizable actions. I prove a dimensionality result following from these ideas. I show that for two player games, the number of actions available to the opposing player provides a (tight) upper bound on how a player's pure strategies may be strictly dominated by mixed strategies. I provide two different frameworks and interpretations of dominance to prove this result, and in doing so relate it to Radon's Theorem and Carath\'eodory's Theorem from convex geometry. These approaches may be seen as following from point-line duality. A new proof of the classical equivalence between these solution concepts is also given.</description>

      <title>Prudent Price-Responsive Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a flexible demand with a risk-neutral cost-saving objective in response to volatile electricity prices. We introduce the concept of prudent demand, which states that future price uncertainties will affect immediate consumption patterns, despite the price expectations remaining unchanged. We develop a theoretical framework and prove that demand exhibits prudence when the third-order derivative of its utility cost function is positive, and show a prudent demand demonstrates risk-averse behaviors despite the objective being risk-neutral. . Prudent demands exhibit skewness aversion, with increased price skewness elevating the cost associated with prudence. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and conclude their implications for demand response modeling and the future design of incentive-based demand response mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Coupling of Q-Learning Algorithms in Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a simple model of algorithmic collusion in which Q-learning algorithms repeatedly play a prisoner's dilemma and allow players to choose different exploration policies. We characterize behavior of such algorithms with asymmetric policies for extreme values and prove that any Nash equilibrium features some cooperative behavior. We further investigate the dynamics for general profiles of exploration policy by running extensive numerical simulations which indicate symmetry of equilibria, and give insight for their distribution.</description>
