      <title>Numerical modelling of flame spread over thin circular ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical investigation into the phenomenon of flame spread over thin circular ducts in normal gravity and microgravity environments. Flame spread over such geometry is of significant interest due to its relevance in various practical applications, including tubes for flow purpose in medical system, fire safety in spacecrafts, ducts as well as wiring tubes. This study comprises of a comprehensive investigation of key parameters affecting flame spread rate, including fuel radius and opposed flow speed in normal gravity and microgravity environments. A 2-D axisymmetric flame spread model accounted for char and numerical simulations were performed which revealed valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing flame spread over such geometry. The results computed from the numerical model is compared with the experimentally observed flame spread rate to validate the numerical model which can be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. As the radius of circular duct increases the flame spread rate increases both in normal gravity and microgravity environments. The conduction heat feedback and radiation heat gain coming from hot char through gas phase at inner core region are the two major mechanisms which controls the flame spread phenomena over the circular duct fuels. The flame spread rate at different flow ranging from quiescent (0 cm/s) to 30 cm/s is also evaluated and 21 % oxygen and found a non-monotonic increasing decreasing trend of flame spread rate at different opposed flow speed in both normal gravity and microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Oscillating flow around a circular cylindrical post confined between two parallel plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the interest in determining the effect of the micro-anatomy of the spinal subarachnoid space on the cerebrospinal fluid flow and on the associated transport of solutes. To that aim, we focus on a canonical model problem in which a circular post of radius $a$, confined between two parallel plates separated by a distance $2h$, is subjected to an oscillatory flow. In particular, we are concerned with the steady, viscous, time-averaged flow that persists in the vicinity on the cylinder, when the stroke length of the oscillating flow, $U_{\infty}/\omega$ is smaller or comparable to the radius of the post, $a$, where $U_{\infty}$ and $\omega$ are the mean velocity amplitude and the corresponding angular frequency, respectively. First, we analyze the asymptotic limit of small values of the stroke length varying the aspect ratio of the post $\lambda$ and the Womersley number $M$. First-order steady-streaming corrections at leading order have been computed, together with associated Stokes-drift component, the sum of both yielding the mean Lagrangian velocity field. The confinement effect is seen to induce the three-dimensionality of flow. Moreover, in the mid plane the time-averaged steady flow exhibits a recirculating vortex attached to the wall of the post that decreases as $M$ increases for low values of $M$. However, for values of $M$ larger than a critical one, $M_{cr}(\lambda)$, a second, outer vortex is also formed. The dependence $M_{cr}(\lambda)$ has been quantified. The analysis has been corroborated experimentally for a fixed aspect ratio. Consideration of an anharmonic oscillating flow shows the fort-and-aft symmetry of the steady flow is broken. Finally, the analysis is experimentally extended to consider an array of equally spaced posts.</description>

      <title>Covering convection with thermal blankets: formation of supercontinents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continental plates of Earth are known to drift over a geophysical timescale, and their interactions have lead to some of the most spectacular geoformations of our planet while also causing natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. Understanding the dynamics of interacting continental plates is thus significant. In this work, we present a fluid mechanical investigation of the plate motion, interaction, and dynamics. Through numerical experiments, we examine the coupling between a convective fluid and plates floating on top of it. With physical modeling, we show the coupling is both mechanical and thermal, leading to the thermal blanket effect: the floating plate is not only transported by the fluid flow beneath, it also prevents the heat from leaving the fluid, leading to a convective flow that further affects the plate motion. By adding several plates to such a coupled fluid-structure interaction, we also investigate how floating plates interact with each other and show that, under proper conditions, small plates can converge into a supercontinent.</description>

      <title>Inferring parameters and reconstruction of two-dimensional turbulent flows with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems, which means obtaining model parameters from observed data, using conventional computational fluid dynamics solvers is prohibitively expensive. Here we employ machine learning algorithms to overcome the challenge. As an example, we consider a moderately turbulent fluid flow, excited by a stationary force and described by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with linear bottom friction. Given sparse and probably noisy data for the velocity and the general form of the model, we reconstruct the dense velocity and pressure fields in the observation domain, infer the driving force, and determine the unknown fluid viscosity and friction coefficient. Our approach involves training a physics-informed neural network by minimizing the loss function, which penalizes deviations from the provided data and violations of the Navier-Stokes equation. The suggested technique extracts additional information from experimental and numerical observations, potentially enhancing the capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Computing for Scale-up Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Computing is an application-agnostic outer loop framework to strategically deploy simulations and experiments to guide decision making for scale-up analysis. Resources are allocated over successive batches, which makes the allocation adaptive to some objective such as optimization or model training. The framework enables the characterization and management of uncertainties associated with predictive models of complex systems when scale-up questions lead to significant model extrapolation. A key feature of this framework is the ability to explicitly utilize user-specified uncertainty priors, which we call model-specific local trust estimates, that are provided directly together with the problem specification and exploited in adaptive sampling strategies. A multi-fidelity model hierarchy is supported to allow trade-offs in accuracy and data acquisition cost while exploring the search space given a specified budget of potentially distributed, heterogeneous resources. We discuss application of this framework to problems in the renewable energy space, including biofuels production, material synthesis, perovskite crystal growth, and building electrical loads.</description>

      <title>Measurement of nonequilibrium vortex propagation dynamics in a nonlinear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe and measure the nonequilibrium dynamics of optical vortices as a function of propagation distance through a nonlinear medium. The precession of a tilted-core vortex is quantified as is vortex-core sharpening, where the infinite width of a linear core subsequently shrinks and approaches the healing length of this nonlinear optical fluid. Experiments are performed with a variable-length nonlinear medium: a nonlinear fluid in a tank with an output window on a translating tube. This provides control over the distance the light propagates in the fluid and allows for the measurement of the dynamics throughout the entire propagation range. Results are compared to the predictions of a computational simulator to find the equivalent dimensionless nonlinear coefficient.</description>

      <title>Increased solidification delays fragmentation and suppresses rebound of impacting drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splat formed after drop impact on supercooled solid surfaces sticks to it. On the contrary, a sublimating supercooled surface such as dry ice inhibits pinning and therefore efficiently rebounds drops made of a variety of liquids. While rebound is expected at lower impact velocities on dry ice, at higher impact velocities the drop fragments leaving behind a trail of smaller droplets. However, it is not known whether rebound can be entirely suppressed or fragmentation be controlled on such surfaces and if it depends on the extent of solidification inside the drop. In this work, we report on the role played by solidification within drops in modifying the outcomes of their impact on the supercooled ultra-low adhesive surface of sublimating dry ice. We show that the solidification thickness depends on the impact velocity and is the primary driver in suppression of rebound and also promotes a delay in fragmentation. Our findings imply that sublimating supercooled surfaces can present a broad spectrum of outcomes from complete bouncing to no-rebound which are not seen in drop impacts on supercooled superhydrophobic surfaces. We attribute this to thermo-elastocapillarity which considers bending of the solidified layer and is used to demarcate regime boundaries and determine the coefficient of restitution during rebound.</description>

      <title>Analytical structure of the binary collision integral and the ultrarelativistic limit of transport coefficients of an ideal gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the analytical properties of the binary collision integral for a gas of ultrarelativistic particles interacting via a constant cross-section. Starting from a near-equilibrium expansion over a complete basis of irreducible tensors in momentum space we compute the linearized collision matrices analytically. Using these results we then numerically compute all transport-coefficients of relativistic fluid dynamics with various power-counting schemes that are second-order in Knudsen and/or inverse Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we also exactly compute the leading-order contribution with respect to the particle mass to the coefficient of bulk viscosity, the relaxation time, and other second-order transport coefficients of the bulk viscous pressure.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of a cylinder cutting a vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between a vortex and an impacting body which is oriented normally to it is complex due to the interaction of inviscid and viscous three-dimensional mechanisms. To model this process, direct numerical simulations of a thin cylinder intersecting a columnar vortex oriented normally to it are conducted. By varying the impact parameter and the Reynolds number, the two regimes of interaction mentioned in the literature are distinguished: the weak and strong vortex regimes. Low impact parameters, representing strong vortices, led to ejection and interaction of secondary vorticity from the cylinder's boundary layer, while high impact parameters, representing weak vortices, led to approximately inviscid interaction of the cylinder with the primary vortex through deformations. No significant effect of the Reynolds number in the overall phenomenology is found, even if larger Reynolds numbers lead to the formation of increasingly smaller and more intense vortex structures in the parameter range studied. Finally, the hydrodynamic force curves on the cylinder are analyzed, showing that intense forces could be locally generated for some parameter regimes, but that the average force on the cylinder does not substantially deviate from baseline cases where no vortex was present. Our results shed light on the underlying mechanisms of vortex-body interactions and their dependence on various parameters.</description>

Abstract: The present work investigates the evolution of linear perturbations of time-dependent ideal fluid flows with advected quantities, expressed in terms of the second order variations of the action corresponding to a Lagrangian defined on a semidirect product space. This approach is related to Jacobi fields along geodesics and several examples are given explicitly to elucidate our approach. Numerical simulations of the perturbation dynamics are also presented.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of the Spectral Difference scheme for the diffused-interface five equation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work focuses on the generalisation of the Spectral Difference (SD) scheme to the reduced Baer-Nunziato system known as five-equation model for the simulation of two immiscible compressible fluids. This five equation model is considered with the additional Allen-Cahn regularisation to avoid both over-diffusion and over-thinning of the phase field representing the interface. Finally, in order to preserve contact discontinuities, in the reconstruction step of the spectral difference scheme, a change of variables from conservative to primitive is used. This approach is shown to be beneficial in avoiding pressure oscillations at material interfaces. An extensive series of numerical tests are proposed to assess accuracy and robustness of the present method. Both kinematic (Rider-Kothe vortex) and two-phase flow problems (Rayleigh-Taylor instability, shock-droplet interaction, Taylor-Green vortex) are considered.</description>

      <title>A unified SHTC multiphase model of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified nonequilibrium model of continuum mechanics for compressible multiphase flows. The model, which is formulated within the framework of Symmetric Hyperbolic Thermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) equations, can describe the arbitrary number of phases that can be heat-conducting inviscid and viscous fluids, as well as elastoplastic solids. The phases are allowed to have different velocities, pressures, temperatures, and shear stresses, while the material interfaces are treated as diffuse interfaces with the volume fraction playing the role of the interface field. To relate our model to other multiphase approaches, we reformulate the SHTC governing equations in terms of the phase state parameters and put them in the form of Baer-Nunziato-type models. It is the Baer-Nunziato form of the SHTC equations which is then solved numerically using a robust second-order path-conservative MUSCL-Hancock finite volume method on Cartesian meshes. Due to the fact that the obtained governing equations are very challenging, we restrict our numerical examples to a simplified version of the model, focusing on the isentropic limit for three-phase mixtures. To address the stiffness properties of the relaxation source terms present in the model, the implemented scheme incorporates a semi-analytical time integration method specifically designed for the non-linear stiff source terms governing the strain relaxation. The validation process involves a wide range of benchmarks and several applications for compressible multiphase problems. Notably, results are presented for multiphase flows in all the relaxation limit cases of the model, including inviscid and viscous Newtonian fluids, as well as non-linear hyperelastic and elastoplastic solids.</description>
