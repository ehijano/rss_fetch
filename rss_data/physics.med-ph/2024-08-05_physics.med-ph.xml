      <title>Multi-Material Decomposition Using Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a &lt;1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive characterization of tumor therapeutic response with simultaneous mapping cell size, density, and transcytolemmal water exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early assessment of tumor therapeutic response is an important topic in precision medicine to optimize personalized treatment regimens and reduce unnecessary toxicity, cost, and delay. Although diffusion MRI (dMRI) has shown potential to address this need, its predictive accuracy is limited, likely due to its unspecific sensitivity to overall pathological changes. In this work, we propose a new quantitative dMRI-based method dubbed EXCHANGE (MRI of water Exchange, Confined and Hindered diffusion under Arbitrary Gradient waveform Encodings) for simultaneous mapping of cell size, cell density, and transcytolemmal water exchange. Such rich microstructural information comprehensively evaluates tumor pathologies at the cellular level. Validations using numerical simulations and in vitro cell experiments confirmed that the EXCHANGE method can accurately estimate mean cell size, density, and water exchange rate constants. The results from in vivo animal experiments show the potential of EXCHANGE for monitoring tumor treatment response. Finally, the EXCHANGE method was implemented in breast cancer patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, demonstrating its feasibility in assessing tumor therapeutic response in clinics. In summary, a new, quantitative dMRI-based EXCHANGE method was proposed to comprehensively characterize tumor microstructural properties at the cellular level, suggesting a unique means to monitor tumor treatment response in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Modelling power-law ultrasound absorption using a time-fractional, static memory, Fourier pseudo-spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise and implement a numerical method for evaluating a numerical method for modelling the frequency dependent power-law absorption within ultrasound using the first order linear wave equations with a loss taking the form of a fractional time derivative. The (Caputo) fractional time derivative requires the full problem history which is contained within an iterative procedure with the resulting numerical method requiring a static memory at across all time steps without loss of accuracy. The Spatial domain is treated by the Fourier k-space method, with derivatives on a uniform grid. Numerically comparisons are made against a model for the same power-law absorption with loss described by the fractional- Laplacian operator. One advantage of the fractional time derivative over the Fractional Laplacian is the local treatment of the power-law, allowing for a spatially varying frequency power-law.</description>

      <title>A Performance Investigation of Receive Beamforming Schemes in Specular Tissue Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comparison of the delay and sum (DAS), filtered delay multiply and sum (DMAS), minimum variance (MV) and specular receive beamforming schemes in the context of ultrasound imaging of specular reflectors. The main contributions of the study are, 1) a performance comparison of the four receive beamforming schemes through experimental studies for varying angulations of planar reflectors and for reflectors located at varying depths in the medium and, 2)an investigation on the influence of the sub-array length in MV beamforming on the imaging of specular structures. The qualitative conclusions are quantitatively validated in terms of contrast and generalized contrast-to-noise ratios. The study examines the benefits and drawbacks of each receive beamforming technique and highlights the significance of application-tailored beamforming schemes for imaging specular structures.</description>

      <title>Generalized, sublethal damage-based mathematical model for improved prediction of clonogenic survival curve flattening upon hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling can offer valuable insights into the behavior of biological systems upon treatment. Different mathematical models (empirical, semi-empirical, and mechanistic) have been designed to predict the efficacy of either hyperthermia (HT), radiotherapy (RT), or their combination. However, mathematical approaches capable of modeling cell survival from shared general principles for both mono-treatments alone and their co-application are rare. Moreover, some cell cultures show dose-dependent saturation in response to HT or RT, manifesting in survival curve flattenings. An advanced survival model must, therefore, appropriately reflect such behavior. We propose a cell survival model to predict the effect of both treatments based on the general principle of sublethal damage (SLD) accumulation for the induction of cell death and irreversible proliferation arrest. Our approach extends Jung's model on heat-induced cellular inactivation by incorporating dose-dependent recovery rates that delineate changes in SLD restoration. The resulting unified model (Umodel) accurately describes not only HT but also RT survival outcomes, is applicable to simultaneous thermoradiotherapy modeling, and particularly suited to reproduce and predict survival curve flattening phenomena. We demonstrate the Umodel's robust performance (R2 &gt; 0.95) based on numerous clonogenic cell survival data sets from the literature and our experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Generative Models for Multichannel Imaging with an Application to PET/CT Synergistic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multi-branch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>
