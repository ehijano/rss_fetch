      <title>Self-shrinkers with any number of ends in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by stacking $\mathbb{R}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each half-integer $J$ and large enough integer $m$ we construct by PDE gluing methods a self-shrinker $\breve{M}[J,m]$ with $2J+1$ ends and genus $2J(m-1)$. $\breve{M}[J,m]$ resembles the stacking of $2J+1$ levels of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that have been connected by $2Jm$ catenoidal bridges with $m$ bridges connecting each pair of adjacent levels. It observes the symmetry of an $m$-gonal prism (when $J$ is a half integer) or an $m$-gonal antiprism (when $J$ is an integer). The construction is based on the Linearised Doubling (LD) methodology which was first introduced by Kapouleas in the construction of minimal surface doublings of $\mathbb{S}^2_{eq}$ in $\mathbb{S}^3$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of geodesics in conformally compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of geodesics near the boundary of a conformally compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$. In the case where the sectional curvature at infinity is constant (the asymptotically hyperbolic case) it is known that non-trapped geodesics extend to the conformal infinity as smoothly immersed curves in $\overline{X}$ and that the conformal infinity can be locally smoothly parametrized by the initial directions of such non-trapped geodesics starting at a given point. We show that in the general case non-trapped geodesics typically only extend to the conformal infinity with $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity, due to the presence of a logarithmic singularity sourced by the gradient of the limiting sectional curvature. In spite of this singular behavior, we show that the endpoints of such geodesics depend smoothly on the initial conditions, so that the conformal infinity can still be locally smoothly parametrized using the initial velocities of geodesics. In particular, the smooth structure of the conformal infinity is canonically determined by $(X,g)$. We also show how to specify `initial data' for geodesics at the conformal infinity and obtain an asymptotic expansion that parametrizes the geodesics tending toward a given boundary point.</description>

      <title>Infinite graphs satisfying the Bakry-Emery curvature condition CD(0, n): The modified heat equation and applications to geometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G = (V, p, $\mu$) be a (finite or infinite) weighted graph with bounded geometry. Assuming that G satisfies the classical curvaturedimension condition of Bakry-Emery CD(K, n) with K $\ge$ 0 (for the usual Laplacian), we prove that the doubling volume property holds. One of the key points is to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a modified non linear heat equation which replaces the standard one usually used in the case of Riemannian manifolds. Li-Yau and Harnack estimates for the solutions of this modified heat equation are obtained. We also provide explicit examples of Cayley graphs satisfying our assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Fr\"olicher inequality between $L^2$ Betti and $L^2$ Hodge numbers on normal coverings of compact complex manifolds. This is achieved by building an injection using suitable spectral projectors associated to the self adjoint operators $(D_h)^2:=(\overline\partial+\overline\partial^*+h\partial+h\partial^*)^2$ for $h\in[0,1]$. As a by-product, we find a new proof of the classical Fr\"olicher inequality on compact complex manifolds which does not rely at all on spectral sequences.</description>

Abstract: For a general class of cones in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we construct self-expanders of positive genus asymptotic to these cones. As a result, we use these self-expanders to construct a mean curvature flow with genus strictly decreasing but not to zero at the first singular time. We also construct a sequence of self-expanders with unbounded genus which are asymptotic to the same rotationally symmetric cone.</description>

Abstract: We construct new unbounded invariant distances on the universal cover of certain Legendrian isotopy classes. This is the first instance where unboundedness of an invariant distance is obtained without assuming the existence of a positive loop of contactomorphisms. We also show that invariant distances on Legendrian isotopy classes have to be discrete.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the eigenvalues of graph Laplacians on data clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an $\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting $\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon - \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical analysis are relaxed.</description>

      <title>Self-intersecting curves on a pair of pants and periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The character variety $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$ associated to an oriented compact surface $S$ with boundary and a real reductive Lie group $G$ admits a Poisson structure and is foliated by symplectic leaves. When $G$ is a matrix group, any closed curve $c\in\pi_1(S)$ induces a trace function $\mathsf{tr}_c\colon[\rho]\mapsto \mathsf{tr}(\rho(c))$ on $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$. In this article, we study the Hamiltonian flows of trace functions associated to self-intersecting curves. We prove that when $G=\mathsf{PSL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ and $S$ is the pair of pants, every orbit of the Hamiltonian flow of the trace of a figure eight curve on $S$ is periodic and has a unique fixed point. The proof uses explicit computations in Fock-Goncharov coordinates. As an application, we prove a similar statement for the trace of the $\Theta$-web. Finally, we focus on the symplectic leaf corresponding to the unipotent locus, and derive similar results for two more self-intersecting curves: the commutator, and a curve going $k$ times around a boundary component.</description>

      <title>Adapted Renormalized Volume for Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds with Compressible Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalized volume is a smooth function associating to every convex co-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ a real number. When the boundary of $M$ is incompressible, the renormalized volume is always positive, otherwise there are sequences of convex co-compact structures on $M$ whose renormalized volumes diverge to minus infinity.
  We define here a new version of the renormalized volume which adapts to the compressible boundary case, satisfying properties analogous to those of the classical one in the incompressible setting. In particular, the adapted renormalized volume is bounded from below, its differential has uniformly bounded supremum norm, and its gradient has uniformly bounded Weil-Petersson norm. Moreover, it stays at uniformly bounded distance from the convex core volume function. As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the convex core volume of handlebodies in terms of the Weil-Petersson distance from a subset of the Teichm\"uller space. Furthermore, the adapted renormalized volume extends continuously, as a function on the Teichm\"uller space of $\partial\bar M$, to the strata in the boundary of its Weil-Petersson completion corresponding to compressible multicurves. We provide a geometric interpretation of the limit quantity by defining a renormalized volume, and its adapted version, for convex co-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with a finite set of marked points in the boundary.</description>

      <title>Transverse Spheres in Flag Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For some partial flag manifolds of semisimple real Lie groups, including many full flag manifolds, transverse circles are known to be locally maximally transverse. We complete the classification of all partial flag manifolds of split real Lie groups with this property. As a consequence, $\{7\}$-Anosov subgroups of split $E_7$ are virtually free or surface groups.
  On the other hand, using spinors, we find transverse spheres of arbitrarily large dimension in certain full flag manifolds of Cartan-Killing types $A,B,D$. These transverse spheres are verified to be maximally transverse with tools from topological $K$-theory. The aforementioned classification follows from constructions of transverse $m$-spheres, $m \geq 2$, that complement the previously known restrictions as well as the new $E_7$ restriction. Additionally, when $G$ is split of type $G_2, B_3,$ or $D_4$, the full flag manifold admits a fibration by maximally transverse 3-spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory of approximation for holomorphic null curves in the special linear group ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. In particular, we establish Runge, Mergelyan, Mittag-Leffler, and Carleman type theorems for the family of holomorphic null immersions $M\to{\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ from any open Riemann surface $M$. Our results include jet interpolation of Weierstrass type and approximation by embeddings, as well as global conditions on the approximating curves. As application, we show that every open Riemann surface admits a proper holomorphic null embedding into ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, and hence also a proper conformal immersion of constant mean curvature $1$ into hyperbolic 3-space. This settles a problem posed by Alarcon and Forstneric in 2015.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact semisimple Lie group G and a maximal torus T of G, we give an explicit description of all left and Ad(T)-invariant pluriclosed Hermitian structures on G in terms of the corresponding root system. They depend on 2d+1 parameters in the irreducible case, where dim(T)=2d. As applications, we obtain that the only left and Ad(T)-invariant pluriclosed metrics which are also CYT are bi-invariant metrics (i.e., Bismut flat) and study the pluriclosed flow as a neat ODE system.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the interplay between the curvature operator, Weyl curvature, and the Hopf conjecture on compact Riemannian manifolds of even dimension. By decomposing the curvature operator into Hermitian components, we develop eigenvalue criteria for sectional curvature and prove vanishing theorems for Betti numbers under integral bounds on the Weyl tensor. Our results confirm the Hopf conjecture for manifolds with sufficiently small Weyl curvature, including locally conformally flat cases, and provide new rigidity theorems under harmonic Weyl curvature conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between the rigidity of Wasserstein contraction along heat flows and the rigidity of Bakry--\'Emery gradient estimates for Lipschitz functions. Applying results of Ambrosio--Bru\'e--Semola and Han, we show that if an $\rcd$ space with Ricci lower bound $K\in[0,\infty)$ admits two distinct points $x,y$ such that the $2$-Wasserstein distance between the associated heat kernels satisfies
  \[
  W_2(p_t(x,\cdot), p_t(y,\cdot)) = e^{-Kt} d(x,y),
  \] then the space splits off a line.
  Moreover, for weighted smooth manifolds, we provide a direct proof of the rigidity theorem for all curvature bounds $K \in \mathbb{R}$. In particular, we characterize a class of weighted Euclidean spaces as the only spaces where the Wasserstein contraction is sharp for all pairs of points.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Volatility from the P\"oschl-Teller Potential and Hyperbolic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes a formal equivalence between the generalized Black-Scholes equation under a Quadratic Normal Volatility (QNV) specification and the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for a hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential. A sequence of canonical transformations maps the financial pricing operator to a quantum Hamiltonian, revealing the volatility smile as a direct manifestation of diffusion on a hyperbolic manifold whose geometry is classified by the discriminant of the QNV polynomial. We perform a complete spectral analysis of the financial Hamiltonian, deriving its discrete and continuous spectra and constructing the pricing kernel from the resulting eigenfunctions, which are given by classical special functions. This analytical framework, grounded in a gauge-theoretic perspective, furnishes a non-trivial benchmark for derivative pricing and provides a fundamental geometric interpretation of market anomalies.
