      <title>Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Decentralization can hinder frequency synchronization in power grids through multiple phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decarbonization is rapidly increasing the penetration of inverter-based renewables and other low-capacity generators, intensifying concerns about frequency synchronization in increasingly decentralized power grids. A common heuristic from Kuramoto onset theory and homogeneous parameter swing-equation models is that distributing generation across many smaller units reduces the effective heterogeneity of nodal injections (natural frequencies) and lowers the coupling required for synchronization. Here, using a second-order Kuramoto model, we investigate how decentralization affects frequency synchronization when inertia and damping scale with power generation and consumption. We find that decentralization does not always lower the critical frequency synchronization threshold. Instead, increasing decentralization can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the critical coupling strength and lead to a double phase transition in frequency synchronization. These behaviors remain robust under asymmetric inertia between consumers and generators. Even when empirical power-generation and power-consumption distributions are considered, a region in which the critical threshold remains nearly constant is observed as decentralization increases. Our results demonstrate that decentralization can give rise to complex collective dynamics and caution against assuming that decentralization alone ensures improved frequency synchronization.</description>
