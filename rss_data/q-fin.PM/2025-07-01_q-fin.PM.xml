      <title>Deep Hedging to Manage Tail Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending Buehler et al.'s 2019 Deep Hedging paradigm, we innovatively employ deep neural networks to parameterize convex-risk minimization (CVaR/ES) for the portfolio tail-risk hedging problem. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on crisis-era bootstrap market simulators -- customizable with transaction costs, risk budgets, liquidity constraints, and market impact -- our end-to-end framework not only achieves significant one-day 99% CVaR reduction but also yields practical insights into friction-aware strategy adaptation, demonstrating robustness and operational viability in realistic markets.</description>

      <title>Potential Customer Lifetime Value in Financial Institutions: The Usage Of Open Banking Data to Improve CLV Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly adopt customer-centric strategies to enhance profitability and build long-term relationships. While Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a core metric, its calculations often rely solely on single-entity data, missing insights from customer activities across multiple firms. This study introduces the Potential Customer Lifetime Value (PCLV) framework, leveraging Open Banking (OB) data to estimate customer value comprehensively. We predict retention probability and estimate Potential Contribution Margins (PCM) from competitor data, enabling PCLV calculation. Results show that OB data can be used to estimate PCLV per competitor, indicating a potential upside of 21.06% over the Actual CLV. PCLV offers a strategic tool for managers to strengthen competitiveness by leveraging OB data and boost profitability by driving marketing efforts at the individual customer level to increase the Actual CLV.</description>

      <title>Can We Reliably Predict the Fed's Next Move? A Multi-Modal Approach to U.S. Monetary Policy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S. federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies. Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Relative portfolio optimization via a value at risk based constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $n$ agents who invest in a general financial market that is free of arbitrage and complete. The aim of each investor is to maximize her expected utility while ensuring, with a specified probability, that her terminal wealth exceeds a benchmark defined by her competitors' performance. This setup introduces an interdependence between agents, leading to a search for Nash equilibria. In the case of two agents and CRRA utility, we are able to derive all Nash equilibria in terms of terminal wealth. For $n&gt;2$ agents and logarithmic utility we distinguish two cases. In the first case, the probabilities in the constraint are small and we can characterize all Nash equilibria. In the second case, the probabilities are larger and we look for Nash equilibria in a certain set. We also discuss the impact of the competition using some numerical examples. As a by-product, we solve some portfolio optimization problems with probability constraints.</description>
