      <title>Nonnegative tensor train for the multicomponent Smoluchowski equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient implementation of the numerical tensor-train (TT) based algorithm solving the multicomponent coagulation equation preserving the nonnegativeness of solution. Unnatural negative elements in the constructed approximation arise due to the errors of the low-rank decomposition and discretization scheme. In this work, we propose to apply the rank-one corrections in the TT-format proportional to the minimal negative element. Such an element can be found via application of the global optimization methods that can be fully implemented within efficient operations in the tensor train format. We incorporate this trick into the time-integration scheme for the multicomponent coagulation equation and also use it for post-processing of the stationary solution for the problem with the source of particles.</description>

      <title>On some analytic properties of the atmospheric tomography operator: Non-Uniqueness and reconstructability issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the atmospheric tomography operator, which describes the effect of turbulent atmospheric layers on incoming planar wavefronts. Given wavefronts from different guide stars, measured at a telescope, the inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the turbulence above the telescope. We show that the available data is not sufficient to reconstruct the atmosphere uniquely. Additionally, we show that classical regularization methods as Tikhonov regularization or Landweber iteration will always fail to reconstruct a physically meaningful turbulence distribution.</description>

      <title>Learning epidemic trajectories through Kernel Operator Learning: from modelling to optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since infectious pathogens start spreading into a susceptible population, mathematical models can provide policy makers with reliable forecasts and scenario analyses, which can be concretely implemented or solely consulted. In these complex epidemiological scenarios, machine learning architectures can play an important role, since they directly reconstruct data-driven models circumventing the specific modelling choices and the parameter calibration, typical of classical compartmental models. In this work, we discuss the efficacy of Kernel Operator Learning (KOL) to reconstruct population dynamics during epidemic outbreaks, where the transmission rate is ruled by an input strategy. In particular, we introduce two surrogate models, named KOL-m and KOL-$\partial$, which reconstruct in two different ways the evolution of the epidemics. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization performances of the two approaches with different kernels, including the Neural Tangent Kernels, and compare them with a classical neural network model learning method. Employing synthetic but semi-realistic data, we show how the two introduced approaches are suitable for realizing fast and robust forecasts and scenario analyses, and how these approaches are competitive for determining optimal intervention strategies with respect to specific performance measures.</description>

      <title>A numerical view on {\alpha}-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha$ belongs to $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$. The method combines a projection operator with a generalized method of characteristics and an iteration scheme, which is based on enforcing minimal time steps whenever breaking times cluster. Numerical examples illustrate that these minimal time steps increase the efficiency of the algorithm substantially. Moreover, convergence of the wave profile is shown in $C([0, T], L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}))$ for any finite $T \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents of renewal equations: numerical approximation and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for computing the Lyapunov exponents of renewal equations (delay equations of Volterra type), consisting first in applying a discrete QR technique to the associated evolution family suitably posed on a Hilbert state space and second in reducing to finite dimension each evolution operator in the obtained time sequence. The reduction to finite dimension relies on Fourier projection in the state space and on pseudospectral collocation in the forward time step. A rigorous proof of convergence of both the discretized operators and the approximated exponents is provided. A MATLAB implementation is also included for completeness.</description>

      <title>A $\tau$-preconditioner for space fractional diffusion equation with non-separable variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a $\tau$-matrix approximation based preconditioner for the linear systems arising from discretization of unsteady state Riesz space fractional diffusion equation with non-separable variable coefficients. The structure of coefficient matrices of the linear systems is identity plus summation of diagonal-times-multilevel-Toeplitz matrices. In our preconditioning technique, the diagonal matrices are approximated by scalar identity matrices and the Toeplitz matrices are approximated by {\tau}-matrices (a type of matrices diagonalizable by discrete sine transforms). The proposed preconditioner is fast invertible through the fast sine transform (FST) algorithm. Theoretically, we show that the GMRES solver for the preconditioned systems has an optimal convergence rate (a convergence rate independent of discretization stepsizes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first preconditioning method with the optimal convergence rate for the variable-coefficients space fractional diffusion equation. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An accelerated Levin-Clenshaw-Curtis method for the evaluation of highly oscillatory integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient approximation of highly oscillatory integrals plays an important role in a wide range of applications. Whilst traditional quadrature becomes prohibitively expensive in the high-frequency regime, Levin methods provide a way to approximate these integrals in many settings at uniform cost. In this work, we present an accelerated version of Levin methods that can be applied to a wide range of physically important oscillatory integrals, by exploiting the banded action of certain differential operators on a Chebyshev polynomial basis. Our proposed version of the Levin method can be computed essentially in just $\mathcal{O}(\nu\log\nu)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the number of quadrature points and the dependence of the cost on a number of additional parameters is made explicit in the manuscript. This presents a significant speed-up over the direct computation of the Levin method in current state-of-the-art. We outline the construction of this accelerated method for a fairly broad class of integrals and support our theoretical description with a number of illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Mesh Optimization for the Virtual Element Method: How Small Can an Agglomerated Mesh Become?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimization procedure for generic polygonal or polyhedral meshes, tailored for the Virtual Element Method (VEM).
  Once the local quality of the mesh elements is analyzed through a quality indicator specific to the VEM, groups of elements are agglomerated to optimize the global mesh quality.
  The resulting discretization is significantly lighter: we can remove up to 80$\%$ of the mesh elements, based on a user-set parameter, thus reducing the number of faces, edges, and vertices.
  This results in a drastic reduction of the total number of degrees of freedom associated with a discrete problem defined over the mesh with the VEM, in particular, for high-order formulations.
  We show how the VEM convergence rate is preserved in the optimized meshes, and the approximation errors are comparable with those obtained with the original ones.
  We observe that the optimization has a regularization effect over low-quality meshes, removing the most pathological elements.
  This regularization effect is evident in cases where the original meshes cause the VEM to diverge, while the optimized meshes lead to convergence.
  We conclude by showing how the optimization of a real CAD model can be used effectively in the simulation of a time-dependent problem.</description>

      <title>Randomly Pivoted Partial Cholesky: Random How?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding good low rank approximations of symmetric, positive-definite $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. Chen-Epperly-Tropp-Webber showed, among many other things, that the randomly pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm that chooses the $i-$th row with probability proportional to the diagonal entry $A_{ii}$ leads to a universal contraction of the trace norm (the Schatten 1-norm) in expectation for each step. We show that if one chooses the $i-$th row with likelihood proportional to $A_{ii}^2$ one obtains the same result in the Frobenius norm (the Schatten 2-norm). Implications for the greedy pivoting rule and pivot selection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two approaches to constructing isoparametric Virtual Element Methods of arbitrary order for linear elliptic partial differential equations on general two-dimensional domains. The first method approximates the variational problem transformed onto a computational reference domain. The second method computes a virtual domain and uses bespoke polynomial approximation operators to construct a computable method. Both methods are shown to converge optimally, a behaviour confirmed in practice for the solution of problems posed on curved domains.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>High fidelity adaptive mirror simulations with reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design process of large adaptive mirrors numerical simulations represent the first step to evaluate the system design compliance in terms of performance, stability and robustness. For the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes increased system dimensions and bandwidths lead to the need of modeling not only the deformable mirror alone, but also all the system supporting structure or even the full telescope. The capability to perform the simulations with an acceptable amount of time and computational resources is highly dependent on finding appropriate methods to reduce the size of the resulting dynamic models. In this paper we present a framework developed together with the company Microgate to create a reduced order structural model of a large adaptive mirror as a preprocessing step to the control system simulations. The reduced dynamic model is then combined with the remaining system components allowing to simulate the full adaptive mirror in a computationally efficient way. We analyze the feasibility of our reduced models for Microgate's prototype of the adaptive mirror of the Giant Magellan Telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of pricing involved financial derivatives by means of advanced of deep learning techniques. More precisely, we smartly combine several sophisticated neural network-based concepts like differential machine learning, Monte Carlo simulation-like training samples and joint learning to come up with an efficient numerical solution. The application of the latter development represents a novelty in the context of computational finance. We also propose a novel design of interdependent neural networks to price early-exercise products, in this case, Bermudan swaptions. The improvements in efficiency and accuracy provided by the here proposed approach is widely illustrated throughout a range of numerical experiments. Moreover, this novel methodology can be extended to the pricing of other financial derivatives.</description>

      <title>An adaptive linearized alternating direction multiplier method for solving convex optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis proposes an adaptive linearized alternating direction multiplier method to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm by using adaptive techniques to dynamically select the regular term coefficients. The innovation of this method is to utilize the information of the current iteration point to adaptively select the appropriate parameters, thus expanding the selection of the subproblem step size and improving the convergence rate of the algorithm while ensuring convergence.The advantage of this method is that it can improve the convergence rate of the algorithm as much as possible without compromising the convergence. This is very beneficial for the solution of optimization problems because the traditional linearized alternating direction multiplier method has a trade-off in the selection of the regular term coefficients: larger coefficients ensure convergence but tend to lead to small step sizes, while smaller coefficients allow for an increase in the iterative step size but tend to lead to the algorithm's non-convergence. This balance can be better handled by adaptively selecting the parameters, thus improving the efficiency of the algorithm.Overall, the method proposed in this thesis is of great importance in the field of matrix optimization and has a positive effect on improving the convergence speed and efficiency of the algorithm. It is hoped that this adaptive idea can bring new inspiration to the development of the field of matrix optimization and promote the research and application in related fields.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian level-set inversion method for simultaneous reconstruction of absorption and diffusion coefficients in diffuse optical tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian level-set method for simultaneous reconstruction of piecewise constant diffusion and absorption coefficients in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). We show that the Bayesian formulation of the corresponding inverse problem is well-posed and the posterior measure as a solution to the inverse problem satisfies a Lipschitz estimate with respect to the measured data in terms of Hellinger distance. We reduce the problem to a shape-reconstruction problem and use level-set priors for the parameters of interest. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using numerical simulations by performing reconstructions of the original phantom using two reconstruction methods. Posing the inverse problem in a Bayesian paradigm allows us to do statistical inference for the parameters of interest whereby we are able to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructions for both the methods. This illustrates a key advantage of Bayesian methods over traditional algorithms.</description>

Abstract: To our knowledge, the error and perturbation bounds of the general absolute value equations are not discussed. In order to fill in this study gap, in this paper, by introducing a class of absolute value functions, we study the error and perturbation bounds of two types of the general absolute value equations (AVEs): $Ax-B|x|=b$ and $Ax-|Bx|=b$. Some useful error bounds and perturbation bounds of the above two types of absolute value equations are provided. Without limiting the matrix type, some computable estimates for the above upper bounds are given. By applying the absolute value equations, a new approach for some existing perturbation bounds of the linear complementarity problem (LCP) in (SIAM J. Optim., 18 (2007), pp. 1250-1265) is provided. Some numerical examples for the AVEs from the LCP are given to show the feasibility of the perturbation bounds.</description>

      <title>On the linear convergence of additive Schwarz methods for the $p$-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider additive Schwarz methods for boundary value problems involving the $p$-Laplacian. While existing theoretical estimates suggest a sublinear convergence rate for these methods, empirical evidence from numerical experiments demonstrates a linear convergence rate. In this paper, we narrow the gap between these theoretical and empirical results by presenting a novel convergence analysis. Firstly, we present a new convergence theory for additive Schwarz methods written in terms of a quasi-norm. This quasi-norm exhibits behavior akin to the Bregman distance of the convex energy functional associated with the problem. Secondly, we provide a quasi-norm version of the Poincar'{e}--Friedrichs inequality, which plays a crucial role in deriving a quasi-norm stable decomposition for a two-level domain decomposition setting. By utilizing these key elements, we establish the linear convergence.</description>

      <title>Randomized low-rank approximation of parameter-dependent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12761v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the low-rank approximation of a matrix $A(t)$ depending on a parameter $t$ in a compact set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Application areas that give rise to such problems include computational statistics and dynamical systems. Randomized algorithms are an increasingly popular approach for performing low-rank approximation and they usually proceed by multiplying the matrix with random dimension reduction matrices (DRMs). Applying such algorithms directly to $A(t)$ would involve different, independent DRMs for every $t$, which is not only expensive but also leads to inherently non-smooth approximations. In this work, we propose to use constant DRMs, that is, $A(t)$ is multiplied with the same DRM for every $t$. The resulting parameter-dependent extensions of two popular randomized algorithms, the randomized singular value decomposition and the generalized Nystr\"{o}m method, are computationally attractive, especially when $A(t)$ admits an affine linear decomposition with respect to $t$. We perform a probabilistic analysis for both algorithms, deriving bounds on the expected value as well as failure probabilities for the approximation error when using Gaussian random DRMs. Both, the theoretical results and numerical experiments, show that the use of constant DRMs does not impair their effectiveness; our methods reliably return quasi-best low-rank approximations.</description>

      <title>A note on generalized tensor CUR approximation for tensor pairs and tensor triplets based on the tubal product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we briefly present a generalized tensor CUR (GTCUR) approximation for tensor pairs (X,Y) and tensor triplets (X,Y,Z) based on the tubal product (t-product). We use the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (TDEIM) to do these extensions. We show how the TDEIM can be utilized to generalize the classical tensor CUR (TCUR) approximation, which acts only on a single tensor, to jointly compute the TCUR of two and three tensors. This approach can be used to sample relevant lateral/horizontal slices of one data tensor relative to one or two other data tensors. For some special cases, the Generalized TCUR (GTCUR) approximation is reduced to the classical TCUR for both tensor pairs and tensor triplets in a similar fashion as shown for the matrices.</description>

      <title>Fast randomized algorithms for computing the generalized tensor SVD based on the tubal product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with developing two fast randomized algorithms for computing the generalized tensor singular value decomposition (GTSVD) based on the tubal product (t-product). The random projection method is utilized to compute the important actions of the underlying data tensors and use them to get small sketches of the original data tensors, which are easier to be handled. Due to the small size of the sketch tensors, deterministic approaches are applied to them to compute their GTSVDs. Then, from the GTSVD of the small sketch tensors, the GTSVD of the original large-scale data tensors is recovered. Some experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Regularization effect of noise on fully discrete approximation for stochastic reaction-diffusion equation near sharp interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To capture and simulate geometric surface evolutions, one effective approach is based on the phase field methods. Among them, it is important to design and analyze numerical approximations whose error bound depends on the inverse of the diffuse interface thickness (denoted by $\frac 1\epsilon$) polynomially. However, it has been a long-standing problem whether such numerical error bound exists for stochastic phase field equations. In this paper, we utilize the regularization effect of noise to show that near sharp interface limit, there always exists the weak error bound of numerical approximations, which depends on $\frac 1\epsilon$ at most polynomially. To illustrate our strategy, we propose a polynomial taming fully discrete scheme and present novel numerical error bounds under various metrics. Our method of proof could be also extended to a number of other fully numerical approximations for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs).</description>

      <title>Solving Poisson Problems in Polygonal Domains with Singularity Enriched Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful class of numerical solvers for partial differential equations, employing deep neural networks with successful applications across a diverse set of problems. However, their effectiveness is somewhat diminished when addressing issues involving singularities, such as point sources or geometric irregularities, where the approximations they provide often suffer from reduced accuracy due to the limited regularity of the exact solution. In this work, we investigate PINNs for solving Poisson equations in polygonal domains with geometric singularities and mixed boundary conditions. We propose a novel singularity enriched PINN (SEPINN), by explicitly incorporating the singularity behavior of the analytic solution, e.g., corner singularity, mixed boundary condition and edge singularities, into the ansatz space, and present a convergence analysis of the scheme. We present extensive numerical simulations in two and three-dimensions to illustrate the efficiency of the method, and also a comparative study with several existing neural network based approaches.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Obstacle Scattering Problem with Latent Surface Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel iterative numerical method to solve the three-dimensional inverse obstacle scattering problem of recovering the shape of the obstacle from far-field measurements. To address the inherent ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, we advocate the use of a trained latent representation of surfaces as the generative prior. This prior enjoys excellent expressivity within the given class of shapes, and meanwhile, the latent dimensionality is low, which greatly facilitates the computation. Thus, the admissible manifold of surfaces is realistic and the resulting optimization problem is less ill-posed. We employ the shape derivative to evolve the latent surface representation, by minimizing the loss, and we provide a local convergence analysis of a gradient descent type algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. We present several numerical examples, including also backscattered and phaseless data, to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tractability of linear ill-posed problems in Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of tractability for ill-posed operator equations in Hilbert space. For such operator equations the asymptotics of the best possible rate of reconstruction in terms of the underlying noise level is known in many cases. However, the relevant question is, which level of discretization, again driven by the noise level, is required in order to achieve this best possible accuracy. The proposed concept adapts the one from Information-based Complexity.
  Several examples indicate the relevance of this concept in the light of the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Single- and Multi-Goal Error Control and Adaptivity for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reviews goal-oriented a posteriori error control, adaptivity and solver control for finite element approximations to boundary and initial-boundary value problems for stationary and non-stationary partial differential equations, respectively. In particular, coupled field problems with different physics may require simultaneously the accurate evaluation of several quantities of interest, which is achieved with multi-goal oriented error control. Sensitivity measures are obtained by solving an adjoint problem. Error localization is achieved with the help of a partition-of-unity. We also review and extend theoretical results for efficiency and reliability by employing a saturation assumption. The resulting adaptive algorithms allow to balance discretization and non-linear iteration errors, and are demonstrated for four applications: Poisson's problem, non-linear elliptic boundary value problems, stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and regularized parabolic $p$-Laplace initial-boundary value problems. Therein, different finite element discretizations in two different software libraries are utilized, which are partially accompanied with open-source implementations on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

Abstract: Huisken's problem asks whether there is an elastic flow of closed planar curves that is initially contained in the upper half-plane but `migrates' to the lower half-plane at a positive time. Here we consider variants of Huisken's problem for open curves under the natural boundary condition, and construct various migrating elastic flows both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Phase-Field Method for Structural Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an adaptive algorithm for the efficient numerical solution of the minimum compliance problem in topology optimization. The algorithm employs the phase field approximation and continuous density field. The adaptive procedure is driven by two residual type a posteriori error estimators, one for the state variable and the other for the first-order optimality condition of the objective functional. The adaptive algorithm is provably convergent in the sense that the sequence of numerical approximations generated by the adaptive algorithm contains a subsequence convergent to a solution of the continuous first-order optimality system. We provide several numerical simulations to show the distinct features of the algorithm.</description>
