      <title>Calibrated Principal Component Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR) reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components (PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by softening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.</description>

      <title>Signature Kernel Scoring Rule as Spatio-Temporal Diagnostic for Probabilistic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2 models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training, we train sliding window generative neural networks using a predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.</description>

      <title>Extreme Event Aware ($\eta$-) Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or $\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted' extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method. Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and real-world precipitation downscaling problems.</description>

      <title>Topology of Currencies: Persistent Homology for FX Co-movements: A Comparative Clustering Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro). Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering, are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs. classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with potential applications in risk management where understanding structural co-movements is crucial.</description>

      <title>Metadata Extraction Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains, including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review, focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses. Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion, strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.</description>

      <title>On the hardness of RL with Lookahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of $\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Square root Cox's survival analysis by the fittest linear and neural networks model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Cox's proportional hazard models and LASSO in the aim of improving feature selection in survival analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on cross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is directly tuned for feature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square root of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase transition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features, like in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but also by artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Derandomization Framework for Structure Discovery: Applications in Neural Networks and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks (NNs) remains a significant challenge. The work of (Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023) analyzes a multiple index teacher-student setting and shows that a two-layer student attains a low-rank structure in its first-layer weights when trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a strong regularizer. This structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization. Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth, (b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}} \left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT, and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.</description>

      <title>Learning Upper Lower Value Envelopes to Shape Online RL: A Principled Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities, thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.</description>

      <title>Actor-Free Continuous Control via Structurally Maximizable Q-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values, and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning. We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor. Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization. We have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C.</description>

      <title>ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift; (ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning (CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by 15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings. Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for extreme contamination.</description>

      <title>A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large effect sizes ($g&gt;1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75% for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in large language models.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Spectral Fingerprints of Voice Processing in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted ``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption ($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19 other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small, distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations. Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes, indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage to Infinity: Reducing Test Error by Inflating the Minimum Norm Interpolator in Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hastie et al. (2022) found that ridge regularization is essential in high dimensional linear regression $y=\beta^Tx + \epsilon$ with isotropic co-variates $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $n$ samples at fixed $d/n$. However, Hastie et al. (2022) also notes that when the co-variates are anisotropic and $\beta$ is aligned with the top eigenvalues of population covariance, the "situation is qualitatively different." In the present article, we make precise this observation for linear regression with highly anisotropic covariances and diverging $d/n$. We find that simply scaling up (or inflating) the minimum $\ell_2$ norm interpolator by a constant greater than one can improve the generalization error. This is in sharp contrast to traditional regularization/shrinkage prescriptions. Moreover, we use a data-splitting technique to produce consistent estimators that achieve generalization error comparable to that of the optimally inflated minimum-norm interpolator. Our proof relies on apparently novel matching upper and lower bounds for expectations of Gaussian random projections for a general class of anisotropic covariance matrices when $d/n\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Triangular Optimal Transport Maps for Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of estimation errors for a class of optimal transport based algorithms for filtering and data assimilation. Along the way, we extend previous error analyses of Brenier maps to the case of conditional Brenier maps that arise in the context of simulation based inference. We then apply these results in a filtering scenario to analyze the optimal transport filtering algorithm of Al-Jarrah et al. (2024, ICML). An extension of that algorithm along with numerical benchmarks on various non-Gaussian and high-dimensional examples are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness and practical potential.</description>

      <title>Scalable LinUCB: Low-Rank Design Matrix Updates for Recommenders with Large Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank $r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Comparing Uniform Price and Discriminatory Multi-Unit Auctions through Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as $\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively. However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences: uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as $\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand, and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However, most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR) objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption, connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over a baseline policy with high probability.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online Least-squares SGD when $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish \emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees, rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta &gt; 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Information in Interactive Decision Making: A Case Study for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of information in interactive decision making through the lens of a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Focusing on a fundamental example where a unique optimal arm outperforms the rest by a fixed margin, we characterize the optimal success probability and mutual information over time. Our findings reveal distinct growth phases in mutual information -- initially linear, transitioning to quadratic, and finally returning to linear -- highlighting curious behavioral differences between interactive and non-interactive environments. In particular, we show that optimal success probability and mutual information can be decoupled, where achieving optimal learning does not necessarily require maximizing information gain. These findings shed new light on the intricate interplay between information and learning in interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Backward Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of non-stationary Lipschitz bandits, where the number of actions is infinite and the reward function, satisfying a Lipschitz assumption, can change arbitrarily over time. We design an algorithm that adaptively tracks the recently introduced notion of significant shifts, defined by large deviations of the cumulative reward function. To detect such reward changes, our algorithm leverages a hierarchical discretization of the action space. Without requiring any prior knowledge of the non-stationarity, our algorithm achieves a minimax-optimal dynamic regret bound of $\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(\tilde{L}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\tilde{L}$ is the number of significant shifts and $T$ the horizon. This result provides the first optimal guarantee in this setting.</description>

      <title>Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Coverage Principle: How Pre-Training Enables Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross-entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction (more generally, maximum likelihood) implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross-entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.</description>

      <title>From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Sampling Rate Greater than 1.0 May Improve Random Forest Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random forests (RFs) utilize bootstrap sampling to generate individual training sets for each component tree by sampling with replacement, with the sample size typically equal to that of the original training set ($N$). Previous research indicates that drawing fewer than $N$ observations can also yield satisfactory results. The ratio of the number of observations in each bootstrap sample to the total number of training instances is referred to as the bootstrap rate (BR). Sampling more than $N$ observations (BR $&gt;$ 1.0) has been explored only to a limited extent and has generally been considered ineffective. In this paper, we revisit this setup using 36 diverse datasets, evaluating BR values ranging from 1.2 to 5.0. Contrary to previous findings, we show that higher BR values can lead to statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to standard settings (BR $\leq$ 1.0). Furthermore, we analyze how BR affects the leaf structure of decision trees within the RF and investigate factors influencing the optimal BR. Our results indicate that the optimal BR is primarily determined by the characteristics of the data set rather than the RF hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit hierarchical structures in both modes: samples and features. Yet, most existing approaches for hierarchical representation learning consider only one mode at a time. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for jointly learning hierarchical representations of samples and features via Tree-Wasserstein Distance (TWD). Our method alternates between the two data modes. It first constructs a tree for one mode, then computes a TWD for the other mode based on that tree, and finally uses the resulting TWD to build the second mode's tree. By repeatedly alternating through these steps, the method gradually refines both trees and the corresponding TWDs, capturing meaningful hierarchical representations of the data. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our method converges. We show that our method can be integrated into hyperbolic graph convolutional networks as a pre-processing technique, improving performance in link prediction and node classification tasks. In addition, our method outperforms baselines in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning tasks on word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Bayesian estimation of mixture models and argue in favor of fitting the marginal posterior distribution over component assignments directly, rather than Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior on components and parameters as is commonly done. Some previous authors have found the former approach to have slow mixing, but we show that, implemented correctly, it can achieve excellent performance. In particular, we describe a new Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the marginal posterior of a general integrable mixture that makes use of rejection-free sampling from the prior over component assignments to achieve excellent mixing times in typical applications, outperforming standard Gibbs sampling, in some cases by a wide margin. We demonstrate the approach with a selection of applications to Gaussian, Poisson, and categorical models.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between RNA structure and function has recently attracted interest within the deep learning community, a trend expected to intensify as nucleic acid structure models advance. Despite this momentum, the lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</description>

      <title>Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>Rank-One Modified Value Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations, however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and learning problems.</description>

      <title>Decomposing stimulus-specific sensory neural information via diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand sensory coding, we must ask not only how much information neurons encode, but also what that information is about. This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features: a fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Neural Flow Samplers with Locally Equivariant Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalised discrete distributions is a fundamental problem across various domains. While Markov chain Monte Carlo offers a principled approach, it often suffers from slow mixing and poor convergence. In this paper, we propose Discrete Neural Flow Samplers (DNFS), a trainable and efficient framework for discrete sampling. DNFS learns the rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain such that the resulting dynamics satisfy the Kolmogorov equation. As this objective involves the intractable partition function, we then employ control variates to reduce the variance of its Monte Carlo estimation, leading to a coordinate descent learning algorithm. To further facilitate computational efficiency, we propose locally equivaraint Transformer, a novel parameterisation of the rate matrix that significantly improves training efficiency while preserving powerful network expressiveness. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of DNFS in a wide range of applications, including sampling from unnormalised distributions, training discrete energy-based models, and solving combinatorial optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Linear Time Private Hypothesis Selection with the Optimal Approximation Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from its samples is a fundamental problem in statistics. Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in addition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred to as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the underlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha = 3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work, existing upper bounds required quadratic time.</description>

      <title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target miscoverage rate $\alpha &gt; 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in [0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is, $y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight. For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a $\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.</description>

      <title>gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Models on Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.</description>

      <title>FST.ai 2.0: An Explainable AI Ecosystem for Fair, Fast, and Inclusive Decision-Making in Olympic and Paralympic Taekwondo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fair, transparent, and explainable decision-making remains a critical challenge in Olympic and Paralympic combat sports. This paper presents \emph{FST.ai 2.0}, an explainable AI ecosystem designed to support referees, coaches, and athletes in real time during Taekwondo competitions and training. The system integrates {pose-based action recognition} using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), {epistemic uncertainty modeling} through credal sets, and {explainability overlays} for visual decision support. A set of {interactive dashboards} enables human--AI collaboration in referee evaluation, athlete performance analysis, and Para-Taekwondo classification. Beyond automated scoring, FST.ai~2.0 incorporates modules for referee training, fairness monitoring, and policy-level analytics within the World Taekwondo ecosystem. Experimental validation on competition data demonstrates an {85\% reduction in decision review time} and {93\% referee trust} in AI-assisted decisions. The framework thus establishes a transparent and extensible pipeline for trustworthy, data-driven officiating and athlete assessment. By bridging real-time perception, explainable inference, and governance-aware design, FST.ai~2.0 represents a step toward equitable, accountable, and human-aligned AI in sports.</description>
