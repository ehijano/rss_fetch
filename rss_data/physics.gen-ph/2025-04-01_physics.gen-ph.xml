      <title>The Quantum Memory Matrix: A Unified Framework for the Black Hole Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) hypothesis, which addresses the longstanding Black Hole Information Paradox rooted in the apparent conflict between Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). This paradox raises the question of how information is preserved during black hole formation and evaporation, given that Hawking radiation appears to result in information loss, challenging unitarity in quantum mechanics. The QMM hypothesis proposes that space-time itself acts as a dynamic quantum information reservoir, with quantum imprints encoding information about quantum states and interactions directly into the fabric of space-time at the Planck scale. By defining a quantized model of space-time and mechanisms for information encoding and retrieval, QMM aims to conserve information in a manner consistent with unitarity during black hole processes. We develop a mathematical framework that includes space-time quantization, definitions of quantum imprints, and interactions that modify quantum state evolution within this structure. Explicit expressions for the interaction Hamiltonians are provided, demonstrating unitarity preservation in the combined system of quantum fields and the QMM. This hypothesis is compared with existing theories, including the holographic principle, black hole complementarity, and loop quantum gravity, noting its distinctions and examining its limitations. Finally, we discuss observable implications of QMM, suggesting pathways for experimental evaluation, such as potential deviations from thermality in Hawking radiation and their effects on gravitational wave signals. The QMM hypothesis aims to provide a pathway towards resolving the Black Hole Information Paradox while contributing to broader discussions in quantum gravity and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Virial Theorem, Limiting Compactness, and the end state of gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is noteworthy that limiting compactness of a static bounded configuration is characterized by a general principle: \textit{one, by equipartition of mass between inside and outside, and the other by vanishing of energy inside.} The former implies gravitational energy being half of mass leading to limiting compactness $M/R = 4/9$ of Buchdahl star while for the latter, the two are equal giving $M/R = 1/2$ of black hole with horizon. \emph{This is the relativistic Virial theorem respectively for massive and massless particles.} It is remarkable that it prescribes that there can exist only two equilibrium states which also define limiting compactness of the object. Consequently, it leads to a profound prediction that the ultimate endproduct of gravitational collapse could only be one of the two, Buchdahl star or black hole.</description>
