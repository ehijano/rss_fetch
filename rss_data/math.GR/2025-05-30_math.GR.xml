      <title>A canonical Makanin-Razborov diagram and a pseudo topology for sets of tuples in free groups, semigroups, associative algebras and Lie algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JSJ decomposition and the Makanin-Razborov diagram were proved to be essential in studying varieties over free groups, semigroups and associative algebras. In this paper we suggest a unified conceptual approach to the applicability of these structures over all these algebraic categories. With a variety over each of these algebraic categories we naturally associate a set of tuples in a free group. Then we show how to associate a Makanin-Razborov diagram with any set of tuples over a free group. Furthermore, in case the MR diagram that is associated with a set of tuples is single ended, we prove that there is a canonical Makanin-Razborov diagram that can be associated with such a set. This canonical diagram is a main key in studying varieties over free semigroups, associative algebras and Lie algebras, and encodes the global structure of these varieties. It enables us to define a (pseudo) closure of a set of tuples over each of the algebraic objects, associate a rank with it (analogous to Shelah and Lascar ranks), and over free groups the closure provides a canonical envelope that is essential in studying the structure and the properties of definable sets.</description>

      <title>On a question of Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag proved in 2005 that the Hausdorff dimension of a non-trivial normal subgroup of a level-transitive 1-dimensional subgroup of the group of $p$-adic automorphisms $W_p$ is always 1. They further asked whether the same holds replacing 1-dimensional with positive dimensional.
  On the one hand, we provide a negative answer in general by giving counterexamples where the non-trivial normal subgroups are not all 1-dimensional. Furthermore, these counterexamples are pro-$p$ subgroups of $W_p$ with positive Hausdorff dimension in $W_p$ but with non-trivial center, and thus not weakly branch.
  On the other hand, we restrict ourselves to the class of self-similar groups and answer the question of Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag in the positive in this case. Along the way, we generalize a result of Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag on the closed subgroups of $W_p$ being perfect in the sense of Hausdorff dimension to closed subgroups of any iterated wreath product $W_H$ and show that self-similar positive-dimensional subgroups of $W_H$ do not satisfy any group law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe a criterion for groups to have vanishing virtual first Betti number and use it to give infinitely many examples of torsion-free, finitely generated, residually finite groups which aren't virtually diffuse. This answers a question raised by Kionke and Raimbault.</description>

      <title>Volume Entropy Rigidity for Random Groups at Low Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of the volume entropy for weighted word metrics on hyperbolic groups, building on a recent convexity result due to Cantrell-Tanaka. Using ideas from small cancellation theory, we give conditions under which a hyperbolic group admits a unique normalized weight minimizing the entropy. Moreover, we show that these conditions are generic for random groups at small densities, and that the unique minimizer of such a generic group is arbitrarily close to the uniform weight.</description>

      <title>Cell structure of mediangle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genevois introduced and investigated mediangle graphs as a common generalization of median graphs (1-sekeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes) and Coxeter graphs (Cayley graphs of Coxeter groups) and studied groups acting on them. He asked if mediangle graphs can be endowed with the structure of a contractible cell complex. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that (bipartite) mediangle graphs are tope graphs of finitary Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs). We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Skew Spectrum of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings, generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor &amp; Borgwardt (2008). Grounded in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between computational complexity and expressivity. By applying generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.</description>

      <title>Growth of finitely generated subgroups of the topological full groups of inverse semigroups of bounded type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an inverse semigroup $G_0$ of bounded type, we show, along with some other assumptions, that if the set of incompressible elements of $G_0$ is finite, then any finitely generated subgroup $G$ of the topological full group $\mathsf{F}(G_0)$ that is orbit equivalent to $G_0$ has subexponential growth with a bounded power in the exponent.</description>

      <title>Limits over orbit categories of locally finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We correct an error in the paper [BLO3], and take the opportunity to examine in more detail the derived functors of inverse limits over orbit categories of (infinite) locally finite groups. The main results show how to reduce this in many cases to limits over orbit categories of finite groups, but we also look at generalizations of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for higher limits over orbit categories for an extension of locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object in group theory. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer representations of $O_n$. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the odometer lifting and subrepresentations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>
