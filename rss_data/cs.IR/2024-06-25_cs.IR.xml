      <title>FIRST: Faster Improved Listwise Reranking with Single Token Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of information retrieval, particularly for reranking. Listwise LLM rerankers have showcased superior performance and generalizability compared to existing supervised approaches. However, conventional listwise LLM reranking methods lack efficiency as they provide ranking output in the form of a generated ordered sequence of candidate passage identifiers. Further, they are trained with the typical language modeling objective, which treats all ranking errors uniformly--potentially at the cost of misranking highly relevant passages. Addressing these limitations, we introduce FIRST, a novel listwise LLM reranking approach leveraging the output logits of the first generated identifier to directly obtain a ranked ordering of the candidates. Further, we incorporate a learning-to-rank loss during training, prioritizing ranking accuracy for the more relevant passages. Empirical results demonstrate that FIRST accelerates inference by 50% while maintaining a robust ranking performance with gains across the BEIR benchmark. Finally, to illustrate the practical effectiveness of listwise LLM rerankers, we investigate their application in providing relevance feedback for retrievers during inference. Our results show that LLM rerankers can provide a stronger distillation signal compared to cross-encoders, yielding substantial improvements in retriever recall after relevance feedback.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Explanations: Unraveling Recommendations Through Subgraph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in enhancing user experiences across various web applications by analyzing the complicated relationships between users and items. Knowledge graphs(KGs) have been widely used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. However, KGs are known to be noisy and incomplete, which are hard to provide reliable explanations for recommendation results. An explainable recommender system is crucial for the product development and subsequent decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel recommender that synergies Large Language Models (LLMs) and KGs to enhance the recommendation and provide interpretable results. Specifically, we first harness the power of LLMs to augment KG reconstruction. LLMs comprehend and decompose user reviews into new triples that are added into KG. In this way, we can enrich KGs with explainable paths that express user preferences. To enhance the recommendation on augmented KGs, we introduce a novel subgraph reasoning module that effectively measures the importance of nodes and discovers reasoning for recommendation. Finally, these reasoning paths are fed into the LLMs to generate interpretable explanations of the recommendation results. Our approach significantly enhances both the effectiveness and interpretability of recommender systems, especially in cross-selling scenarios where traditional methods falter. The effectiveness of our approach has been rigorously tested on four open real-world datasets, with our methods demonstrating a superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art techniques by an average improvement of 12%. The application of our model in a multinational engineering and technology company cross-selling recommendation system further underscores its practical utility and potential to redefine recommendation practices through improved accuracy and user trust.</description>

      <title>Learning k-Determinantal Point Processes for Personalized Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to personalized recommendation is to predict a personalized ranking on a catalog of items by modeling the user's preferences. There are many personalized ranking approaches for item recommendation from implicit feedback like Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and listwise ranking. Despite these methods have shown performance benefits, there are still limitations affecting recommendation performance. First, none of them directly optimize ranking of sets, causing inadequate exploitation of correlations among multiple items. Second, the diversity aspect of recommendations is insufficiently addressed compared to relevance.
  In this work, we present a new optimization criterion LkP based on set probability comparison for personalized ranking that moves beyond traditional ranking-based methods. It formalizes set-level relevance and diversity ranking comparisons through a Determinantal Point Process (DPP) kernel decomposition. To confer ranking interpretability to the DPP set probabilities and prioritize the practicality of LkP, we condition the standard DPP on the cardinality k of the DPP-distributed set, known as k-DPP, a less-explored extension of DPP. The generic stochastic gradient descent based technique can be directly applied to optimizing models that employ LkP. We implement LkP in the context of both Matrix Factorization (MF) and neural networks approaches, on three real-world datasets, obtaining improved relevance and diversity performances. LkP is broadly applicable, and when applied to existing recommendation models it also yields strong performance improvements, suggesting that LkP holds significant value to the field of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating D-MERIT of Partial-annotation on Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval models are often evaluated on partially-annotated datasets. Each query is mapped to a few relevant texts and the remaining corpus is assumed to be irrelevant. As a result, models that successfully retrieve false negatives are punished in evaluation. Unfortunately, completely annotating all texts for every query is not resource efficient. In this work, we show that using partially-annotated datasets in evaluation can paint a distorted picture. We curate D-MERIT, a passage retrieval evaluation set from Wikipedia, aspiring to contain all relevant passages for each query. Queries describe a group (e.g., ``journals about linguistics'') and relevant passages are evidence that entities belong to the group (e.g., a passage indicating that Language is a journal about linguistics). We show that evaluating on a dataset containing annotations for only a subset of the relevant passages might result in misleading ranking of the retrieval systems and that as more relevant texts are included in the evaluation set, the rankings converge. We propose our dataset as a resource for evaluation and our study as a recommendation for balance between resource-efficiency and reliable evaluation when annotating evaluation sets for text retrieval.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Ensemble Methods for News Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommendation is crucial for facilitating individuals' access to articles, particularly amid the increasingly digital landscape of news consumption. Consequently, extensive research is dedicated to News Recommender Systems (NRS) with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. Despite this sustained scholarly inquiry, there exists a notable research gap regarding the potential synergy achievable by amalgamating these algorithms to yield superior outcomes. This paper endeavours to address this gap by demonstrating how ensemble methods can be used to combine many diverse state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve superior results on the Microsoft News dataset (MIND). Additionally, we identify scenarios where ensemble methods fail to improve results and offer explanations for this occurrence. Our findings demonstrate that a combination of NRS algorithms can outperform individual algorithms, provided that the base learners are sufficiently diverse, with improvements of up to 5\% observed for an ensemble consisting of a content-based BERT approach and the collaborative filtering LSTUR algorithm. Additionally, our results demonstrate the absence of any improvement when combining insufficiently distinct methods. These findings provide insight into successful approaches of ensemble methods in NRS and advocates for the development of better systems through appropriate ensemble solutions.</description>

      <title>SimCE: Simplifying Cross-Entropy Loss for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The learning objective is integral to collaborative filtering systems, where the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss is widely used for learning informative backbones. However, BPR often experiences slow convergence and suboptimal local optima, partially because it only considers one negative item for each positive item, neglecting the potential impacts of other unobserved items. To address this issue, the recently proposed Sampled Softmax Cross-Entropy (SSM) compares one positive sample with multiple negative samples, leading to better performance. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that recommender systems consistently benefit from multiple negative samples during training. Furthermore, we introduce a \underline{Sim}plified Sampled Softmax \underline{C}ross-\underline{E}ntropy Loss (SimCE), which simplifies the SSM using its upper bound. Our validation on 12 benchmark datasets, using both MF and LightGCN backbones, shows that SimCE significantly outperforms both BPR and SSM.</description>

      <title>DemoRank: Selecting Effective Demonstrations for Large Language Models in Ranking Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly apply a demonstration retriever to retrieve demonstrations and use top-$k$ demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL). Although effective, this approach overlooks the dependencies between demonstrations, leading to inferior performance of few-shot ICL in the passage ranking task. In this paper, we formulate the demonstration selection as a \textit{retrieve-then-rerank} process and introduce the DemoRank framework. In this framework, we first use LLM feedback to train a demonstration retriever and construct a novel dependency-aware training samples to train a demonstration reranker to improve few-shot ICL. The construction of such training samples not only considers demonstration dependencies but also performs in an efficient way. Extensive experiments demonstrate DemoRank's effectiveness in in-domain scenarios and strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Our codes are available at~\url{https://github.com/8421BCD/DemoRank}.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Intent-aware Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern online services feature personalized recommendations. A central challenge when providing such recommendations is that the reason why an individual user accesses the service may change from visit to visit or even during an ongoing usage session. To be effective, a recommender system should therefore aim to take the users' probable intent of using the service at a certain point in time into account. In recent years, researchers have thus started to address this challenge by incorporating intent-awareness into recommender systems. Correspondingly, a number of technical approaches were put forward, including diversification techniques, intent prediction models or latent intent modeling approaches. In this paper, we survey and categorize existing approaches to building the next generation of Intent-Aware Recommender Systems (IARS). Based on an analysis of current evaluation practices, we outline open gaps and possible future directions in this area, which in particular include the consideration of additional interaction signals and contextual information to further improve the effectiveness of such systems.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Long-tail Knowledge in Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) exhibits outstanding performance in promoting the knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieved documents related to user queries. However, RAG only focuses on improving the response quality of LLMs via enhancing queries indiscriminately with retrieved information, paying little attention to what type of knowledge LLMs really need to answer original queries more accurately. In this paper, we suggest that long-tail knowledge is crucial for RAG as LLMs have already remembered common world knowledge during large-scale pre-training. Based on our observation, we propose a simple but effective long-tail knowledge detection method for LLMs. Specifically, the novel Generative Expected Calibration Error (GECE) metric is derived to measure the ``long-tailness'' of knowledge based on both statistics and semantics. Hence, we retrieve relevant documents and infuse them into the model for patching knowledge loopholes only when the input query relates to long-tail knowledge. Experiments show that, compared to existing RAG pipelines, our method achieves over 4x speedup in average inference time and consistent performance improvement in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Context-augmented Retrieval: A Novel Framework for Fast Information Retrieval based Response Generation using Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality answers consistently by providing contextual information embedded in the prompt passed to the Large Language Model (LLM) is dependent on the quality of information retrieval. As the corpus of contextual information grows, the answer/inference quality of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering (QA) systems declines. This work solves this problem by combining classical text classification with the Large Language Model (LLM) to enable quick information retrieval from the vector store and ensure the relevancy of retrieved information. For the same, this work proposes a new approach Context Augmented retrieval (CAR), where partitioning of vector database by real-time classification of information flowing into the corpus is done. CAR demonstrates good quality answer generation along with significant reduction in information retrieval and answer generation time.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Transfer of Valence Preferences via a Meta-optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation offers a potential avenue for alleviating data sparsity and cold-start problems. Embedding and mapping, as a classic cross-domain research genre, aims to identify a common mapping function to perform representation transformation between two domains. Nevertheless, previous coarse-grained preference representations, non-personalized mapping functions, and excessive reliance on overlapping users limit their performance, especially in scenarios where overlapping users are sparse. To address aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain approach, namely CVPM. CVPM formalizes cross-domain interest transfer as a hybrid architecture of parametric meta-learning and self-supervised learning, which not only transfers user preferences at a finer level, but also enables signal enhancement with the knowledge of non-overlapping users. Specifically, with deep insights into user preferences and valence preference theory, we believe that there exists significant difference between users' positive preferences and negative behaviors, and thus employ differentiated encoders to learn their distributions. In particular, we further utilize the pre-trained model and item popularity to sample pseudo-interaction items to ensure the integrity of both distributions. To guarantee the personalization of preference transfer, we treat each user's mapping as two parts, the common transformation and the personalized bias, where the network used to generate the personalized bias is output by a meta-learner. Furthermore, in addition to the supervised loss for overlapping users, we design contrastive tasks for non-overlapping users from both group and individual-levels to avoid model skew and enhance the semantics of representations. Exhaustive data analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Star+: A New Multi-Domain Model for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Star+, a novel multi-domain model for click-through rate (CTR) prediction inspired by the Star model. Traditional single-domain approaches and existing multi-task learning techniques face challenges in multi-domain environments due to their inability to capture domain-specific data distributions and complex inter-domain relationships. Star+ addresses these limitations by enhancing the interaction between shared and domain-specific information through various fusion strategies, such as add, adaptive add, concatenation, and gating fusions, to find the optimal balance between domain-specific and shared information. We also investigate the impact of different normalization techniques, including layer normalization, batch normalization, and partition normalization, on the performance of our model. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate that Star+ significantly improves prediction accuracy and efficiency. This work contributes to the advancement of recommendation systems by providing a robust, scalable, and adaptive solution for multi-domain environments.</description>

Abstract: A/B testing is widexly used in the industry to optimize customer facing websites. Many companies employ experimentation specialists to facilitate and improve the process of A/B testing. Here, we present the application of A/B testing to this improvement effort itself, by running experiments on the experimentation process, which we call 'meta-experiments'. We discuss the challenges of this approach using the example of one of our meta-experiments, which helped experimenters to run more sufficiently powered A/B tests. We also point out the benefits of 'dog fooding' for the experimentation specialists when running their own experiments.</description>

      <title>Ragnar\"ok: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Did you try out the new Bing Search? Or maybe you fiddled around with Google AI~Overviews? These might sound familiar because the modern-day search stack has recently evolved to include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. They allow searching and incorporating real-time data into large language models (LLMs) to provide a well-informed, attributed, concise summary in contrast to the traditional search paradigm that relies on displaying a ranked list of documents. Therefore, given these recent advancements, it is crucial to have an arena to build, test, visualize, and systematically evaluate RAG-based search systems. With this in mind, we propose the TREC 2024 RAG Track to foster innovation in evaluating RAG systems. In our work, we lay out the steps we've made towards making this track a reality -- we describe the details of our reusable framework, Ragnar\"ok, explain the curation of the new MS MARCO V2.1 collection choice, release the development topics for the track, and standardize the I/O definitions which assist the end user. Next, using Ragnar\"ok, we identify and provide key industrial baselines such as OpenAI's GPT-4o or Cohere's Command R+. Further, we introduce a web-based user interface for an interactive arena allowing benchmarking pairwise RAG systems by crowdsourcing. We open-source our Ragnar\"ok framework and baselines to achieve a unified standard for future RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Food Pairing Unveiled: Exploring Recipe Creation Dynamics through Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 2000s, renowned chef Heston Blumenthal formulated his "food pairing" hypothesis, positing that if foods share many flavor compounds, then they tend to taste good when eaten together. In 2011, Ahn et al. conducted a study using a dataset of recipes, ingredients, and flavor compounds, finding that, in Western cuisine, ingredients in recipes often share more flavor compounds than expected by chance, indicating a natural tendency towards food pairing. Building upon Ahn's research, our work applies state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques to the dataset, providing a tool that can recommend new foods to add in recipes, retrieve missing ingredients and advise against certain combinations. We create our recommender in two ways, by taking into account ingredients appearances in recipes or shared flavor compounds between foods. While our analysis confirms the existence of food pairing, the recipe-based recommender performs significantly better than the flavor-based one, leading to the conclusion that food pairing is just one of the principles to take into account when creating recipes. Furthermore, and more interestingly, we find that food pairing in data is mostly due to trivial couplings of very similar ingredients, leading to a reconsideration of its current role in recipes, from being an already existing feature to a key to open up new scenarios in gastronomy. Our flavor-based recommender can thus leverage this novel concept and provide a new tool to lead culinary innovation.</description>

Abstract: Information retrieval models that aim to search for the documents relevant to the given query have shown many successes, which have been applied to diverse tasks. However, the query provided by the user is oftentimes very short, which challenges the retrievers to correctly fetch relevant documents. To tackle this, existing studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to the query. Yet, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, though there is plenty of information available to augment it in a relational database. Motivated by this, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with our graph-based set encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios that can incorporate metadata from the relational database, demonstrating that ours significantly enhances overall retrieval performance, compared to existing query augmentation methods.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Optimizing Media Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism is described that addresses the fundamental trade off between media producers who want to increase reach and consumers who provide attention based on the rate of utility received, and where overreach negatively impacts that rate. An optimal solution can be achieved when the media source considers the impact of overreach in a cost function used in determining the optimal distribution of content to maximize individual consumer utility and participation. The result is a Nash equilibrium between producer and consumer that is also Pareto efficient. Comparison with the literature on Recommender systems highlights the advantages of the mechanism.The review suggests advancements over that literature including identifying an optimal content volume for the consumer and improvements for handling multiple objectives A practical algorithm to generate the optimal distribution for each consumer is provided.</description>

      <title>ReLLa: Retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models for Lifelong Sequential Behavior Comprehension in Recommendation</title>

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM). The code is available \url{https://github.com/LaVieEnRose365/ReLLa}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to consider small graphs of concepts and exploit them for expressing graph searches over existing COVID-19-related literature, leveraging the increasing use of graphs to represent and query scientific knowledge and providing a user-friendly search and exploration experience. Methods: We considered the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset corpus and summarized its content by annotating the publications' abstracts using terms selected from the UMLS and the Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease. Then, we built a co-occurrence network that includes all relevant concepts mentioned in the corpus, establishing connections when their mutual information is relevant. A sophisticated graph query engine was built to allow the identification of the best matches of graph queries on the network. It also supports partial matches and suggests potential query completions using shortest paths. Results: We built a large co-occurrence network, consisting of 128,249 entities and 47,198,965 relationships; the GRAPH-SEARCH interface allows users to explore the network by formulating or adapting graph queries; it produces a bibliography of publications, which are globally ranked; and each publication is further associated with the specific parts of the query that it explains, thereby allowing the user to understand each aspect of the matching. Conclusions: Our approach supports the process of query formulation and evidence search upon a large text corpus; it can be reapplied to any scientific domain where documents corpora and curated ontologies are made available.</description>

      <title>ClickPrompt: CTR Models are Strong Prompt Generators for Adapting Language Models to CTR Prediction</title>

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become increasingly indispensable for various Internet applications. Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field categorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the collaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem of semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential of pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input data into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic signals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative information (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the unacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper, we aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for accurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency issue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel model-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models to generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a prompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM has to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the soft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge from ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the prompt interface. Then, we can either tune the CTR model with PLM for superior performance, or solely tune the CTR model without PLM for inference efficiency. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of ClickPrompt compared with existing baselines.</description>

      <title>RecExplainer: Aligning Large Language Models for Explaining Recommendation Models</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used in online services, with embedding-based models being particularly popular due to their expressiveness in representing complex signals. However, these models often function as a black box, making them less transparent and reliable for both users and developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable intelligence in understanding, reasoning, and instruction following. This paper presents the initial exploration of using LLMs as surrogate models to explaining black-box recommender models. The primary concept involves training LLMs to comprehend and emulate the behavior of target recommender models. By leveraging LLMs' own extensive world knowledge and multi-step reasoning abilities, these aligned LLMs can serve as advanced surrogates, capable of reasoning about observations. Moreover, employing natural language as an interface allows for the creation of customizable explanations that can be adapted to individual user preferences. To facilitate an effective alignment, we introduce three methods: behavior alignment, intention alignment, and hybrid alignment. Behavior alignment operates in the language space, representing user preferences and item information as text to mimic the target model's behavior; intention alignment works in the latent space of the recommendation model, using user and item representations to understand the model's behavior; hybrid alignment combines both language and latent spaces. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our approach yields promising results in understanding and mimicking target models, producing high-quality, high-fidelity, and distinct explanations.

      <title>Make Large Language Model a Better Ranker</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across various fields, leading to a paradigm shift in LLM-enhanced Recommender System (RS). Research to date focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms, which are inefficient for LLM-based recommenders due to high computational costs. However, existing list-wise approaches also fall short in ranking tasks due to misalignment between ranking objectives and next-token prediction. Moreover, these LLM-based methods struggle to effectively address the order relation among candidates, particularly given the scale of ratings. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the large language model framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks. Specifically, ALRO employs explicit feedback in a listwise manner by introducing soft lambda loss, a customized adaptation of lambda loss designed for optimizing order relations. This mechanism provides more accurate optimization goals, enhancing the ranking process. Additionally, ALRO incorporates a permutation-sensitive learning mechanism that addresses position bias, a prevalent issue in generative models, without imposing additional computational burdens during inference. Our evaluative studies reveal that ALRO outperforms both existing embedding-based recommendation methods and LLM-based recommendation baselines.</description>

      <title>Spiral of Silence: How is Large Language Model Killing Information Retrieval? -- A Case Study on Open Domain Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practice of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval systems, has become increasingly prevalent. However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital "Spiral of Silence" effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.</description>

      <title>Beyond Collaborative Filtering: A Relook at Task Formulation in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become indispensable in numerous applications, profoundly influencing our everyday experiences. Despite their practical significance, academic research in RecSys often abstracts the formulation of research tasks from real-world contexts, aiming for a clean problem formulation and more generalizable findings. However, it is observed that there is a lack of collective understanding in RecSys academic research. The root of this issue may lie in the simplification of research task definitions, and an overemphasis on modeling the decision outcomes rather than the decision-making process. That is, we often conceptualize RecSys as the task of predicting missing values in a static user-item interaction matrix, rather than predicting a user's decision on the next interaction within a dynamic, changing, and application-specific context. There exists a mismatch between the inputs accessible to a model and the information available to users during their decision-making process, yet the model is tasked to predict users' decisions. While collaborative filtering is effective in learning general preferences from historical records, it is crucial to also consider the dynamic contextual factors in practical settings. Defining research tasks based on application scenarios using domain-specific datasets may lead to more insightful findings. Accordingly, viable solutions and effective evaluations can emerge for different application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Group-aware Search Success</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional measures of search success often overlook the varying information needs of different demographic groups. To address this gap, we introduce a novel metric, named Group-aware Search Success (GA-SS). GA-SS redefines search success to ensure that all demographic groups achieve satisfaction from search outcomes. We introduce a comprehensive mathematical framework to calculate GA-SS, incorporating both static and stochastic ranking policies and integrating user browsing models for a more accurate assessment. In addition, we have proposed Group-aware Most Popular Completion (gMPC) ranking model to account for demographic variances in user intent, aligning more closely with the diverse needs of all user groups. We empirically validate our metric and approach with two real-world datasets: one focusing on query auto-completion and the other on movie recommendations, where the results highlight the impact of stochasticity and the complex interplay among various search success metrics. Our findings advocate for a more inclusive approach in measuring search success, as well as inspiring future investigations into the quality of service of search.</description>

Abstract: In recommendation systems, high-quality user embeddings can capture subtle preferences, enable precise similarity calculations, and adapt to changing preferences over time to maintain relevance. The effectiveness of recommendation systems depends on the quality of user embedding. We propose to asynchronously learn high fidelity user embeddings for billions of users each day from sequence based multimodal user activities through a Transformer-like large scale feature learning module. The async learned user representations embeddings (ALURE) are further converted to user similarity graphs through graph learning and then combined with user realtime activities to retrieval highly related ads candidates for the ads delivery system. Our method shows significant gains in both offline and online experiments.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with incorrect facts owing to outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge editing approaches for LLMs have emerged -- aiming to subtly inject/edit updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from applying knowledge editing to applications. To address these issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be readily applied to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc. Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit, demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub, along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation for beginners to get started. Besides, we present an online system for real-time knowledge editing, and a demo video.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time Autoencoders for Regular and Irregular Time Series Imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series imputation is one of the most fundamental tasks for time series. Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</description>

Abstract: Topic models have been prevalent for decades to discover latent topics and infer topic proportions of documents in an unsupervised fashion. They have been widely used in various applications like text analysis and context recommendation. Recently, the rise of neural networks has facilitated the emergence of a new research field -- Neural Topic Models (NTMs). Different from conventional topic models, NTMs directly optimize parameters without requiring model-specific derivations. This endows NTMs with better scalability and flexibility, resulting in significant research attention and plentiful new methods and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on neural topic models concerning methods, applications, and challenges. Specifically, we systematically organize current NTM methods according to their network structures and introduce the NTMs for various scenarios like short texts and bilingual documents. We also discuss a wide range of popular applications built on NTMs. Finally, we highlight the challenges confronted by NTMs to inspire future research. We accompany this survey with a repository for easier access to the mentioned paper resources: https://github.com/bobxwu/Paper-Neural-Topic-Models.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention and emerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To construct high-quality instruction datasets, many instruction processing approaches have been proposed, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between data quantity and data quality. Nevertheless, due to inconsistencies that persist among various instruction processing methods, there is no standard open-source instruction processing implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from further developing and advancing. To facilitate instruction processing research and development, we present EasyInstruct, an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for LLMs, which modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also considering their combination and interaction. EasyInstruct is publicly released and actively maintained at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct, along with an online demo app and a demo video for quick-start, calling for broader research centered on instruction data and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Conflicts for LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an in-depth analysis of knowledge conflicts for large language models (LLMs), highlighting the complex challenges they encounter when blending contextual and parametric knowledge. Our focus is on three categories of knowledge conflicts: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflict. These conflicts can significantly impact the trustworthiness and performance of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where noise and misinformation are common. By categorizing these conflicts, exploring the causes, examining the behaviors of LLMs under such conflicts, and reviewing available solutions, this survey aims to shed light on strategies for improving the robustness of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.</description>

      <title>Fundus: A Simple-to-Use News Scraper Optimized for High Quality Extractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fundus, a user-friendly news scraper that enables users to obtain millions of high-quality news articles with just a few lines of code. Unlike existing news scrapers, we use manually crafted, bespoke content extractors that are specifically tailored to the formatting guidelines of each supported online newspaper. This allows us to optimize our scraping for quality such that retrieved news articles are textually complete and without HTML artifacts. Further, our framework combines both crawling (retrieving HTML from the web or large web archives) and content extraction into a single pipeline. By providing a unified interface for a predefined collection of newspapers, we aim to make Fundus broadly usable even for non-technical users. This paper gives an overview of the framework, discusses our design choices, and presents a comparative evaluation against other popular news scrapers. Our evaluation shows that Fundus yields significantly higher quality extractions (complete and artifact-free news articles) than prior work. The framework is available on GitHub under https://github.com/flairNLP/fundus and can be simply installed using pip.</description>

      <title>Generation of Asset Administration Shell with Large Language Model Agents: Toward Semantic Interoperability in Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach for achieving semantic interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry 4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications. The prototype implementation and evaluation results are presented on our GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/AASbyLLM.</description>

      <title>LLMs in the Loop: Leveraging Large Language Model Annotations for Active Learning in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resource languages face significant barriers in AI development due to limited linguistic resources and expertise for data labeling, rendering them rare and costly. The scarcity of data and the absence of preexisting tools exacerbate these challenges, especially since these languages may not be adequately represented in various NLP datasets. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the potential of LLMs in the active learning loop for data annotation. Initially, we conduct evaluations to assess inter-annotator agreement and consistency, facilitating the selection of a suitable LLM annotator. The chosen annotator is then integrated into a training loop for a classifier using an active learning paradigm, minimizing the amount of queried data required. Empirical evaluations, notably employing GPT-4-Turbo, demonstrate near-state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced data requirements, as indicated by estimated potential cost savings of at least 42.45 times compared to human annotation. Our proposed solution shows promising potential to substantially reduce both the monetary and computational costs associated with automation in low-resource settings. By bridging the gap between low-resource languages and AI, this approach fosters broader inclusion and shows the potential to enable automation across diverse linguistic landscapes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Margin Loss: Proposal and Application in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems guide users through vast amounts of information by suggesting items based on their predicted preferences. Collaborative filtering-based deep learning techniques have regained popularity due to their simplicity, using only user-item interactions. Typically, these systems consist of three main components: an interaction module, a loss function, and a negative sampling strategy. Initially, researchers focused on enhancing performance by developing complex interaction modules with techniques like multi-layer perceptrons, transformers, or graph neural networks. However, there has been a recent shift toward refining loss functions and negative sampling strategies. This shift has increased interest in contrastive learning, which pulls similar pairs closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart. Contrastive learning involves key practices such as heavy data augmentation, large batch sizes, and hard-negative sampling, but these also bring challenges like high memory demands and under-utilization of some negative samples. The proposed Multi-Margin Loss (MML) addresses these challenges by introducing multiple margins and varying weights for negative samples. MML efficiently utilizes not only the hardest negatives but also other non-trivial negatives, offering a simpler yet effective loss function that outperforms more complex methods, especially when resources are limited. Experiments on two well-known datasets showed MML achieved up to a 20\% performance improvement compared to a baseline contrastive loss function with fewer negative samples.</description>
