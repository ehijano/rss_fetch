      <title>Finite size scaling of survival statistics in metapopulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for detecting therapy-induced resistance from drug screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer therapies induce plasticity, converting initially drug-sensitive cells to a more resistant state, e.g. through epigenetic processes and de-differentiation programs. Understanding the balance between therapeutic anti-tumor effects and induced resistance is critical for identifying treatment strategies. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework, based on multi-type branching process models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cell populations, to detect and quantify therapy-induced resistance phenomena from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data from multiple sources, we demonstrate that our framework is effective for analyzing real-world data and generating meaningful predictions.</description>
