      <title>FlexLLM: Composable HLS Library for Flexible Hybrid LLM Accelerator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FlexLLM, a composable High-Level Synthesis (HLS) library for rapid development of domain-specific LLM accelerators. FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\times$, 6.55$\times$, and 4.13$\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\times$, delivering 1.10$\times$/4.86$\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\times$/6.27$\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline. FlexLLM thus bridges algorithmic innovation in LLM inference and high-performance accelerators with minimal manual effort.</description>

      <title>A Case for Hypergraphs to Model and Map SNNs on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware poses the problem of mapping neurons to cores. SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.</description>

      <title>DUET: Agentic Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve increasingly complex software engineering challenges, but struggle with hardware design tasks. Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.</description>

      <title>SeVeDo: A Heterogeneous Transformer Accelerator for Low-Bit Inference via Hierarchical Group Quantization and SVD-Guided Mixed Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-bit quantization is a promising technique for efficient transformer inference by reducing computational and memory overhead. However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost. Experimental results show that SeVeDo achieves a peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, surpassing conventional designs, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks.</description>

      <title>VLM-CAD: VLM-Optimized Collaborative Agent Design Workflow for Analog Circuit Sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog mixed-signal circuit sizing involves complex trade-offs within high-dimensional design spaces. Existing automatic analog circuit sizing approaches rely solely on netlists, ignoring the circuit schematic, which hinders the cognitive link between the schematic and its performance. Furthermore, the black-box nature of machine learning methods and hallucination risks in large language models fail to provide the necessary ground-truth explainability required for industrial sign-off. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision Language Model-optimized collaborative agent design workflow (VLM-CAD), which analyzes circuits, optimizes DC operating points, performs inference-based sizing, and executes external sizing optimization. We integrate Image2Net to annotate circuit schematics and generate a structured JSON description for precise interpretation by Vision Language Models. Furthermore, we propose an Explainable Trust Region Bayesian Optimization method (ExTuRBO) that employs collaborative warm-start from agent-generated seeds and offers dual-granularity sensitivity analysis for external sizing optimization, supporting a comprehensive final design report. Experiment results on amplifier sizing tasks using 180nm, 90nm, and 45nm Predictive Technology Models demonstrate that VLM-CAD effectively balances power and performance while maintaining physics-based explainability. VLM-CAD meets all specification requirements while maintaining low power consumption in optimizing an amplifier with a complementary input and a class-AB output stage, with a total runtime under 66 minutes across all experiments on two amplifiers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.
