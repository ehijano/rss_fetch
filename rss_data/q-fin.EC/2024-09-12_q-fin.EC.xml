      <title>The Mismeasure of Weather: Using Remotely Sensed Earth Observation Data in Economic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of weather data from remotely sensed Earth observation (EO) data has reduced the cost of including weather variables in econometric models. Weather variables are common instrumental variables used to predict economic outcomes and serve as an input into modelling crop yields for rainfed agriculture. The use of EO data in econometric applications has only recently been met with a critical assessment of the suitability and quality of this data in economics. We quantify the significance and magnitude of the effect of measurement error in EO data in the context of smallholder agricultural productivity. We find that different measurement methods from different EO sources: findings are not robust to the choice of EO dataset and outcomes are not simply affine transformations of one another. This begs caution on the part of researchers using these data and suggests that robustness checks should include testing alternative sources of EO data.</description>

      <title>Un \'indice discreto sensible a la desigualdad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Relative Inequality Index at the Maximum (IDRM), a novel and intuitive measure designed to capture inequality within a population, such as income inequality. The index is based on the idea that individuals experience varying levels of inequality depending on their position within the distribution, particularly with respect to those at the top. The key assumption is that for individuals in lower positions, inequalities referenced to the top positions have greater impact on their well-being and the inequality relative to maximum is the most critical. The IDRM fulfills desirable theoretical properties which were used for its evaluation and comparison against widely accepted measures in inequality literature. From this perspective, the IDRM is shown to be as robust as traditional measures and outperforms the Gini and Dalton indices by satisfying eight out of nine key properties, including decomposability across population subgroups. In a comparative analysis using income data from 58 countries and microdata from Mexico, with the Gini, Theil, and Atkinson indices as benchmarks, the IDRM demonstrates superior consistency, sensitivity to inequality, reduced bias in grouped data, and enhanced precision. This index reflects the varying forms of income distribution, showing heightened sensitivity to the magnitude of inequality.</description>

      <title>Economic impacts of a drastic gas supply shock and short-term mitigation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 entailed the threat of a drastic and sudden reduction of natural gas supply to the European Union. This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of the consequences of a sudden gas supply shock to Austria, one of the most dependent countries on imports of Russian gas. Our analysis comprises (a) a detailed assessment of supply and demand side countermeasures to mitigate the immediate shortfall in Russian gas imports, (b) a mapping of the net reduction in gas supply to industrial sectors to quantify direct economic shocks and expected relative reductions in gross output and (c) the quantification of higher-order economic impacts through using a dynamic out-of-equilibrium input-output model. Our results show that potential economic consequences can range from relatively mild to highly severe, depending on the implementation and success of counteracting mitigation measures. We find that securing alternative gas imports, storage management, and incentivizing fuel switching represent the most important short-term policy levers to mitigate the adverse impacts of a sudden import stop.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of endogenous business cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.06555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Business cycles tend to comove across countries. However, standard models that attribute comovement to propagation of exogenous shocks struggle to generate a level of comovement that is as high as in the data. In this paper, we consider models that produce business cycles endogenously, through some form of non-linear dynamics -- limit cycles or chaos. These models generate stronger comovement, because they combine shock propagation with synchronization of endogenous dynamics. In particular, we study a demand-driven reduced-form model in which business cycles emerge from strategic complementarities within countries, synchronizing their oscillations through international trade linkages. We develop an eigendecomposition that explores the interplay between non-linear dynamics, shock propagation and network structure, and use this theory to understand the mechanisms of synchronization. Next, we calibrate the model to data on 24 countries and show that the empirical level of comovement can only be matched by combining endogenous business cycles with exogenous shocks. Despite the limitations of using a stylized model, our results support the hypothesis that business cycles are at least in part caused by underlying non-linear dynamics.</description>
