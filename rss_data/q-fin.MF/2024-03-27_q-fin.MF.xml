      <title>Growth rate of liquidity provider's wealth in G3Ms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric mean market makers (G3Ms), such as Uniswap and Balancer, represent a widely used class of automated market makers (AMMs). These G3Ms are characterized by the following rule: the reserves of the AMM must maintain the same (weighted) geometric mean before and after each trade. This paper investigates the effects of trading fees on liquidity providers' (LP) profitability in a G3M, as well as the adverse selection faced by LPs due to arbitrage activities involving a reference market. Our work expands the model described in previous studies for G3Ms, integrating transaction fees and continuous-time arbitrage into the analysis. Within this context, we analyze G3M dynamics, characterized by stochastic storage processes, and calculate the growth rate of LP wealth. In particular, our results align with and extend the results concerning the constant product market maker, commonly referred to as Uniswap v2.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions for generic N-token AMM arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex optimisation has provided a mechanism to determine arbitrage trades on automated market markets (AMMs) since almost their inception. Here we outline generic closed-form solutions for $N$-token geometric mean market maker pool arbitrage, that in simulation (with synthetic and historic data) provide better arbitrage opportunities than convex optimisers and is able to capitalise on those opportunities sooner. Furthermore, the intrinsic parallelism of the proposed approach (unlike convex optimisation) offers the ability to scale on GPUs, opening up a new approach to AMM modelling by offering an alternative to numerical-solver-based methods. The lower computational cost of running this new mechanism can also enable on-chain arbitrage bots for multi-asset pools.</description>

      <title>Limited Attention Allocation in a Stochastic Linear Quadratic System with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses limited attention allocation in a stochastic linear quadratic system with multiplicative noise. Our approach enables strategic resource allocation to enhance noise estimation and improve control decisions. We provide analytical optimal control and propose a numerical method for optimal attention allocation. Additionally, we apply our ffndings to dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection, showing effective resource allocation across time periods and factors, providing valuable insights for investors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rebalancing in Dynamic AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic AMM pools, as found in Temporal Function Market Making, rebalance their holdings to a new desired ratio (e.g. moving from being 50-50 between two assets to being 90-10 in favour of one of them) by introducing an arbitrage opportunity that disappears when their holdings are in line with their target. Structuring this arbitrage opportunity reduces to the problem of choosing the sequence of portfolio weights the pool exposes to the market via its trading function. Linear interpolation from start weights to end weights has been used to reduce the cost paid by pools to arbitrageurs to rebalance. Here we obtain the $\textit{optimal}$ interpolation in the limit of small weight changes (which has the downside of requiring a call to a transcendental function) and then obtain a cheap-to-compute approximation to that optimal approach that gives almost the same performance improvement. We then demonstrate this method on a range of market backtests, including simulating pool performance when trading fees are present, finding that the new approximately-optimal method of changing weights gives robust increases in pool performance. For a BTC-ETH-DAI pool from July 2022 to June 2023, the increases of pool P\&amp;L from approximately-optimal weight changes is $\sim25\%$ for a range of different strategies and trading fees.</description>
