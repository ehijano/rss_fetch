      <title>Emblems of pair density waves: dual identity of topological defects and their transport signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pair density wave (PDW) exemplifies intertwined orders in strongly correlated systems. A recent discovery of superconductivity in a quarter-metal state offers the first experimental system where a pure PDW without uniform superconductivity is suspected, offering a unique opportunity to examine the consequences of intertwined orders. A pure two-dimensional PDW supports an unusual fractional excitation as its topological defect (TD). A TD simultaneously winds the phase of the Cooper pair and distorts the amplitude modulation -- a dual role reflecting its intertwined character. As a vortex, a TD carries fractional vorticity of $\frac{1}{3} h/2e$, whose movement would cause resistance. As a crystalline defect, a TD can be sourced by charge disorder in the system. We show that experimentally observed resistive switching can originate from mobile TDs, while a small magnetic field will restore zero resistance by blocking their motion. The resulting resistive state exhibits extreme anisotropy and a Hall response, with the Hall angle determined by the angle between the current and the TD's Burgers vector. These features will serve as confirmation of the dual identity of topological defects as emblems of PDW order.</description>

      <title>Composite Superconducting Orders and Magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same symmetry but with distinct admixtures of individual superconducting order parameters. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</description>

      <title>Vortices in Two-Dimensional Chiral Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital angular momentum (OAM) $L_z$ of two-dimensional chiral $(p_x+ip_y)^{\nu}$-wave superfluids (SFs) in the presence of an axisymmetric multiply quantized vortex (MQV) with vorticity $k$ on a disk at zero temperature, in the framework of Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory. Focusing on spectral asymmetry (or spectral flow), we find that $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ for any integer $\nu$ and $k$ in the Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) regime, where $N$ is the total number of fermions. While in the weak-pairing Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime, only for chiral $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=\pm 1$, $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ still holds. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ or $|k|\ge2$ in the BCS regime, the OAM $L_z$ is remarkably reduced from its ``full" value in the BEC regime. However, the deviations differ in these two cases. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$, $L_z$ is sharply suppressed in this ideal setting with a specular wall, while the suppression caused by the $|k| \ge 2$ vortex is moderate, which is core-size dependent. Furthermore, for $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=-1$, the total OAM $L_z$ is zero, but the distribution $L_z(r)$ is nontrivial compared with that of vortex-free $s$-wave SF, in which the total OAM is zero as well. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ and $|k|\ge2$, the effects of circulation due to vortex and chiral pairing can coexist, and hence depress the OAM simultaneously. These observations can be explained by spectral asymmetry and unpaired fermions in the ground state of the BdG Hamiltonian. We also investigate the spatial distribution of particle density, OAM, by solving the BdG equation.</description>

      <title>Observation of Uniform Supercurrent Flow in Polycrystalline K-doped Ba122 by Combined Magneto-optical Imaging and Finite-element Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic current uniformity in a (Ba,K)Fe2As2 bulk sample produced by a process that demonstrated high trapped magnetic fields was evaluated through a comparative experimental and modeling approach. The bulk sample, with a well-defined square geometry, exhibited ideal roof-top patterns in magneto-optical (MO) images. Comparison of the magnetic moment, MO images, and finite element modeling results showed good agreement for the critical current density, suggesting that the supercurrent circulates uniformly throughout the sample on the order of MO resolution. These results highlight the importance of enhancing flux pinning strength and microstructural control at the submicron and grain boundary scale in iron-based superconducting polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting gap in the outer CuO$_2$ plane of the trilayer cuprate (Hg,Re)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of a momentum-resolved superconducting gap in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate, which holds the highest record of superconducting transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) at ambient pressure. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy utilizing a micro-focused beam, clear quasiparticle dispersions originating from the inner and outer CuO$_2$ planes (IP and OP, respectively) were separately identified. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for the IP was comparable to that of the Bi-based trilayer cuprate with a lower $T_\mathrm{c}$. In contrast, the superconducting gap for the OP was significantly larger than that of the Bi-based one. While strong pairing in the IP has been highlighted as the key element of trilayer cuprates, the present results suggest that the enhanced pairing energy in the OP is essential for the highest $T_\mathrm{c}$ at ambient pressure realized in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate.</description>

      <title>Identifying vortex lattice in type-II superconductors via the dynamic magnetostrictive effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed-state physics, where magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1 in the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These vortices form a two-dimensional lattice which persists up to another irreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The vortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of type-II superconductors, a third definitive criterion-beyond resistivity and magnetization-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the superconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due to the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin piezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into an in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice across several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid phase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper critical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to enhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an unexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a fundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference {\phi} between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2{\pi} periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\pi} periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2{\pi} and 4{\pi} periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2{\pi} or 4{\pi} periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the N\'eel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.</description>

      <title>Exciton condensation from level repulsion: application to bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted but remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.</description>

      <title>Giant transverse magnetic fluctuations at the edge of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UTe$_{2}$ exhibits the remarkable phenomenon of re-entrant superconductivity, whereby the zero-resistance state reappears above 40 tesla after being suppressed with a field of around 10 tesla. One potential pairing mechanism, invoked in the related re-entrant superconductors UCoGe and URhGe, involves transverse fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter. However, the requisite ferromagnetic order - present in both UCoGe and URhGe - is absent in UTe$_{2}$, and magnetization measurements show no sign of strong fluctuations. Here, we measure the magnetotropic susceptibility of UTe$_{2}$ across two field-angle planes. This quantity is sensitive to the magnetic susceptibility in a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field - a quantity that is not accessed in conventional magnetization measurements. We observe a very large decrease in the magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of field orientations, indicating a large increase in the transverse magnetic susceptibility. The three superconducting phases of UTe$_{2}$, including the high-field re-entrant phase, surround this region of enhanced susceptibility in the field-angle phase diagram. The strongest transverse susceptibility is found near the critical end point of the high-field metamagnetic transition, suggesting that quantum critical fluctuations of a field-induced magnetic order parameter may be responsible for the large transverse susceptibility, and may provide a pairing mechanism for field-induced superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric bulk NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ising superconductivity allows in-plane upper critical magnetic fields to vastly surpass Pauli limit by locking the antiparallel electron spins of Cooper pairs in the out-of-plane direction. It was first explicitly demonstrated in fully two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with large spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Since then, several studies have shown that it can be present in layered bulk materials, too. In our previous study, we have clarified the underlying microscopic mechanism of Ising superconductivity in bulk, based on a reduced electronic coupling between superconducting layers due to intercalation by insulating layers and restricted inversion symmetry. But earlier studies suggest that in some transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes Pauli paramagnetic limit is violated even without intercalation. Here, using heat capacity measurements we unambiguously demonstrate, that the pristine noncentrosymmetric bulk 4Ha-NbSe2 polytype significantly violates the Pauli limit. The band structure parameters obtained from ab initio calculations using the experimentally determined crystal structure are used in the theoretical model which provides the microscopic mechanism of the Ising protection based solely on broken inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Two-step phase transitions in Fe(Se,Te)</title>

Abstract: In the studied crystals of FeSe0.7 Te0.3 , a structural phase transition occurs in two stages. At higher temperatures, the electronic subsystem undergoes a reconstruction, leading to a significant increase in elastoresistance. 77 Se NMR data show an abrupt change in the relaxation rate during this transition. The final transition occurs at a temperature several degrees below and is also accompanied by anomalies in the electronic properties. Thus, in the Fe(Se,Te) series, similarly to the behavior of pure FeSe under pressure, the type of transition changes and intermediate state appear before the structural transition is suppressed. This similarity between the corresponding phase diagrams is explained by the same deformation of the iron coordination environment in Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in FeSe under pressure. Our findings provide new and significant information on the phase diagram of Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in particular suggest the possible existence of a triple point near the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gor'kov-Hedin Equations for Quantum Many-Body Systems with Spin-Dependent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gor'kov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.</description>
