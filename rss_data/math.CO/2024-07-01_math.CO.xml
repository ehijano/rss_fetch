      <title>Almost Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Search Three Ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal arrays play a fundamental role in many applications. However, constructing orthogonal arrays with the required parameters for an application usually is extremely difficult and, sometimes, even impossible. Hence there is an increasing need for a relaxation of orthogonal arrays to allow a wider flexibility. The latter has lead to various types of arrays under the name of ``nearly-orthogonal arrays'', and less often ``almost orthogonal arrays''. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we review all the existing relaxations, comparing and discussing them in depth. On the other hand, we explore how to find almost orthogonal arrays three ways: using integer programming, local search meta-heuristics and algebraic methods. We compare all our search results with the ones existing in the literature, and we show that they are competitive, improving some of the existing arrays for many non-orthogonality measures. All our found almost orthogonal arrays are available at a public repository.</description>

      <title>Equi-isoclinic subspaces from symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a flexible technique that constructs tight fusion frames with prescribed transitive symmetry. Applying this technique with representations of the symmetric and alternating groups, we obtain several new infinite families of equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames, each with the remarkable property that its automorphism group is either $S_n$ or $A_n$. These ensembles are optimal packings for Grassmannian space equipped with spectral distance, and as such, they find applications in block compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>The Pinnacle Sets of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the pinnacle sets of a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. Given a bijective vertex labeling $\lambda\,:\,V(G)\rightarrow [n]$, the label $\lambda(v)$ of vertex $v$ is a pinnacle of $(G, \lambda)$ if $\lambda(v)&gt;\lambda(w)$ for all vertices $w$ in the neighborhood of $v$. The pinnacle set of $(G, \lambda)$ contains all the pinnacles of the labeled graph. A subset $S\subseteq[n]$ is a pinnacle set of $G$ if there exists a labeling $\lambda$ such that $S$ is the pinnacle set of $(G,\lambda)$. Of interest to us is the question: Which subsets of $[n]$ are the pinnacle sets of $G$? Our main results are as follows. We show that when $G$ is connected, $G$ has a size-$k$ pinnacle set if and only if $G$ has an independent set of the same size. Consequently, determining if $G$ has a size-$k$ pinnacle set and determining if $G$ has a particular subset $S$ as a pinnacle set are NP-complete problems. Nonetheless, we completely identify all the pinnacle sets of complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, cycles and paths. We also present two techniques for deriving new pinnacle sets from old ones that imply a typical graph has many pinnacle sets. Finally, we define a poset on all the size-$k$ pinnacle sets of $G$ and show that it is a join semilattice. If, additionally, the poset has a minimum element, then it is a distributive lattice. We conclude with some open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>The Planar Tur\'an Number of $\Theta_6$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two particular $\Theta_6$-graphs - the 6-cycle graphs with a diagonal. We find the planar Tur\'an number of each of them, i.e. the maximum number of edges in a planar graph $G$ of $n$ vertices not containing the given $\Theta_6$ as a subgraph and we find infinitely many extremal constructions showing the sharpness of these results - apart from a small additive constant error in one of the cases.</description>

      <title>Chow rings and augmented Chow rings of uniform matroids and their $q$-analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the natural representations of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the (augmented) Chow rings of uniform matroids and $q$-uniform matroids. The Frobenius series for uniform matroids and their $q$-analogs are computed. As a byproduct, we recover Hameister, Rao, and Simpson's formula of Hilbert series of Chow rings of $q$-uniform matroids in terms of permutations and further obtain their augmented counterpart in terms of decorated permutations.
  We also show that equivariant Charney-Davis quantities of (augmented) Chow rings of general matroids are nonnegative (i.e. genuine representations of the automorphism group of the matroid). When the matroid is a uniform matroid, the representations either vanish or are Specht modules of some skew hook shapes. When descending to the usual Charney-Davis quantities, we obtain an elegant combinatorial interpretation of Hameister, Rao, and Simpson's formula for Chow rings of $q$-uniform matroids and its augmented counterpart.</description>

      <title>A Note on Ordinally Concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of ordinal concavity of utility functions has recently been considered by Hafalir, Kojima, Yenmez, and Yokote in economics while there exist earlier related works in discrete optimization and operations research. In the present note we consider functions satisfying ordinal concavity and introduce a weaker notion of ordinal weak-concavity as well. We also investigate useful behaviors of ordinally (weak-)concave functions and related choice correspondences, show a characterization of ordinally weak-concave functions, and give an efficient algorithm for maximizing ordinally concave functions. We further examine a duality in ordinally (weak-)concave functions and introduce the lexicographic composition of ordinally weak-concave functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal radio labeling for the Cartesian product of square mesh networks and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the most critical component in the communication process, channels have a great impact on the communication quality of network. With the continuous expansion of network scale, the limited channel resources lead to the limitation of communication network scale. Therefore, achieving reasonable channel assignment and utilization becomes an extremely challenging problem. In order to solve this issue effectively, the channel assignment problem in communication networks can be transformed into a graph labeling problem, utilizing graphs to simulate the communication networks. In this paper, the topologies of mesh networks and stars are studied by constructing Cartesian product, and the lower bound and exact value of the optimal radio label of the Cartesian product of square mesh network and star $G=P(m,m)\Box K_{1,n}$ are obtained, where $m\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric $(15,8,4)$-designs in terms of the geometry of binary simplex codes of dimension $4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n=2^k-1$ and $m=2^{k-2}$ for a certain $k\ge 3$. Consider the point-line geometry of $2m$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. Maximal singular subspaces of this geometry correspond to binary simplex codes of dimension $k$. For $k\ge 4$ the associated collinearity graph contains maximal cliques different from maximal singular subspaces. We investigate maximal cliques corresponding to symmetric $(n,2m,m)$-designs. The main results concern the case $k=4$ and give a geometric interpretation of the five well-known symmetric $(15,8,4)$-designs.</description>

      <title>A conjectural basis for the $(1,2)$-bosonic-fermionic coinvariant ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first conjectural construction of a monomial basis for the coinvariant ring $R_n^{(1,2)}$, for the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on one set of bosonic (commuting) and two sets of fermionic (anticommuting) variables. Our construction interpolates between the modified Motzkin path basis for $R_n^{(0,2)}$ of Kim-Rhoades (2022) and the super-Artin basis for $R_n^{(1,1)}$ conjectured by Sagan-Swanson (2024) and proven by Angarone et al. (2024). We prove that our proposed basis has cardinality $2^{n-1}n!$, aligning with a conjecture of Zabrocki (2020) on the dimension of $R_n^{(1,2)}$, and show how it gives a combinatorial expression for the Hilbert series. We also conjecture a Frobenius series for $R_n^{(1,2)}$. We show that these proposed Hilbert and Frobenius series are equivalent to conjectures of Iraci, Nadeau, and Vanden Wyngaerd (2023) on $R_n^{(1,2)}$ in terms of segmented Smirnov words, by exhibiting a weight-preserving bijection between our proposed basis and their segmented permutations. We extend some of their results on the sign character to hook characters, and give a formula for the $m_\mu$ coefficients of the conjectural Frobenius series. Finally, we conjecture a monomial basis for the analogous ring in type $B_n$, and show that it has cardinality $4^nn!$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first investigate the partitions whose parts are congruent to $a$ or $b$ modulo $k$ with the aid of separable integer partition classes with modulus $k$ introduced by Andrews. Then, we introduce the $(k,r)$-overpartitions in which only parts equivalent to $r$ modulo $k$ may be overlined and we will show that the number of $(k,k)$-overpartitions of $n$ equals the number of partitions of $n$ such that the $k$-th occurrence of a part may be overlined. Finally, we extend separable integer partition classes with modulus $k$ to overpartitions and then give the generating function for $(k,r)$-modulo overpartitions, which are the $(k,r)$-overpartitions satisfying certain congruence conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds for zero-sum cycles. I. Odd order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite (not necessarily Abelian) group $(\Gamma,\cdot)$, let $n(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{N}$ denote the smallest positive integer $n$ such that for every labelling of the arcs of the complete digraph of order $n$ using elements from $\Gamma$, there exists a directed cycle such that the arc-labels along the cycle multiply to the identity. Alon and Krivelevich initiated the study of the parameter $n(\cdot)$ on cyclic groups and proved $n(\mathbb{Z}_q)=O(q \log q)$. This was later improved to a linear bound of $n(\Gamma)\le 8|\Gamma|$ for every finite Abelian group by M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and the last author, and then further to $n(\Gamma)\le 2|\Gamma|-1$ for every non-trivial finite group independently by Berendsohn, Boyadzhiyska and Kozma as well as by Akrami, Alon, Chaudhury, Garg, Mehlhorn and Mehta.
  In this series of two papers we conclude this line of research by proving that $n(\Gamma)\le |\Gamma|+1$ for every finite group $(\Gamma,\cdot)$, which is the best possible such bound in terms of the group order and precisely determines the value of $n(\Gamma)$ for all cyclic groups as $n(\mathbb{Z}_q)=q+1$.
  In the present paper we prove the above result for all groups of odd order. The proof for groups of even order needs to overcome substantial additional obstacles and will be presented in the second part of this series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Latin square is an $n$ by $n$ grid filled with $n$ symbols so that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and each column. A transversal in a Latin square is a collection of cells which do not share any row, column, or symbol. This survey will focus on results from the last decade which have continued the long history of the study of transversals in Latin squares.</description>

      <title>Alon's transmitting problem and multicolor Beck--Spencer Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,q\}^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon proved that for any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lceil\frac n2\rceil$ vertices of $H(n,2)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$. In this note, we prove that for any $q\geq 3$ and any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lfloor(1-\frac1q)n\rfloor$ vertices of $H(n,q)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$.
  Alon used the Beck--Spencer Lemma which, in turn, was based on the floating variable method introduced by Beck and Fiala who studied combinatorial discrepancies. For our proof, we extend the Beck--Spencer Lemma by using a multicolor version of the floating variable method due to Doerr and Srivastav.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig (KL) and $Z$-polynomials of matroids. We formulate an equivariant generalization of a result by Braden and Vysogorets that relates the equivariant KL and $Z$-polynomials of a matroid with those of a single-element deletion. We also discuss the failure of equivariant $\gamma$-positivity for the $Z$-polynomial. As an application of our main result, we obtain a formula for the equivariant KL polynomial of the graphic matroid gotten by gluing two cycles. Furthermore, we compute the equivariant KL polynomials of all matroids of corank~$2$ via valuations. This provides an application of the machinery of Elias, Miyata, Proudfoot, and Vecchi to corank $2$ matroids, and it extends results of Ferroni and Schr\"oter.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Graceful Coloring in a Specific r-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graceful $l$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper vertex coloring with $l$ colors which induces a proper edge coloring with at most $l-1$ colors, where the color for an edge $ab$ is the absolute difference between the colors assigned to the vertices $a$ and $b$. The graceful chromatic number $\chi_g(G)$ is the smallest $l$ for which $G$ permits graceful $l$-coloring. The problem of computing the graceful chromatic number of regular graphs is still open, though the existence of the lower bound was proved in \cite{3}. Hence, we pay attention to the computation of the graceful chromatic number of a special class of regular graphs namely complete graphs using set theoretic approach. Also, a few characterization of graphs based on their graceful chromatic number were examined.</description>

      <title>A Triangulation of the Flow Polytope of the Zigzag Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dual graph of the triangulation of the flow polytope of the zigzag graph adorned with the length-reverse-length framing is a subgraph of a grid graph. Through M\'esz\'aros, Morales, and Striker's bijection between simplices of the triangulation, integer flows of a different, supplemental flow polytope, we provide a simple numerical characterization of the adjacency between the triangulation's simplices in terms of their corresponding integer flows. The proofs result from the development of Postnikov and Stanley's sequences of noncrossing bipartite trees as combinatorial objects we call groves. We propose two new statistics derived from this construction that we conjecture recover the $h^*$-polynomial of the flow polytope of the zigzag graph.</description>

Abstract: A fair coin is flipped $n$ times, and two finite sequences of heads and tails (words) $A$ and $B$ of the same length are given. Each time the word $A$ appears in the sequence of coin flips, Alice gets a point, and each time the word $B$ appears, Bob gets a point. Who is more likely to win? This puzzle is a slight extension of Litt's game that recently set Twitter abuzz. We show that Litt's game is fair for any value of $n$ and any two words that have the same auto-correlation structure by building up a bijection that exchanges Bob and Alice scores; the fact that the inter-correlation does not come into play in this case may come up as a surprise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text provides an introduction to the field of distributed local algorithms -- an area at the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. We collect many recent results in the area and demonstrate how they lead to a clean theory. We also discuss many connections of local algorithms to areas such as parallel, distributed, and sublinear algorithms, or descriptive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Polarization and Gorenstein liaison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Gorenstein liaison is whether or not every arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Migliore and Nagel showed that, if such a scheme is generically Gorenstein (e.g., reduced), then, after re-embedding so that it is viewed as a subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, indeed it can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Motivated by this result, we consider techniques for constructing G-links on a scheme from G-links on a closely related reduced scheme.
  Polarization is a tool for producing a squarefree monomial ideal from an arbitrary monomial ideal. Basic double G-links on squarefree monomial ideals can be induced from vertex decompositions of their Stanley-Reisner complexes. Given a monomial ideal $I$ and a vertex decomposition of the Stanley-Reisner complex of its polarization $\mathcal{P}(I)$, we give conditions that allow for the lifting of an associated basic double G-link of $\mathcal{P}(I)$ to a basic double G-link of $I$ itself. We use the relationship we develop in the process to show that the Stanley-Reisner complexes of polarizations of artinian monomial ideals and of stable Cohen-Macaulay monomial ideals are vertex decomposable, recovering and strengthening the recent result of Fl{\o}ystad and Mafi that these complexes are shellable.
  We then introduce and study polarization of a Gr\"obner basis of an arbitrary homogeneous ideal and give a relationship between geometric vertex decomposition of a polarization and elementary G-biliaison that is analogous to our result on vertex decomposition and basic double G-linkage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers investigating for which positive integers $m$ there exists a maximal antichain of size $m$ in the Boolean lattice $B_n$ (the power set of $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, ordered by inclusion). In the first part, the sizes of maximal antichains have been characterized. Here we provide an alternative construction with the benefit of showing that almost all sizes of maximal antichains can be obtained using antichains containing only $l$-sets and $(l+1)$-sets for some $l$.</description>

      <title>HBS Tilings Extended: State of the Art and Novel Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons (H), boats (B) and stars (S) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called HBS tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict HBS tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <title>The inertia bound is far from tight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inertia bound and ratio bound (also known as the Cvetkovi\'c bound and Hoffman bound) are two fundamental inequalities in spectral graph theory, giving upper bounds on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ in terms of spectral information about a weighted adjacency matrix of $G$. For both inequalities, given a graph $G$, one needs to make a judicious choice of weighted adjacency matrix to obtain as strong a bound as possible.
  While there is a well-established theory surrounding the ratio bound, the inertia bound is much more mysterious, and its limits are rather unclear. In fact, only recently did Sinkovic find the first example of a graph for which the inertia bound is not tight (for any weighted adjacency matrix), answering a longstanding question of Godsil. We show that the inertia bound can be extremely far from tight, and in fact can significantly underperform the ratio bound: for example, one of our results is that for infinitely many $n$, there is an $n$-vertex graph for which even the unweighted ratio bound can prove $\alpha(G)\leq 4n^{3/4}$, but the inertia bound is always at least $n/4$. In particular, these results address questions of Rooney, Sinkovic, and Wocjan--Elphick--Abiad.</description>

      <title>Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and study the following conjecture: for an integer $t\geq 4$ and a graph $H$, every even-hole-free graph of large enough treewidth has an induced subgraph isomorphic to either $K_t$ or $H$, if (and only if) $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of the so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon.
  Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in two special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest $F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first result is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and $H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded treewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph.
  Also, for general $t\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b) by settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned forests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$ is a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by gluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars.
  In the first version of this paper, we suggested a strengthening of our main conjecture, that for every $t\geq 1$, every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$ which is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This strengthening has now been refuted by Chudnovsky and Trotignon [On treewidth and maximum cliques, arXiv:2405.07471, 2024].</description>

      <title>H-Clique-Width and a Hereditary Analogue of Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generalization of the notion of clique-width which aims to bridge the gap between classical hereditary width measures and the recently introduced graph product structure theory. Bounding the new H-clique-width, in the special case of H being the class of paths, is equivalent to admitting a hereditary (i.e., induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded clique-width. Furthermore, every graph admitting the usual (non-induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded tree-width, has bounded H-clique-width and, as a consequence, it admits the usual product structure in an induced way. We prove further basic properties of H-clique-width in general.</description>

Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions in the cases where the target clone $C_2$ is the clone of projections. Moreover, we explicitly describe the $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions in the cases where the source clone $C_1$ is one of the four clones of monotone functions or contains the discriminator function.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative error correcting codes and proper subgroup testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Property testing has been a major area of research in computer science in the last three decades. By property testing we refer to an ensemble of problems, results and algorithms which enable to deduce global information about some data by only reading small random parts of it. In recent years, this theory found its way into group theory, mainly via group stability.
  In this paper, we study the following problem: Devise a randomized algorithm that given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, decides whether $H$ is the whole group or a proper subgroup, by checking whether a single (random) element of $G$ is in $H$. The search for such an algorithm boils down to the following purely group theoretic problem: For $G$ of rank $k$, find a small as possible test subset $A\subseteq G$ such that for every proper subgroup $H$, $|H\cap A|\leq (1-\delta)|A|$ for some absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$, which we call the detection probability of $A$. It turns out that the search for sets $A$ of size linear in $k$ and constant detection probability is a non-commutative analogue of the classical search for families of good error correcting codes. This paper is devoted to proving that such test subsets exist, which implies good universal error correcting codes exist -- providing a far reaching generalization of the classical result of Shannon.
  In addition, we study this problem in certain subclasses of groups -- such as abelian, nilpotent, and finite solvable groups -- providing different constructions of test subsets for these subclasses with various qualities. Finally, this generalized theory of non-commutative error correcting codes suggests a plethora of interesting problems and research directions.</description>
