      <title>Analytic inference with two-way clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies analytic inference along two dimensions of clustering. In such setups, the commonly used approach has two drawbacks. First, the corresponding variance estimator is not necessarily positive. Second, inference is invalid in non-Gaussian regimes, namely when the estimator of the parameter of interest is not asymptotically Gaussian. We consider a simple fix that addresses both issues. In Gaussian regimes, the corresponding tests are asymptotically exact and equivalent to usual ones. Otherwise, the new tests are asymptotically conservative. We also establish their uniform validity over a certain class of data generating processes. Independently of our tests, we highlight potential issues with multiple testing and nonlinear estimators under two-way clustering. Finally, we compare our approach with existing ones through simulations.</description>

      <title>Wild Bootstrap Inference for Linear Regressions with Many Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification to the wild bootstrap procedure and establish its asymptotic validity for linear regression models with many covariates and heteroskedastic errors. Monte Carlo simulations show that the modified wild bootstrap has excellent finite sample performance compared with alternative methods that are based on standard normal critical values, especially when the sample size is small and/or the number of controls is of the same order of magnitude as the sample size.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Exposures to Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk across Crypto Assets: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes realized return behavior across a broad set of crypto assets by estimating heterogeneous exposures to idiosyncratic and systematic risk. A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide risk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies, while the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on empirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage ``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to high-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV regressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by extracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping it to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based indicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of heterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across asset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets, covering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term mean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility and illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to market-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi counterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic, market-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins. At a conceptual level, our study develops a coherent framework for isolating distinct layers of risk in crypto markets. Empirically, it sheds light on how return sensitivities vary across digital asset categories -- insights that are important for both portfolio design and regulatory oversight.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Decomposition of Generalized Entropy Measures Using Constrained Bayes Estimation: An Application to Japanese Regional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for multilevel decomposition of generalized entropy (GE) measures that explicitly accounts for nested population structures such as national, regional, and subregional levels. Standard approaches that estimate GE separately at each level do not guarantee compatibility with multilevel decomposition. Our method constrains lower-level GE estimates to match higher-level benchmarks while preserving hierarchical relationships across layers. We apply the method to Japanese income data to estimate GE at the national, prefectural, and municipal levels, decomposing national inequality into between-prefecture and within-prefecture inequality, and further decomposing prefectural GE into between-municipality and within-municipality inequality.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality conditions for convex regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Econometric identification generally relies on orthogonality conditions, which usually state that the random error term is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. In convex regression, the orthogonality conditions for identification are unknown. Applying Lagrangian duality theory, we establish the sample orthogonality conditions for convex regression, including additive and multiplicative formulations of the regression model, with and without monotonicity and homogeneity constraints. We then propose a hybrid instrumental variable control function approach to mitigate the impact of potential endogeneity in convex regression. The superiority of the proposed approach is shown in a Monte Carlo study and examined in an empirical application to Chilean manufacturing data.</description>

      <title>Estimating Nonlinear Network Data Models with Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce a new method for bias correction of dyadic models with agent-specific fixed effects, including the dyadic link formation model with homophily and degree heterogeneity. The proposed approach uses a jackknife procedure to deal with the incidental parameters problem. The method can be applied to both directed and undirected networks, allows for non-binary outcome variables, and can be used to bias correct estimates of average effects and counterfactual outcomes. I also show how the jackknife can be used to bias correct fixed-effect averages over functions that depend on multiple nodes, e.g. triads or tetrads in the network. As an example, I implement specification tests for dependence across dyads, such as reciprocity or transitivity. Finally, I demonstrate the usefulness of the estimator in an application to a gravity model for import/export relationships across countries.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Randomized Trials with Cross-Cluster Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The literature on cluster-randomized trials typically allows for interference within but not across clusters. This may be implausible when units are irregularly distributed across space without well-separated communities, as clusters in such cases may not align with significant geographic, social, or economic divisions. This paper develops methods for reducing bias due to cross-cluster interference. We first propose an estimation strategy that excludes units not surrounded by clusters assigned to the same treatment arm. We show that this substantially reduces bias relative to conventional difference-in-means estimators without significant cost to variance. Second, we formally establish a bias-variance trade-off in the choice of clusters: constructing fewer, larger clusters reduces bias due to interference but increases variance. We provide a rule for choosing the number of clusters to balance the asymptotic orders of the bias and variance of our estimator. Finally, we consider unsupervised learning for cluster construction and provide theoretical guarantees for $k$-medoids.</description>
