      <title>Chenciner bifurcation, strong resonances and Arnold tongues of a discrete time SIR epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the dynamic properties of a class of three-dimensional SIR models. Firstly, we use the {\it complete discriminant theory} of polynomials to obtain the parameter conditions for the topological types of each fixed point. Secondly, by employing the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory, we prove that the system can undergo codimension 1 bifurcations, including transcritical, flip and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, and codimension 2 bifurcations which contain Chenciner bifurcation, 1:3 and 1:4 strong resonances. Besides, by the theory of normal form, we give theoretically the Arnold tongues in the weak resonances such that the system possesses two periodic orbits on the stable invariant closed curve generated from the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Finally, in order to verify the theoretical results, we detect all codimension 1 and 2 bifurcations by using MatcontM and numerically simulate all bifurcation phenomena and the Arnold tongues in the weak resonances.</description>

      <title>On fast Lyapunov spectra for Markov-R\'{e}nyi maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multifractal analysis for Markov-R\'{e}nyi maps, which form a canonical class of piecewise differentiable interval maps, with countably many branches and may contain a parabolic fixed point simultaneously, and do not assume any distortion hypotheses. We develop a geometric approach, independent of thermodynamic formalism, to study the fast Lyapunov spectrum for Markov-R\'{e}nyi maps. Our study can be regarded as a refinement of the Lyapunov spectrum at infinity. We demonstrate that the fast Lyapunov spectrum is a piecewise constant function, possibly exhibiting a discontinuity at infinity. Our results extend the works in \cite[Theorem 1.1]{FLWW13}, \cite[Theorem 1.2]{LR}, and \cite[Theorem 1.2]{FSW} from the Gauss map to arbitrary Markov-R\'{e}nyi maps, and highlight several intrinsic differences between the fast Lyapunov spectrum and the classical Lyapunov spectrum. Moreover, we establish the upper and lower fast Lyapunov spectra for Markov-R\'{e}nyi maps.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of $\mathbb{R}^d$-ergodic averages constructed over a strictly convex set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\mathbb{R}^d$-ergodic means constructed over a strictly convex set, a spectral criterion for homogeneous rates of convergence is obtained. From Hertz's result on the asymptotics of the Fourier transform of the indicator of a strictly convex set, it follows that the rate of convergence does not depend on the specific form of such a set.</description>

      <title>A general multi-stratum model for a nanofunctionalized releasing capsule: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Releasing capsules are widely employed in biomedical applications as smart carriers of therapeutic agents, including drugs and bioactive compounds. Such delivery vehicles typically consist of a loaded core, enclosed by one or multiple concentric coating strata. In this work, we extend over existing mechanistic models to account for such multi-strata structures, and we characterise the release kinetics of the active substance into the surrounding medium.
  We present a computational study of drug release from a multi-stratum spherical microcapsule, modelled through a non-linear diffusion equation incorporating radial anisotropy and space- and time-discontinuous coefficients. The problem is solved numerically using a finite volume scheme on a grid with adaptive spatial and temporal resolution. Analytical expressions for concentration and cumulative release are derived for all strata, enabling the exploration of parameter sensitivity -- such as coating permeability and internal diffusivity -- on the overall release profile.
  The resulting release curves provide mechanistic insight into the transport processes and offer design criteria for achieving controlled release. Model predictions are benchmarked against in vitro experimental data obtained under physiologically relevant conditions, showing good agreement and validating the key features of the model. The proposed model thus serves as a practical tool for predicting the behaviour of composite coated particles, supporting performance evaluation and the rational design of next-generation drug delivery systems with reduced experimental effort.</description>

      <title>The existence of quasi-periodic invariant tori and double Hopf bifurcation of van der Pol's oscillator with delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double Hopf bifurcation and the existence of quasi-periodic invariant tori in a delayed van der Pol's oscillator are considered by regarding the damped coefficient and the delay as bifurcation parameters. Applying the center manifold reduction and the normal form method, we derive the normal form near the critical point and analyse the existence of invariant 2-tori and 3-tori for the truncated normal form. Furthermore, the effect of higher-order terms on these invariant tori are investigated by a KAM theorem, and it is proved that in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the bifurcation point, the delayed van der Pol's oscillator has quasi-periodic invariant 2-tori and 3-tori for most of the parameter set where its truncated normal form possesses quasi-periodic invariant 2-tori and 3-tori, respectively.</description>

      <title>Convergent Methods for Koopman Operators on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions. However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in $L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms. Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging, high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow, molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.</description>

      <title>The simplest chaos indicator derived from Lagrangian descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the simplest chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs), defined as the difference in LD values between two neighboring trajectories. This difference LD is remarkably easy to implement and interpret, offering a direct and intuitive measure of dynamical behavior. We provide a heuristic argument linking its growth to the regularity or chaoticity of the underlying initial condition, considering both arclength-based and $p$-norm formulations of LDs. To evaluate its effectiveness, we benchmark it against more elaborate LD-based chaos indicators using two prototypical systems: the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. Our results show that, despite its simplicity, the difference LD matches, and in some cases surpasses, the accuracy of more sophisticated methods, making it a robust and accessible tool for chaos detection in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy and measures on limit sets of Anosov groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For any Zariski dense Anosov subgroup $\Gamma &lt;G$, we show that a $\Gamma$-conformal measure is supported on the limit set of $\Gamma$ if and only if its "dimension" is $\Gamma$-critical. This implies the uniqueness of a $\Gamma$-conformal measure for each critical dimension. We deduce this from a higher rank analogue of the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy for the maximal diagonal action. Other applications include an analogue of the Ahlfors measure conjecture for Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <title>A degenerate Arnold diffusion mechanism in the Restricted 3 Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major question in dynamical systems is to understand the mechanisms driving global instability in the 3 Body Problem (3BP), which models the motion of three bodies under Newtonian gravitational interaction. The 3BP is called restricted if one of the bodies has zero mass and the other two, the primaries, have strictly positive masses $m_0,m_1$. We consider the Restricted Planar Elliptic 3 Body Problem (RPE3BP) where the primaries revolve in Keplerian ellipses. We prove that the RPE3BP exhibits topological instability: for any values of the masses $m_0,m_1$ (except $m_0=m_1$), we build orbits along which the angular momentum of the massless body experiences an arbitrarily large variation provided the eccentricity of the orbit of the primaries is positive but small enough.
  In order to prove this result we show that a degenerate Arnold Diffusion Mechanism, which moreover involves exponentially small phenomena, takes place in the RPE3BP. Our work extends the one by Delshams, Kaloshin, De la Rosa, Seara (2019) for the a priori unstable case $m_1/m_0\ll1$, to the case of arbitrary masses $m_0,m_1&gt;0$, where the model displays features of the so-called a priori stable setting.</description>

      <title>Discrete nonlinear elastodynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a fully nonlinear port-Hamiltonian formulation for discrete elastodynamical systems as well as a structure-preserving time discretization. The governing equations are obtained in a variational manner and represent index-1 differential algebraic equations. Performing an index reduction one obtains the port-Hamiltonian state space model, which features the nonlinear strains as an independent state next to position and velocity. Moreover, hyperelastic material behavior is captured in terms of a nonlinear stored energy function. The model exhibits passivity and losslessness and has an underlying symmetry yielding the conservation of angular momentum. We perform temporal discretization using the midpoint discrete gradient, such that the beneficial properties are inherited by the developed time stepping scheme in a discrete sense. The numerical results obtained in a representative example are demonstrated to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity in the linked twist map with oppositely oriented shears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reduce the earlier known optimal shear parameter for which ergodicity is established in the linked twist map with two linear shears in opposite sense, in the most general setting. Further, here we obtain ergodicity with possibly only one-fold twists in either lobe, while earlier results only applied for twist parameters at least 2. Almost hyperbolicity is easily established for shear parameters greater than 2, while in the most general setting of the linked twist map with both shears of equal magnitude, ergodicity was earlier established in the most general setting by Przytycki for shear parameters greater than 4.15 with at least two-fold twists in each lobe. Here we reduce this optimal shear parameter to 3.47 in the general setting. These techniques can be effected to make further improvements when additional assumptions are made on the dimensions of the strips or when the linked twist map is modified in other natural ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper follows on from our previous work, where we introduced the notion of \emph{confined extensions}, and our purpose is to widen the context in which such extensions appear. We do so in the setup of Poisson suspensions: we take a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving dynamical system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$, then we consider the corresponding Poisson extension $((X \times G)^*, (\mu \otimes m_G)^*, (T_\phi)_*) \overset{}{\to} (X^*, \mu^*, T_*)$. Our results give two different conditions under which that extension is confined. Finally, to show that those conditions are not void, we give an example of a system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a cocycle $\phi$ so that the compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$ has an infinite ergodic index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss whether classical examples of dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property also satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua, obtaining both positive and negative results. We prove that transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms, or more generally continuum-wise hyperbolic homeomorphisms, do not satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua. We prove that dendrite monotone maps satisfy the shadowing property if, and only if, their induced map on the hyperspace of continua also satisfies it. We give some algorithms that show that there are abundant dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property with dendrites (compact metric trees) as the underlying space. As a consequence, we show that the universal dendrite of order n admits a homeomorphism with the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Baby Mandelbrot sets and Spines in some one-dimensional subspaces of the parameter space for generalized McMullen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions of the form $R_{n,c,a}(z) = z^n + \dfrac{a}{z^n}+c$,
  known as ``Generalized McMullen maps'', for $a\neq 0$ and $n \geq 3$ fixed, we study the boundedness locus in some one-dimensional slices of the $(a,c)$-parameter space, by fixing a parameter or imposing a relation.
  First, if we fix $c$ with $|c|\geq 6$ while allowing $a$ to vary, assuming a modest lower bound on $n$ in terms of $|c|$, we establish the location in the $a$-plane of $n$ ``baby" Mandelbrot sets, that is, homeomorphic copies of the original Mandelbrot set. We use polynomial-like maps, introduced by Douady and Hubbard and applied for the subfamily $R_{n,a,0}$ by Devaney.
  Second, for slices in which $c=ta$, we again observe what look like baby Mandelbrot sets within these slices, and begin the study of this subfamily by establishing a neighborhood containing the boundedness locus.</description>

Abstract: Following recent work of T. Alazard and C. Shao on applications of para-differential calculus to smooth conjugacy and stability problems for Hamiltonian systems, we prove finite codimension stability of invariant surfaces (in finite differentiability classes) of flat geodesic flows on translation surfaces. The result is also based on work of the author on the cohomological equation for translation flows.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for the pseudo-Riemannian geodesic flows of step-two nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the stability analysis for the geodesic flow of a step-two nilpotent Lie group equipped with a left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric. The Lie-Poisson equation can be described in terms of the so-called $j$-mapping, a linear operator associated to the step-two nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with the induced scalar product. The stability of equilibrium points for the Hamilton equation is determined in terms of their Williamson types.</description>

      <title>Observations on robust diffusive stability and common Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of robust diffusive stability (RDS) for a pair of coupled stable discrete-time positive linear-time invariant (LTI) systems. We first show that the existence of a common diagonal Lyapunov function is sufficient for RDS and highlight how this condition differs from recent results using linear copositive Lyapunov functions. We also present an extension of these results, showing that the weaker condition of \emph{joint} linear copositive function existence is also sufficient for RDS. Finally, we present two results on RDS for extended Leslie matrices arising in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surface Entropy and Average Area Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any closed hyperbolizable 3-manifold, we find a sharp relation between the minimal surface entropy (introduced by Calegari-Marques-Neves) and the average area ratio (introduced by Gromov), and we show that, among metrics g with scalar curvature greater than or equal to -6, the former is maximized by the hyperbolic metric. One corollary is to solve a conjecture of Gromov regarding the average area ratio. Our proofs use Ricci flow with surgery and laminar measures invariant under a PSL(2,R)-action.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of partial automorphisms twisted by vector bundles I: Fixed point algebra, simplicity and the tracial state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a $C^*$-algebra to a partial action of the integers acting on the base space of a vector bundle, using the framework of Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. We investigate the structure of the fixed point algebra under the canonical gauge action, and show that it arises from a continuous field of $C^*$-algebras over the base space, generalising results of Vasselli. We also analyse the ideal structure, and show that for a free action, ideals correspond to open invariant subspaces of the base space. This shows that if the action is free and minimal, then the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra is simple. In the case of a line bundle, we establish a bijective corrrespondence between tracial states on the algebra and invariant measures on the base space. This generalizes results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms twisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung and Viola.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>Cup and cap products for cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the cup and cap products within the cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids, focusing on their applications and fundamental properties. Ample groupoids, which are \'etale groupoids with a totally disconnected unit space, play a crucial role in the study of topological dynamical systems and operator algebras. We introduce the cup product, which defines a bilinear map on cohomology classes, providing a graded ring structure, and the cap product, which defines a bilinear map relating homology and cohomology. The paper aims to make these concepts accessible to a broader mathematical audience, offering clear definitions and detailed explanations. We also demonstrate an application of the cap product in the analysis of automorphisms of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Specifically, we show how it helps determine the asymptotic innerness of automorphisms. Our results include the first explicit computations of cup products in the cohomology of tiling spaces, which may pave the way for new research in this area.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory dynamics. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network, which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>
