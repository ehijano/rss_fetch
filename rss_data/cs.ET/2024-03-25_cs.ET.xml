      <title>Molecular Communication-Based Intelligent Dopamine Rate Modulator for Parkinson's Disease Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and it is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia (BG). Currently, there is no definite cure for PD, and available treatments mainly aim to alleviate its symptoms. Due to impaired neurotransmitter-based information transmission in PD, molecular communication-based approaches can be employed as potential solutions to address this issue. Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method utilizing molecules for carrying information. This mode of communication stands out for developing bio-compatible nanomachines for diagnosing and treating, particularly in addressing neurodegenerative diseases like PD, due to its compatibility with biological systems. This study presents a novel treatment method that introduces an Intelligent Dopamine Rate Modulator (IDRM), which is located in the synaptic gap between the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum to compensate for insufficiency dopamine release in BG caused by PD. For storing dopamine in the IDRM, dopamine compound (DAC) is swallowed and crossed through the digestive system, blood circulatory system, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and brain extracellular matrix uptakes with IDRMs. Here, the DAC concentration is calculated in these regions, revealing that the required exogenous dopamine consistently reaches IDRM. Therefore, the perpetual dopamine insufficiency in BG associated with PD can be compensated. This method reduces drug side effects because dopamine is not released in other brain regions. Unlike other treatments, this approach targets the root cause of PD rather than just reducing symptoms.</description>

      <title>Electron-Tunnelling-Noise Programmable Random Variate Accelerator for Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a Petitbateau FemtoRV RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times$that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>

      <title>Partially-Precise Computing Paradigm for Efficient Hardware Implementation of Application-Specific Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the number of emerging embedded systems rapidly grows in many application domains, due to recent advances in artificial intelligence and internet of things. The main inherent specification of these application-specific systems is that they have not a general nature and are basically developed to only perform a particular task and therefore, deal only with a limited and predefined range of custom input values. Despite this significant feature, these emerging applications are still conventionally implemented using general-purpose and precise digital computational blocks, which are essentially developed to provide the correct result for all possible input values. This highly degrades the physical properties of these applications while does not improve their functionality. To resolve this conflict, a novel computational paradigm named as partially-precise computing is introduced in this paper, based on an inspiration from the brain information reduction hypothesis as a tenet of neuroscience. The main specification of a Partially-Precise Computational (PPC) block is that it provides the precise result only for a desired, limited, and predefined set of input values. This relaxes its internal structure which results in improved physical properties with respect to a conventional precise block. The PPC blocks improve the implementation costs of the embedded applications, with a negligible or even without any output quality degradation with respect to the conventional implementation. The applicability and efficiency of the first instances of PPC adders and multipliers in a Gaussian denoising filter, an image blending and a face recognition neural network are demonstrated by means of a wide range of simulation and synthesis results.</description>

      <title>Depth-Optimal Addressing of 2D Qubit Array with 1D Controls Based on Exact Binary Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing control complexity is essential for achieving large-scale quantum computing. However, reducing control knobs may compromise the ability to independently address each qubit. Recent progress in neutral atom-based platforms suggests that rectangular (row-column) addressing may strike a balance between control granularity and flexibility for 2D qubit arrays. This scheme allows addressing qubits on the intersections of a set of rows and columns each time. While quadratically reducing controls, it may necessitate more depth. We formulate the depth-optimal rectangular addressing problem as exact binary matrix factorization, an NP-hard problem also appearing in communication complexity and combinatorial optimization. We introduce a satisfiability modulo theories-based solver for this problem, and a heuristic, row packing, performing close to the optimal solver on various benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss rectangular addressing in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, leveraging a natural two-level structure.</description>
