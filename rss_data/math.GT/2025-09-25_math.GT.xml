      <title>A Morse complex for the homology of vanishing cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Morse homology groups associated with any regular function on a smooth complex algebraic variety, allowing singular and non-compact critical loci. These groups are generated by critical points of a certain large pertubation of the function, built from a normal crossing compactification of the variety. They are canonically isomorphic to the homology of vanishing cycles and -- in the absence of bifurcations at infinity -- recover the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, studied extensively in singularity theory and enumerative geometry. Our construction arises as a special case of a more general construction of Morse homology of non-compact manifolds that admit a compactification by a manifold with corners.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz pencils on a complex projective plane from a topological viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a differential topological construction of symplectic Lefschetz pencils of genus $\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$ with $d^2$ base points and $3(d-1)^2$ critical points for arbitrary $d\geq 4$, analogous to the holomorphic Lefschetz pencils of curves of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{C}P^2$. Moreover, for the case $d=4$, we derive an explicit monodromy factorization of the genus $3$ holomorphic Lefschetz pencil on $\mathbb{C}P^2$ based on the braid monodromy technique and prove that it can also be topologically constructed by breeding the monodromy relations of the genus $1$ holomorphic Lefschetz pencils.</description>

      <title>The Euler class of infinite-type surface bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler class of smooth orientable infinite-type surface bundles with a section. For many such surfaces, we show that this cohomology class is nontrivial, and that the behavior of its powers depends on the genus and the type of ends. As an application, we extend Morita's non-lifting theorem to many infinite-type surfaces, including surfaces of infinite genus.</description>

      <title>Every negative amphichiral knot is rationally slice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, Kawauchi proved that every strongly negative amphichiral knot is rationally slice. However, as shown by Hartley in 1980, there are examples of negative amphichiral knots that are not strongly negative amphichiral. In this paper, we prove that every negative amphichiral link whose amphichiral map preserves each component is rationally slice. Our proof relies on a systematic analysis of the action induced by the negative amphichiral map on the JSJ decomposition of the link exterior. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions on such an action to deduce when a negative amphichiral knot is either isotopic to, or concordant to, a strongly negative amphichiral knot. In particular, we prove that every fibered negative amphichiral knot is strongly negative amphichiral, answering a question asked by Kim and Wu in 2016 on Miyazaki knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the arc index of an adequate link and establish bounds on the arc index of the closure of a positive 3-braid. We also conjecture an inequality between the crossing number, arc index, and Turaev genus of a link and show the conjecture is true for several infinite families of links including alternating links, links with Turaev genus one, adequate links, closures of positive 3-braids, torus links, and most Kanenobu knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fatness of a 4-polytope or 3-sphere is defined as $(f_1+f_2-20)/(f_0+f_3-10)$. We construct arbitrarily fat, strongly regular CW 3-spheres that are both shellable and dual shellable. These spheres have $f$-vectors $(\Theta(n),\Theta(n\alpha(n)),\Theta(n\alpha(n)),\Theta(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function.</description>

      <title>Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
  Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu.</description>

      <title>Trivalent vertices and bordered knot Floer homology in the standard basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define new algebras, local bimodules, and bimodule maps in the spirit of Ozsvath-Szabo's bordered knot Floer homology. We equip them with the structure of 2-representations of the categorified negative half U^- of U_q(gl(1|1)), 1-morphisms of such, and 2-morphisms respectively, and show that they categorify representations of U_q(gl(1|1)^-) and maps between them. Unlike with Ozsvath-Szabo's algebras, the algebras considered here can be built from a higher tensor product operation recently introduced by Rouquier and the author.
  Our bimodules are all motivated by holomorphic disk counts in Heegaard diagrams; for positive and negative crossings, the bimodules can also be expressed as mapping cones involving a singular-crossing bimodule and the identity bimodule. In fact, they arise from an action of the monoidal category of Soergel bimodules via Rouquier complexes in the usual way, the first time (to the author's knowledge) such an expression has been obtained for braiding bimodules in Heegaard Floer homology.
  Furthermore, the singular crossing bimodule naturally factors into two bimodules for trivalent vertices; such bimodules have not appeared in previous bordered-Floer approaches to knot Floer homology. The action of the Soergel category comes from an action of categorified quantum gl(2) on the 2-representation 2-category of U^- in line with the ideas of skew Howe duality, where the trivalent vertex bimodules are associated to 1-morphisms E, F in categorified quantum gl(2).</description>

      <title>On the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture (and prove for once-punctured torus bundles) that the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of a punctured surface at roots of unity coincide with the 1-loop invariant of their mapping torus at roots of unity. This explains the topological invariance of the BWY invariants and how their volume conjecture, to all orders, and with exponentially small terms included, follows from the quantum modularity conjecture. Using the numerical methods of Zagier and the first author, we illustrate how to efficiently compute the invariants and their asymptotics to arbitrary order in perturbation theory, using as examples the $LR$ and the $LLR$ pseudo-Anosov monodromies of the once-punctured torus. Finally, we introduce descendant versions of the 1-loop and BWY invariants and conjecture (and numerically check for pseudo-Anosov monodromies of $L/R$-length at most 5) that they are related by a Fourier transform. This edition includes statements and proofs for roots of unity of all order, even and odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05151v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.</description>

      <title>On the multiplicity of Knot Floer order under cabling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The knot Floer order $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ is a knot invariant derived from knot Floer homology that provides bounds on many other invariants, such as the bridge index $\operatorname{br}(K)$ for which $\operatorname{Ord}(K) + 1 \leq \operatorname{br}(K)$. For all $(p,q)$-cables of L-space knots, we show that $\operatorname{Ord}(K) + 1$ is multiplicative in $p$ when $g(K) &gt; 1$, and the same holds for $g(K) = 1$ provided $q &gt; 2p$. We also compute the knot Floer order in the range $q &lt; 2p$, thereby determining $\operatorname{Ord}(K_{p,q})$ in terms of $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ for all cables of L-space knots. We establish upper bounds under cabling for $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ and discuss potential applications to a conjecture by Krishna and Morton, proving that the braid index of an L-space cable appears as an exponent in its Alexander polynomial if it does for its companion, provided $\operatorname{Ord}(K)+1$ is multiplicative.</description>

      <title>Center of stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we show some properties of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras related to their centers for essentially bordered pb surfaces, especially their centers, finitely generation over their centers, and their PI-degrees. The proofs are based on the quantum trace maps, embeddings of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras into quantum tori appearing in higher Teichm\"uller theory. Thanks to the Unicity theorem in [BG02, FKBL19], we can understand the representation theory of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. Moreover, the applications are beyond low-dimensional topology. For example, we can access to the representation theory of unrestricted quantum moduli algebras, and that of quantum higher cluster algebras potentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. However, their five degeneracy relations are in fact redundant. In the present paper, we unify these five conditions into a single degeneracy condition and resolve the issue of the well-definedness of the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex. This provides an appropriate definition of the Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the usual Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a consequence, we obtain an alternative proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>
