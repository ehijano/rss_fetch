      <title>MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized the field of morphology, creating large collections of 3D data, and microCT in particular. This revolution was initially supported by the development of open-source software tools, specifically the development of SlicerMorph extension to the open-source image analytics platform 3D Slicer. Through SlicerMorph and 3D Slicer, biologists, morphologists and scientists in related fields have all the necessary tools to import, visualize and analyze these complex and large datasets in a single platform that is flexible and expandible, without the need of proprietary software that hinders scientific collaboration and sharing.
  Yet, a significant "compute gap" remains: While data and software are now open and accessible, the necessary high-end computing resources to run them are often not equally accessible in all institutions, and particularly lacking at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and other educational settings. Here, we present MorphoCloud, an "IssuesOps"-based platform that leverages Github Actions and the JetStream2 cloud farm to provide on-demand, research-grade computing environments to researchers working with 3D morphological datasets. By delivering a GPU-accelerated full desktop experience via a web browser, MorphoCloud eliminates hardware barriers, enabling complex 3D analysis and AI-assisted segmentation. This paper explains the platform and its architecture, as well as use cases it is designed to support.</description>

      <title>Genotype-Phenotype Integration through Machine Learning and Personalized Gene Regulatory Networks for Cancer Metastasis Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet most predictive models rely on shallow architectures and neglect patient-specific regulatory mechanisms. Here, we integrate classical machine learning and deep learning to predict metastatic potential across multiple cancer types. Gene expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia were combined with a transcription factor-target prior from DoRothEA, focusing on nine metastasis-associated regulators. After selecting differential genes using the Kruskal-Wallis test, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained for benchmarking. Personalized gene regulatory networks were then constructed using PANDA and LIONESS and analyzed through a graph attention neural network (GATv2) to learn topological and expression-based representations. While XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.7051), the GNN captured non-linear regulatory dependencies at the patient level. These results demonstrate that combining traditional machine learning with graph-based deep learning enables a scalable and interpretable framework for metastasis risk prediction in precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reconstruction of Disease Networks from Longitudinal Blood Data for Causal Discovery and Intervention Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the hyperparameters and introduce a methodological framework to convert disease patterns from time series data of blood test results into correlation graphs for causal hypothesis exploration. The networks represent hypotheses that can then be validated or rejected both for causal discovery and causal analysis (under intervention). We synthetically recreated a repository of 105 typical disease longitudinal patterns extracted from medical guidance and research literature of common blood markers to build a systematic pipeline to translate multidimensional clinical data into intervenable disease networks for causal discovery and causal analysis. This study demonstrates that knowledge graphical models reconstructed from longitudinal data can transform routine medical data into clinically interpretable structures. By integrating multiple thresholding strategies and causal graph design, the framework has the purpose to move beyond statistical correlation toward clinically and testable inference networks. These results highlight a practical pathway for more transparent, explainable, and scalable tools in clinical decision support for AI training, precision healthcare and predictive medicine, offering interpretable, clinically actionable outputs that support safer use of AI in differential diagnosis.</description>
