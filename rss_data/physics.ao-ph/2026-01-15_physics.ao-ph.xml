      <title>Learning a Stochastic Differential Equation Model of Tropical Cyclone Intensification from Reanalysis and Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.</description>

      <title>Finite-system size effects in gravity-capillary wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effects of finite-system size on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear random gravity-capillary surface waves. Experiments are conducted in rectangular tanks with varying aspect ratios, in which the fluid surface is perturbed locally and erratically by small, partially submerged magnets. Driven by an oscillating vertical electromagnetic field, these magnets generate a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random wave field. This setup enables us to probe finite-size effects without the dominant influence of global forcing present in horizontally oscillated tanks. Spatiotemporal measurements of the wave field reveal multiple branches in the wave-energy spectrum along the unconfined direction, corresponding to sloshing modes in the confined direction. We show that the spectral properties of these modes can be tuned by varying either the wave steepness or the confinement. Signatures of discrete wave turbulence in the confined direction and mesoscopic continuous wave turbulence in the unconfined direction are observed. As the confinement is gradually relaxed, we further demonstrate a smooth transition from discrete to continuous wave turbulence, consistent with the nonlinear-to-discreteness timescale ratio. Using high-order correlation analysis, we also show that finite-size effects alter wave dynamics by depleting two-dimensional three-wave resonant interactions along the confined direction.</description>

      <title>Searth Transformer: A Transformer Architecture Incorporating Earth's Geospheric Physical Priors for Global Mid-Range Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.</description>

      <title>CuMoLoS-MAE: A Masked Autoencoder for Remote Sensing Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis.</description>
