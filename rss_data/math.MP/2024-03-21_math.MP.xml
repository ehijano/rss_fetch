      <title>What is isotropic turbulence and why is it important?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article begins with an overview, then gives the precise definition of isotropic turbulence, and follows that with the basic conservation equations, in both real space and wavenumber space. These provide the foundations of all theoretical approaches, both fundamental and phenomenological. After that, my intention is to try to highlight the main unresolved issues and give some indication of what progress there has been over decades (in all cases), and what still needs to be done. I should emphasise that I am not trying to provide either a conventional review or even a pedagogical treatment. Instead I am giving concise summaries, supplemented (where I can) by my own observations, which make substantial points that I believe are original, and which have not been made in the literature. To take just one example, it is known by some people that Kolmogorov's 1962 theory is not correctly described as a 'refinement' of his 1941 theory. This was pointed out by Kraichnan in 1974. However, what does not appear to have been recognized is that the 1962 theory is physically invalid, and also that a plausible implementation of it destroys the Kolmogorov (1941) scaling of energy spectra which has been widely observed over many years. This is discussed in Section 4 below. Lastly, I have tried to give an informal treatment in order to make everything easily accessible, to reach the widest possible audience. In particular, the section on renormalization methods is written without giving the equations of the various theories, merely stating in words what has been done, what are the different methods and also what still needs to be done.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Lattice Schr\"{o}dinger-Type Operators Associated with the Nonstationary Anderson Model and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research explores a high irregularity, commonly referred to as intermittency, of the solution to the non-stationary parabolic Anderson problem: \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \varkappa \mathcal{L}u(t,x) + \xi_{t}(x)u(t,x) \end{equation*} with the initial condition \(u(0,x) \equiv 1\), where \((t,x) \in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{Z}^d\). Here, \(\varkappa \mathcal{L}\) denotes a non-local Laplacian, and \(\xi_{t}(x)\) is a correlated white noise potential. The observed irregularity is intricately linked to the upper part of the spectrum of the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the moment functions \(m_p(t,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_p) = \langle u(t,x_1)u(t,x_2)\cdots u(t,x_p)\rangle\).
  In the first half of the paper, a weak form of intermittency is expressed through moment functions of order $p\geq 3$ and established for a wide class of operators $\varkappa \mathcal{L}$ with a positive-definite correlator $B=B(x))$ of the white noise. In the second half of the paper, the strong intermittency is studied. It relates to the existence of a positive eigenvalue for the lattice Schr\"odinger type operator with the potential $B$. This operator is associated with the second moment $m_2$. Now $B$ is not necessarily positive-definite, but $\sum B(x)\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Ising Model on multiregular random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of multispecies Ising models on generalized regular random graphs is investigated in the thermodynamic limit. The architecture is specified by class-dependent couplings and magnetic fields. We prove that the magnetizations, neighbours correlations and free energy converge to suitable functions evaluated at the solution of a belief propagation fixed point equation. In absence of magnetic fields, a phase transition is identified and the corresponding critical parameters are determined by the spectral radius of a low-dimensional matrix.</description>

      <title>On Intermediate Exceptional Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Freudenthal--Tits magic square $\mathfrak{m}(\mathbb{A}_1,\mathbb{A}_2)$ for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ of semi-simple Lie algebras can be extended by including the sextonions $\mathbb{S}$. A series of non-reductive Lie algebras naturally appear in the new row associated with the sextonions, which we will call the \textit{intermediate exceptional series}, with the largest one as the intermediate Lie algebra $E_{7+1/2}$ constructed by Landsberg--Manivel. We study various aspects of the intermediate vertex operator (super)algebras associated with the intermediate exceptional series, including rationality, coset constructions, irreducible modules, (super)characters and modular linear differential equations. For all $\mathfrak{g}_I$ belonging to the intermediate exceptional series, the intermediate VOA $L_1(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ has characters of irreducible modules coinciding with those of the simple rational $C_2$-cofinite $W$-algebra $W_{-h^\vee/6}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ studied by Kawasetsu, with $\mathfrak{g} $ belonging to the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. We propose some new intermediate VOA $L_k(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ with integer level $k$ and investigate their properties. For example, for the intermediate Lie algebra $D_{6+1/2}$ between $D_6$ and $E_7$ in the subexceptional series and also in Vogel's projective plane, we find that the intermediate VOA $L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ has a simple current extension to a SVOA with four irreducible Neveu--Schwarz modules. We also provide some (super) coset constructions such as $L_2(E_7)/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ and $L_1(D_{6+1/2})^{\otimes2}\!/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$. In the end, we find that the theta blocks associated with the intermediate exceptional series produce some new holomorphic Jacobi forms of critical weight and lattice index.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interaction with large spin in the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a coupling spin-orbit in the semi-classical regime $\hbar\searrow 0$ and large spin number $\spin\rightarrow +\infty$ such that $\hbar^\delta\spin=c$ where $c&gt;0$ and $\delta&gt;0$ are constant. The initial state $\Psi(0)$ is a product of an orbital coherent state in $L^2(\R^d)$ and a spin coherent state in a spin irreducible representation space ${\mathcal H}_{2\spin +1}$. For $\delta &lt;1$, at the leading order in $\hbar$, the time evolution $\Psi(t)$ of $ \Psi(0)$ is well approximated by the product of an orbital and a spin coherent state. Nevertheless for $1/2&lt;\delta&lt;1$ the quantum orbital leaves the classical orbital. For $\delta=1$ we prove that this last claim is no more true when the interaction depends on the orbital variables.
  For the Dicke model, we prove that the orbital partial trace of the projector on $\Psi(t)$ is a mixed state in $L^2(\R)$ for small $t&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Breaking consensus in kinetic opinion formation models on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

      <title>Analytic expression of the DOS for a new model of 1d-potential and its random perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present comparisons between the spectrum of a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator for a particular periodic potential and for its restriction to a finite number of sites. We deduce from this finite, but large, number of sites, the Integrated Density of States (IDS) associated to the Hamiltonian operator whose derivate is the DOS. The exact formula for the IDS is given and the expression of the DOS is analytical. All our calculations are done on the particular periodic Airy-potential, which is a new case for which one has an analytical expression of the DOS. It is a continuous, periodic potential, piecewise affine. As a periodic operator, the spectrum is a band spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is the most relevant characteristic of systems of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized equation that embeds all of them.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the collective non-Markovian decay of two fully excited quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous decay of a quantum emitter can be significantly affected by both, the state of other emitters and the state of the surrounding radiation. Such instances combine two central topics in quantum optics that are typically treated separately: collective decay and non-Markovian dynamics. Here we access collective non-Markovian decay through the exact solution for two excited quantum emitters located at adjacent unit cells of a one-dimensional single-band waveguide. The transformed field amplitudes, which we express in terms of elementary functions, combine exponential, algebraic, fractional, and mixed algebraic-exponential decay, as well as logarithmic corrections to some of the algebraic parts. We develop analytic methods for multiparticle open quantum systems that shed light on the complexity of non-linear quantum optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced shallow circuits and absence of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalized multiscale finite element method for a nonlinear elastic strain-limiting Cosserat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nonlinear Cosserat elasticity, we consider multiscale methods in this paper. In particular, we explore the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) to solve an isotropic Cosserat problem with strain-limiting property (ensuring bounded linearized strains even under high stresses). Such strain-limiting Cosserat model can find potential applications in solids and biological fibers. However, Cosserat media with naturally rotational degrees of freedom, nonlinear constitutive relations, high contrast, and heterogeneities may produce challenging multiscale characteristics in the solution, and upscaling by multiscale methods is necessary. Therefore, we utilize the offline and residual-based online (adaptive or uniform) GMsFEM in this context while handling the nonlinearity by Picard iteration. Through various two-dimensional experiments (for perforated, composite, and stochastically heterogeneous media with small and big strain-limiting parameters), our numerical results show the approaches' convergence, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, these results demonstrate that such approaches provide good accuracy, the online GMsFEM gives more accurate solutions than the offline one, and the online adaptive strategy has similar accuracy to the uniform one but with fewer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Continuous dependence on data for linear evolution PDEs on the quarter-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we announce a systematic analysis of continuous dependence on the data in classical spaces for the initial-boundary-value problem of the diffusion equation on the half-line, with data that are not necessarily compatible at the quadrant corner. This is based on a recent approach to rigorously analyzing integral representations derived via the unified transform method of Fokas. No exotic phenomena were discovered in this case, yet our findings appear to be new in the pertinent literature. These results supplement our previous investigations on existence and (non)uniqueness within the framework of well-posedness. The present detailed exposition elucidates the subtleties involved while also demonstrating a generic technique. Applications of the latter to several other IBVPs and PDEs will be reported elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Singularities and growth of higher order discrete equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the link between the degree growth of integrable birational mappings of order higher than two and their singularity structures. The higher order mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.</description>

      <title>Optimal Second-Order Rates for Quantum Information Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the standard quantum information decoupling, in which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an $\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of the remainder system in terms of the conditional $(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only local operations and one-way classical communications.</description>

      <title>Quantum resonances and scattering poles of classical rank one locally symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For negatively curved symmetric spaces it is known that the poles of the scattering matrices defined via the standard intertwining operators for the spherical principal representations of the isometry group are either given as poles of the intertwining operators or as quantum resonances, i.e. poles of the meromorphically continued resolvents of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We extend this result to classical locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature with convex-cocompact fundamental group using results of Bunke and Olbrich. The method of proof forces us to exclude the spectral parameters corresponding to singular Poisson transforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between large N instantons and conventional instantons, focusing on matrix models and topological strings. We show that the resurgent properties of the perturbative series at fixed but arbitrary N, including the replica limit N = 0, can be obtained from large N instantons. In the case of topological strings, it has been conjectured that the resurgent structure encoded by large N instantons is closely related to the spectrum of BPS states. We give direct evidence for this connection in the case of Seiberg-Witten theory and other topological string models, and we show in detail how the resurgent properties at fixed N follow from the large N theory, and therefore can be used to obtain information on BPS invariants.</description>

      <title>Linearized Boltzmann collision operator for a mixture of monatomic and polyatomic chemically reacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At higher altitudes, for high temperature gases, for instance near space shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least) uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of the linearized collision operator are obtained</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the three-dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric dual gauge theories on $S_b^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$ in the context of the gauge/YBE correspondence. We consider hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities acquired via the equality of supersymmetric lens partition functions as solutions to the decoration transformation and the flipping relation in statistical mechanics. The solutions of those transformations aim at investigating various decorated lattice models possessing the Boltzmann weights of integrable Ising-like models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. We also constructed The Bailey pairs for the decoration transformation and the flipping relation.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems. Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena is that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- "phases" of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them \emph{glasses} and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as the new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Oldroyd B fluid model is the Eulerian form of a Lagrangian model with an internal variable that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics under some conditions on the initial value of the internal variable. We similarly derive several new nonlinear versions of the Oldroyd B model as well as Lagrangian formulations of the Zaremba-Jaumann and Oldroyd A fluid models. We discuss whether or not these other models satisfy the second law.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we describe the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a degenerate Fermi gas, at zero temperature. First, we analyze the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Mean eigenvector self-overlap in the real and complex elliptic Ginibre ensembles at strong and weak non-Hermiticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mean diagonal overlap of left and right eigenvectors associated with complex eigenvalues in $N\times N$ non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices. In well known works by Chalker and Mehlig the expectation of this (self-)overlap was computed for the complex Ginibre ensemble as $N\to \infty$. In the present work, we consider the same quantity in the real and complex elliptic Ginibre ensembles characterized by correlations between off-diagonal entries controlled by a parameter $\tau\in[0,1]$, with $\tau=1$ corresponding to the Hermitian limit. We derive exact expressions for the mean diagonal overlap in both ensembles at any finite $N$, for any eigenvalue off the real axis. We further investigate several scaling regimes as $N\rightarrow \infty$, both in the limit of strong non-Hermiticity keeping a fixed $\tau\in[0,1)$ and in the weak non-Hermiticity limit, with $\tau$ approaching unity in such a way that $N(1-\tau)$ remains finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.08755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the fundamental thermodynamic equation for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein quantum gases, which contains the first order contribution due to the quantum nature of the gas particles. Then, we analyze the fundamental equation in the context of geometrothermodynamics. Although the corresponding Hamiltonian does not contain a potential, indicating the lack of classical thermodynamic interaction, we show that the curvature of the equilibrium space is non-zero and can be interpreted as a measure of the effective quantum interaction between the gas particles. In the limiting case of a classical Boltzmann gas, we show that the equilibrium space becomes flat, as expected from the physical viewpoint. In addition, we derive a thermodynamic fundamental equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation and, using the Ehrenfest scheme, we show that it can be considered as a first order phase transition which in the equilibrium space corresponds to a curvature singularity. This result indicates that the curvature of the equilibrium space can be used to measure in an invariant way the thermodynamic interaction in classical and quantum ideal gases.</description>

      <title>On Bethe equations of 2d conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the higher spin algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theory from the perspective of quantum integrability. Starting from Maulik-Okounkov instanton R-matrix and applying the procedure of algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain infinite commuting families of Hamiltonians of quantum ILW hierarchy parametrized by the shape of the auxiliary torus. We calculate explicitly the first five of these Hamiltonians. Then, we numerically verify that their joint spectrum can be parametrized by solutions of Litvinov's Bethe ansatz equations and we conjecture a general formula for the joint spectrum of all ILW Hamiltonians, based on results of Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin.
  There are two interesting degeneration limits, the infinitely thick and the infinitely thin auxiliary torus. In one of these limits, the ILW hierarchy degenerates to Yangian or Benjamin-Ono hierarchy and the Bethe equations can be easily solved. The other limit is singular but we can nevertheless extract local Hamiltonians corresponding to quantum KdV or KP hierarchy. Litvinov's Bethe equations in this local limit provide an alternative to Bethe ansatz equations of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, but are more transparent, work at any rank and are manifestly symmetric under triality symmetry of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, we illustrate analytic properties of the solutions of Bethe equations in minimal models, in particular for Lee-Yang CFT. The analytic structure of Bethe roots is very rich as it captures the representation theory of $\mathcal{W}_N$ minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature. This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$ models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting with refractory periods: pathway formulation and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look into the problem of stochastic resetting with refractory periods. The model dynamics comprises diffusive and motionless phases. The diffusive phase ends at random time instants, at which the system is reset to a given position -- where the system remains at rest for a random time interval, termed the refractory period. A pathway formulation is introduced to derive exact analytical results for the relevant observables in a broad framework, with the resetting time and the refractory period following arbitrary distributions. For the paradigmatic case of Poissonian distributions of the resetting and refractory times, in general with different characteristic rates, closed-form expressions are obtained that successfully describe the relaxation to the steady state. Finally, we focus on the single-target search problem, in which the survival probability and the mean first passage time to the target can be exactly computed. Therein, we also discuss optimal strategies, which show a non-trivial dependence on the refractory period.</description>

      <title>The Widom-Sobolev formula for discontinuous matrix-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Widom-Sobolev formula for the asymptotic behaviour of truncated Wiener-Hopf operators with discontinuous matrix-valued symbols for three different classes of test functions. The symbols may depend on both position and momentum except when closing the asymptotics for twice differentiable test functions with H\"older singularities. The cut-off domains are allowed to have piecewise differentiable boundaries. In contrast to the case where the symbol is smooth in one variable, the resulting coefficient in the enhanced area law we obtain here remains as explicit for matrix-valued symbols as it is for scalar-valued symbols.</description>

      <title>There is no 'velocity kick' memory in electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory effect in electrodynamics, as discovered in 1981 by Staruszkiewicz, and also analysed later, consists of adiabatic shift of the position of a test particle. The proposed 'velocity kick' memory effect, supposedly discovered recently, is in contradiction to these findings. We show that the 'velocity kick' memory is an artefact resulting from an unjustified interchange of limits. This example is a warning against drawing uncritical conclusions for spacetime fields, from their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>On Some Quantum Correction to the Coulomb Potential in Generalized Uncertainty Principle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking into account the importance of the unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity, and the existence of a minimal length of the order of the Planck scale, we consider a modified Schr\"odinger equation resulting from a generalized uncertainty principle, which finds applications from the realm of quantum information to large-scale physics, with a quantum mechanically corrected gravitational interaction proposed very recently. As the resulting equation cannot be solved by common exact approaches, we propose a Bethe ansatz approach, which will be applied and whose results we will discuss, commenting on the analogy of the present study with some other interesting physical problems.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Condition for Some Isomonodromy Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a special class of Jimbo-Miwa-Mori-Sato isomonodromy equations, which can be seen as a higher-dimensional generalization of Painlev\'e VI. We first construct its convergent $n\times n$ matrix series solutions satisfying certain boundary condition. We then use the Riemann-Hilbert approach to prove that the resulting solutions are almost all the solutions. Along the way, we find a shrinking phenomenon of the eigenvalues of the submatrices of the generic matrix solutions in the long time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a C$^*$-algebra $A$ with an almost periodic time evolution $\sigma$, we define a new C$^*$-algebra $A_c$, which we call the crystal of $(A,\sigma)$, that represents the zero temperature limit of $(A, \sigma)$. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ground states of $(A,\sigma)$ and the states on $A_c$, justifying the name. In order to investigate further the relation between low temperature equilibrium states on $A$ and traces on $A_c$, we define a Fock module $\mathcal F$ over the crystal and construct a vacuum representation of $A$ on $\mathcal F$. This allows us to show, under relatively mild assumptions, that for sufficiently large inverse temperatures $\beta$ the $\sigma$-KMS$_\beta$-states on $A$ are induced from traces on $A_c$ by means of the Fock module. In the second part, we compare the K-theoretic structures of $A$ and $A_c$. Previous work by various authors suggests that they have (rationally) isomorphic K-groups. We analyze this phenomenon in detail, confirming it under favorable conditions, but showing that, in general, there is apparently no easy way to relate these groups. As examples, we discuss in particular Exel's results on semi-saturated circle actions, and recent results of Miller on the K-theory of inverse semigroup C$^*$-algebras. In relation to the latter, we introduce the notion of a scale $N$ on an inverse semigroup $I$ and define a new inverse semigroup $I_c$, which we call the crystal of $(I,N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an algebraic condition on any $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive definite matrix which is necessary and sufficient for the matrix to be diagonalized by an orthosymplectic matrix in the sense of Williamson's theorem.</description>
