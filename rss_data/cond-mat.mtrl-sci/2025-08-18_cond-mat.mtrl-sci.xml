      <title>Tunable optical emissions of Eu3+ ions enabled by pressure-driven phase transition in ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the optical properties of rare-earth ions in wide-bandgap semiconductors remains a major challenge in the development of next-generation photonic materials. Here, we show that external hydrostatic pressure modulates the structural characteristics of ZnO thin films and, in turn, tunes the optical emission behavior of embedded Eu3+ ions. By combining in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy under high-pressure conditions with first-principles calculations, we capture a pressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal wurtzite to the cubic rocksalt structure near 10 GPa. This transformation is accompanied by complete quenching of the D0 - FJ Europium emissions near the transition threshold, followed by a partial recovery at higher pressures, likely associated with the emergence of structural disorder. Concurrently, the Stark components of the emission bands exhibit a redshift and significant broadening with increasing pressure, reflecting enhanced crystal field strength as interatomic distances decrease. Additional first-principles calculations support the observed pressure-induced shifts in the Eu-4f states and emphasize the influence of lattice symmetry on their electronic environment. These results show that hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to adjust the optical emissions of rare-earth ions by changing their symmetry and local environment, providing a basis for designing photonic devices and luminescent materials controlled by pressure.</description>

      <title>Electron Ptychography Images Hydrogen Atom Superlattices and 3D Inhomogeneities in Palladium Hydride Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When hydrogen atoms occupy interstitial sites in metal lattices, they form metal hydrides (MHx), whose structural and electronic properties can differ significantly from the host metals. Owing to the small size of hydrogen atom and its unique interactions with the host metal, MHx is of broad interest in both fundamental science and technological applications. Determining where the hydrogen is located within the MHx, and whether it orders on the partially occupied interstitial sites is crucial for predicting and understanding the resultant physical and electronic properties of the hydride. Directly imaging hydrogen within a host material remains a major challenge due to its weak interaction with X-rays and electrons in conventional imaging techniques. Here, we employ electron ptychography, a scanning transmission electron microscopy technique, to image the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of H atoms in Palladium hydrides (PdHx) nanocubes, one of the most studied and industrially relevant MHx materials. We observe an unexpected one-dimensional superlattice ordering of hydrogen within the PdHx nanocubes and 3D hydrogen clustering in localized regions within PdHx nanocubes, revealing spatial heterogeneity in metal hydride nanoparticles previously inaccessible by other methods.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Fourier Structure of Wavefunctions in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry dictates the physical properties of materials. The symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the set of points, lines, and planes over which sets of planewaves are degenerate, upon which atomic symmetry determines the interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the BZ, except in the vicinity of the removed degeneracies. As optical transitions between any two planewaves are forbidden, only regions of the Brillouin zone (BZ) near these lifted degeneracies contribute to optical properties. Application to optical response of Si and other semiconductors reveals that a single band transition, with only two planewaves, well describes their dielectric properties. Further, it provides a framework to understand non-linear optical response which is demonstrated to arise from higher order degeneracy existing along high symmetry lines/points of the BZ.</description>

      <title>Metallic Contact Contributions in Thermal Hall Conductivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of metallic contacts on thermal Hall measurements. By analyzing typical measurement configurations, we demonstrate that heat currents bypassing through metallic contacts can generate non-negligible thermal Hall signals, even when the actual thermal Hall conductivity of a measured insulator is zero. We show that the effect predicts thermal Hall conductivities that compare favorably with actual experimental observations across a variety of materials, reproducing both their temperature dependencies and magnitudes by assuming effective contact thicknesses on the order of 10$^{-2}$ of sample widths. It even reproduces the subtle differences in temperature dependencies between materials with high and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. Our study suggests the necessity of suppressing the bypass heat currents in thermal Hall measurements, which can be achieved by properly arranging the measurement configurations.</description>

      <title>Atomistic spin dynamics with quantum colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of temperature-dependent magnetization dynamics is a fundamental challenge in computational magnetism. While Atomistic Spin Dynamics (ASD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for studying magnetic phenomena, their classical nature leads to significant deviations from experimental observations, particularly at low temperatures. Here we present a comprehensive implementation of quantum-corrected ASD into the Vampire software package, based on the open-system Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a quantum thermostat. Our implementation incorporates memory effects along with colored noise derived from quantum-mechanical considerations that improve the description of the equilibrium magnetization. We demonstrate excellent quantitative agreement with experimental magnetization curves for nickel and gadolinium across the full temperature range. Our results establish that incorporating quantum environmental effects and colored noise substantially enhances the predictive capabilities of ASD simulations, providing a robust framework for modeling temperature-dependent magnetic phenomena in localized moment magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced anomalous Hall conductivity via Ga doping in Mn\textsubscript{3}Sn and Mn\textsubscript{3}Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the Heusler series \ce{Mn3Z} (Z=Ga, Ge, Sn), with a particular emphasis on the manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnetic structures to enhance AHE. By employing density-functional theory and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the anomalous Hall conductivity is markedly responsive to electron filling. By strategically doping Ga into \ce{Mn3Sn} and \ce{Mn3Ge} in order to modulate the electron density, a significant increase in anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is achieved. It is noteworthy that a Ga:Sn ratio of 1:5 yields peak AHC values exceeding $\mathrm{700(\Omega \cdot cm)^{-1}}$, while 3:7 Ga-Ge ratios can result in AHC values surpassing $600\mathrm{(\Omega \cdot cm)^{-1}}$. A comparison between the virtual crystal approximation and supercell construction methods for doping has revealed consistent trends. The results of this study pave the way for optimizing AHE in non-collinear AFM materials.</description>

      <title>Hole doping as an efficient route to increase the Curie temperature in monolayer CrI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnets offer unprecedented opportunities to control magnetism at the atomic scale. Through charge carrier doping - realized by electrostatic gating, intercalation/adsorption, or interfacial charge transfer - one can efficiently tune exchange interactions and spin-orbit-induced effects in these systems. In this work, through a multi-scale theoretical framework combining density functional theory, spin Hamiltonian modeling, and Wannier-function analysis, we choose monolayer CrI$_3$ to unravel how carrier doping affects the isotropic as well as anisotropic exchange interactions in this prototypical vdW ferromagnet. The remarkable efficiency of hole doping in enhancing ferromagnetic exchange and magnetic anisotropy found in our study was explained through orbital-resolved analysis. Crucially, we demonstrated that unlike the undoped system - where isotropic exchange interactions govern magnetic long-range order - the hole-doped CrI$_3$ exhibits anisotropic terms comparable in magnitude to isotropic ones. Finally, we show that a high concentration of holes in a CrI$_3$ monolayer can increase its Curie temperature above 200 K. This work advances our understanding of doping-controlled magnetism in semiconducting 2D materials, demonstrating how anisotropy engineering can stabilize high-temperature magnetic order.</description>

      <title>The contribution of electron and hole conductivity to the transport loss in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective conductivity determines the reciprocal of the transport resistance, the dominant loss of fill factor in organic solar cells. We experimentally determine the dependence of effective conductivity on its electron and hole contributions. Using PM6:Y12 blends with tunable morphological and energetic disorder, we show that the effective conductivity follows a harmonic mean of electron and hole conductivities even across nearly three orders of magnitude in conductivity imbalance. We also validate the method for directly extracting effective conductivity from current-voltage measurements, eliminating the need to rely on indirect mobility and charge carrier density-based proxies. Our findings challenge the widespread use of geometric mean approximations and offer a more accurate framework for analysing and modelling transport in disordered organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast X-ray interaction with photovoltaic materials: Thermal and nonthermal responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) are important in various electronic technologies, for which laser irradiation is used to selectively modify and design their unique semiconductor properties. We employ the hybrid multiscale code XTANT-3 to simulate the kinetics of material response to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The code accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials show nonthermal melting at higher doses. Threshold doses increase further if energy sinks and recrystallization are included. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the cooled state becomes more amorphous, reducing the band gap until it stabilizes. Curiously, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibit transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. The results suggest that femtosecond lasers may be used for tuning the band gap of photovoltaic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in atom-intercalated quaternary hydrides under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich materials are the most promising candidates for high-temperature conventional superconductors under ambient pressure. Multinary hydrides have abundant structural configurations and are more promising to find high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure, but searching for multinary materials in complex phase space is a great challenge. In this work, we used our developed AI search engine (InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. Several quaternary hydrides with high superconducting temperature~($T_c$) are predicted. In particular, the superconducting $T_c$ of K$_2$GaCuH$_6$ and K$_2$LiCuH$_6$ are calculated to be 68~K and 53~K under ambient pressure, respectively, which shows a significant enhancement in comparison with that of K$_2$CuH$_6$~($T_c$ $\sim$ 16~K). We also find that intercalating atoms could cause phonon softening and induce more phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling. Hence, we propose that intercalating atoms is a feasible approach in searching for superconducting quaternary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Interactive framework for techno-economic meta-analysis of marine hydrogen transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a result of the wide span of uncertainties and input variables considered in recent peer-reviewed studies on hydrogen supply chains, consensus and generalized insight are hard to derive. This work presents a meta-analysis model, building upon a growing database of literature cost estimations and enabling dynamic investigation and comparison of hydrogen transportation chains under varying input scenarios. Also built into the framework is the evaluation of the impact of costing methodology and shipping fuel type. A convenient online interface allows to leverage increasing amounts of underlying cost data and assists users in gaining insight into generalized cost dynamics attributes. The method and toolbox are demonstrated via in-depth analysis of compressed hydrogen (GH2), liquefied hydrogen (LH2), dibenzyltoluene (LOHC) and ammonia as hydrogen carriers. Confined hydrogen clathrate hydrates are used as an example to demonstrate how one can deal with lower-TRL candidate technologies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Compaction Behavior of Textile Reinforcements in Low-Resolution In-Situ CT Scans via Machine-Learning and Descriptor-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting -- characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance. This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT). In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of 50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822 and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based structural analysis of composite preforms.</description>

      <title>Developing and Validating a High-Throughput Robotic System for the Accelerated Development of Porous Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency. Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through NIPS.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in Graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Unphysical Solutions in Coupled-Cluster-Based Random Phase Approximation and How to Avoid Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD)-based random phase approximation (RPA) has provided an attractive framework for the development and application of RPA-related methods. However, a potential unphysical solution issue recently reported by Rekkedal and co-workers (J. Chem. Phys. 139, 081101, 2013) has raised significant concerns regarding the general applicability of coupled-cluster-based RPA, particularly in small-gap systems where RPA is anticipated to outperform commonly employed second-order perturbation theory. In this work, we elucidate the underlying origin of the multi-solution issue in drCCD and develop both a practical criterion for validating drCCD solutions and improved preconditioners based on level shifting and regularized MP2 methods for stabilizing the iterative solution of the drCCD equation. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach through representative systems -- including molecules with stretched bonds, large conjugated systems, and metallic clusters -- where standard drCCD iteration encounters convergence difficulties. Furthermore, we extend our approach to various recently developed reduced-scaling drCCD-based RPA methods, thereby establishing a foundation for their stable application to large-scale problems. The extension of our approach to RPA with exchange, quasiparticle RPA, and particle-particle RPA is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Atomic perspective on the topological magnetism in kagome metal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials with kagome lattices have attracted intense interest due to their unconventional electronic structures, which exhibit nontrivial topology, anomalous magnetism, and electronic correlations. Among these, Co3Sn2S2 stands out as a prototypical kagome metal, uniquely combining intrinsic ferromagnetism with topologically nontrivial electronic states. This perspective presents a systematic overview of recent advances in studying kagome metal Co3Sn2S2 achieved through scanning tunneling microscopy. We begin by introducing different methodologies for surface identification and propose using designer layer-selective chemical markers for conclusive surface identification. We then discuss the Berry curvature induced flat band orbital magnetism and the associated unconventional Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we explore boundary states arising from Weyl topology and analyze challenges in detecting Fermi arcs via quasiparticle interference patterns and in uncovering the topological aspect of the edge states. Finally, we review recent observations of spin-orbit-coupled quantum impurity states through spin-polarized tunneling spectroscopy, as well as their connection to Weyl topology and flat band magnetism. We also provide in-depth analysis and constructive comments on the limitations of the current research approach. This review highlights the critical role of scanning tunneling microscopy in unraveling the intricate interplay between topology, magnetism, and correlations at the atomic scale, and the methodology discussed here can be applied to study other topological quantum materials in general.</description>

      <title>Tilted Material in an Optical Cavity: Light-Matter Moir\'e Effect and Coherent Frequency Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and theoretically characterize a light-matter moir\'e effect (LMME) that arises when a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to stacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moir\'e hetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent periodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the polariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through time-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables coherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced decoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering polariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent frequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A 3D porous MXene/PNIPAAm hydrogel composite with advanced degradation stability and control of electronic properties in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reports the fundamental investigation of a novel composite material consisting of MXene (Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$) and a stimulus-responsive hydrogel (Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) - PNIPAAm). In contrast to previously reported integration of MXene and hydrogels, the material described here offers a tunable porous structure for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing that maintains its stability and responsiveness in any kind of gaseous environment and in a dried state. Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and more efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites. The presented study focuses on a fundamental investigation of the synthesized MXene/PNIPAAm composite's properties. Thereby, the fabrication and comparison of pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly porous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect to: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of the prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced degradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of three months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas interactions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron microscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical properties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of electrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC sensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone. These investigations reveal fundamentally novel material effects and properties that address some of the key MXene-related challenges. Additionally, the interplay between the MXene and the hydrogel enables unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the sensing potential of stimulus-responsive hydrogels, specifically in gaseous environments.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge-current conversion in altermagnetic candidate RuO$_2$ probed by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the THz emission spectroscopy, we investigate ultrafast spin-to-charge current conversion in epitaxial thin films of the altermagnetic candidate RuO$_2$. We perform a quantitative analysis of competing effects that can contribute to the measured anisotropic THz emission. These include the anisotropic inverse spin splitter and spin Hall effects in RuO$_2$, the anisotropic conductivity of RuO$_2$, and the birefringence of the TiO$_2$ substrate. We observe that the leading contribution to the measured signals comes from the anisotropic inverse spin Hall effect, with an average spin-Hall angle of $2.4\times 10^{-3}$ at room temperature. In comparison, a possible contribution from the altermagnetic inverse spin-splitter effect is found to be below $2\times 10^{-4}$. Our work stresses the importance of carefully disentangling spin-dependent phenomena that can be generated by the unconventional altermagnetic order, from the effects of the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Low barrier ZrO$_x$-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson junction is a crucial element in superconducting devices, and niobium is a promising candidate for the superconducting material due to its large energy gap relative to aluminum. AlO$_x$ has long been regarded as the highest quality oxide tunnel barrier and is often used in niobium-based junctions. Here we propose ZrO$_x$ as an alternative tunnel barrier material for Nb electrodes. We theoretically estimate that zirconium oxide has excellent oxygen retention properties and experimentally verify that there is no significant oxygen diffusion leading to NbO$_x$ formation in the adjacent Nb electrode. We develop a top-down, subtractive fabrication process for Nb/Zr-ZrO$_x$/Nb Josephson junctions, which enables scalability and large-scale production of superconducting electronics. Using cross sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, we experimentally find that depending on the Zr thickness, ZrO$_x$ tunnel barriers can be fully crystalline with chemically abrupt interfaces with niobium. Further analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals that ZrO$_x$ corresponds to tetragonal ZrO$_2$. Room temperature characterization of fabricated junctions using Simmons' model shows that ZrO$_2$ exhibits a low tunnel barrier height, which is promising in merged-element transmon applications. Low temperature transport measurements reveal sub-gap structure, while the low-voltage sub-gap resistance remains in the megaohm range.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator nano-SQUID: Flux-tunable platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in the Superconductor NiBi$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NiBi$_{3}$ compound exhibits a compelling interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, further enriched by topological characteristics that make it an exceptional platform for exploring emergent electronic phenomena. Here, we report experimental evidence of unconventional magnetic phenomena in high-quality single crystals of NiBi$_3$, revealed through detailed magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistance displays a non-usual temperature dependence, featuring both a classical Lorentz-like component and a linear-in-field contribution. In addition, anomalous Hall effect signal persist down to the superconducting transition temperature and vanish above 75 K. These observations suggest that magnetic fluctuations play a significant role in charge transport in NiBi$_{3}$, highlighting a magnetically and topologically intertwined electronic structure. Our findings underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of this material.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Small-Angle Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Spheres using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning approach for analyzing the scattering function of the polydisperse hard spheres system. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the bidirectional mapping between the scattering function and the system parameters including the volume fraction and polydispersity. Such that the trained model serves both as a generator that produce scattering function from the system parameters, and an inferrer that extract system parameters from the scattering function. We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then we split the dataset into training and testing set and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produce scattering function with significant higher accuracy comparing to the traditional Percus-Yevick approximation and $\beta$ correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.</description>
