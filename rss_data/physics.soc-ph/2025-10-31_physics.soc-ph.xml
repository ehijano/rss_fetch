      <title>Emergence, Evolution and Manipulation of Swing Voters in Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political polarization, fueled by public discourse and echo chambers, threatens the foundation of democratic elections. However, traditional one-dimensional opinion models -- assuming ``support for one party equals opposition to another'' -- fail to capture the nuanced dynamics of swing voters (including neutrals, left leaners and right leaners), who are critical for the final election outcomes. This study introduces a two-dimensional opinion model that classifies voters into five groups, enabling precise characterization of the swing group's interactive behaviors. Importantly, we introduce antagonism effect to describe the intensities with which the two camps incite opposition and exert voting pressure in the run-up to the election, typically via Us-versus-Them framing. By integrating the open-mindedness of voters, the stubbornness of opinion interactions, and the antagonism effect manipulated by the two parties, we systematically explore the intricate interplay between top-down political campaigns and bottom-up interpersonal opinion dynamics, unveiling their nonlinear coupling impacts on the emergence, and evolution of swing voters. Counterintuitively, we find that extreme antagonism effects might backfire in presidential election: when both parties adopt intense antagonistic strategies, the party that polarizes more strongly risks alienating swing voters, thereby enabling its ostensibly weaker opponent to prevail. These insights are also validated on the core retweet networks during 2020 U.S. presidential election. Building upon multidimensional opinion model, our results highlight the possibility of manipulating swing voters and shaping electoral outcomes through antagonistic strategies of political parties. Our work also provides a nuanced and generalizable framework for analyzing opinion dynamics in other polarized public discourse.</description>

      <title>Life-cycle Modeling and the Walking Behavior of the Pedestrian-Group as an Emergent Agent: With Empirical Data on the Cohesion of the Group Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.</description>

      <title>Proxemics and Permeability of the Pedestrian Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone. People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief periods of time.</description>

      <title>World personal income distribution evolution measured by purchasing power parity exchange rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of global income distribution from 1988 to 2018 is analyzed using purchasing power parity exchange rates and well-established statistical distributions. This research proposes the use of two separate distributions to more accurately represent the overall data, rather than relying on a single distribution. The global income distribution was fitted to log-normal and gamma functions, which are standard tools in econophysics. Despite limitations in data completeness during the early years, the available information covered the vast majority of the world's population. Probability density function (PDF) curves enabled the identification of key peaks in the distribution, while complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves highlighted general trends in inequality. Initially, the global income distribution exhibited a bimodal pattern; however, the growth of middle classes in highly populated countries such as China and India has driven the transition to a unimodal distribution in recent years. While single-function fits with gamma or log-normal distributions provided reasonable accuracy, the bimodal approach constructed as a sum of log-normal distributions yielded near-perfect fits.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of realistic scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>
