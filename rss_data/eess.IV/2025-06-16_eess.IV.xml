      <title>Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids -- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at https://github.com/voilalab/INR-benchmark.</description>

      <title>ADAgent: LLM Agent for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis with Collaborative Coordinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However, most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks, process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.</description>

      <title>Vector Representations of Vessel Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to 3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree structures in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>DiffPR: Diffusion-Based Phase Reconstruction via Frequency-Decoupled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder. Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage 1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits conventional phase-retrieval networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however, datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.</description>

      <title>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) with Bias-Switchable Row-Column Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as bias-switchable row-column arrays (RCAs), allow for imaging techniques otherwise impossible for non-bias-switachable RCAs. Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) is a novel imaging technique that allows for expansive 3D scanning by transmitting plane or cylindrical wavefronts and receiving using Hadamard-Encoded-Read-Out (HERO) to perform beamforming on what is effectively a full 2D synthetic receive aperture. This allows imaging beyond the shadow of the aperture of the RCA array, potentially allows for whole organ imaging and 3D visualization of tissue morphology. It additionally enables view large volumes through limited windows. In this work we demonstrated with simulation that we are able to image at comparable resolution to existing RCA imaging methods at hundreds of frames per second. We validated these simulations by demonstrating an experimental implementation of HERCULES using a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and a research ultrasound system. Furthermore, we assess our imaging capabilities by imaging a commercial phantom, and comparing our results to those taken with traditional RCA imaging methods. Finally, we verified our ability to image real tissue by imaging a xenograft mouse model.</description>

      <title>FAD-Net: Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation using Invasive Coronary Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making. Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA) mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation. Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717 in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.</description>

      <title>Taming Stable Diffusion for Computed Tomography Blind Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>FCA2: Frame Compression-Aware Autoencoder for Modular and Fast Compressed Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods, which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR) demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing, the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/handsomewzy/FCA2.</description>

      <title>Brain Network Analysis Based on Fine-tuned Self-supervised Model for Brain Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effectiveness of Deep Features from Domain-Specific Foundation Models in Retinal Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However, unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging, which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.</description>

      <title>Framework of a multiscale data-driven digital twin of the muscle-skeletal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide, requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging, electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design. Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/eezkni/SSIU</description>

      <title>3D Skin Segmentation Methods in Medical Imaging: A Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is critical in medical image analysis, aiding diagnostics and treatment planning. Skin segmentation plays a key role in registering and visualising multimodal imaging data. 3D skin segmentation enables applications in personalised medicine, surgical planning, and remote monitoring, offering realistic patient models for treatment simulation, procedural visualisation, and continuous condition tracking. This paper analyses and compares algorithmic and AI-driven skin segmentation approaches, emphasising key factors to consider when selecting a strategy based on data availability and application requirements. We evaluate an iterative region-growing algorithm and the TotalSegmentator, a deep learning-based approach, across different imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Our tests show that AI segmentation excels in automation but struggles with MRI due to its CT-based training, while the graphics-based method performs better for MRIs but introduces more noise. AI-driven segmentation also automates patient bed removal in CT, whereas the graphics-based method requires manual intervention.</description>

      <title>MindGrab for BrainChop: Fast and Accurate Skull Stripping for Command Line and Browser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P &lt; 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P &lt; 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352), MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested scenarios, with minor differences (&lt;3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli (https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.</description>

      <title>crossMoDA Challenge: Evolution of Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation Techniques for Vestibular Schwannoma and Cochlea Segmentation from 2021 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA, while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo</description>

      <title>ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D &amp; 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly available.</description>

      <title>JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

      <title>FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.</description>

      <title>HyBiomass: Global Hyperspectral Imagery Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Geospatial Foundation Models in Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However, most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The dataset and source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>EyeSim-VQA: A Free-Energy-Guided Eye Simulation Framework for Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues, we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved interpretability through its biologically grounded design.</description>

      <title>HoToPy: A toolbox for X-ray holo-tomography in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Python toolbox for holographic and tomographic X-ray imaging. It comprises a collection of phase retrieval algorithms for the deeply holographic and direct contrast imaging regimes, including non-linear approaches and extended choices of regularization, constraint sets, and optimizers, all implemented with a unified and intuitive interface. Moreover, it features auxiliary functions for (tomographic) alignment, image processing, and simulation of imaging experiments. The capability of the toolbox is illustrated by the example of a catalytic nanoparticle, imaged in the deeply holographic regime at the 'GINIX' instrument of the P10 beamline at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg). Due to its modular design, the toolbox can be used for algorithmic development and benchmarking in a lean and flexible manner, or be interfaced and integrated in the reconstruction pipeline of other synchrotron or XFEL instruments for phase imaging based on propagation.</description>

Abstract: Remote sensing has emerged as a critical tool for large-scale Earth monitoring and land management. In this paper, we introduce AgriPotential, a novel benchmark dataset composed of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery spanning multiple months. The dataset provides pixel-level annotations of agricultural potentials for three major crop types - viticulture, market gardening, and field crops - across five ordinal classes. AgriPotential supports a broad range of machine learning tasks, including ordinal regression, multi-label classification, and spatio-temporal modeling. The data covers diverse areas in Southern France, offering rich spectral information. AgriPotential is the first public dataset designed specifically for agricultural potential prediction, aiming to improve data-driven approaches to sustainable land use planning.

      <title>DiffFuSR: Super-Resolution of all Sentinel-2 Multispectral Bands using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency, spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models can be found at https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/DiffFuSR.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source, synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency, (de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Electrocardiography Noise Quantification via Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability, supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and wearable ECG applications.</description>

      <title>Methods for evaluating the resolution of 3D data derived from satellite images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D data derived from satellite images is essential for scene modeling applications requiring large-scale coverage or involving locations not accessible by airborne lidar or cameras. Measuring the resolution of this data is important for determining mission utility and tracking improvements. In this work, we consider methods to evaluate the resolution of point clouds, digital surface models, and 3D mesh models. We describe 3D metric evaluation tools and workflows that enable automated evaluation based on high-resolution reference airborne lidar, and we present results of analyses with data of varying quality.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised training of deep denoisers in multi-coil MRI considering noise correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based denoising methods have shown powerful results for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of magnetic resonance (MR) images, mostly by leveraging supervised learning with clean ground truth. However, acquiring clean ground truth images is often expensive and time-consuming. Self supervised methods have been widely investigated to mitigate the dependency on clean images, but mostly rely on the suboptimal splitting of K-space measurements of an image to yield input and target images for ensuring statistical independence. In this study, we investigate an alternative self-supervised training method for deep denoisers in multi-coil MRI, dubbed Coil2Coil (C2C), that naturally split and combine the multi-coil data among phased array coils, generating two noise-corrupted images for training. This novel approach allows exploiting multi-coil redundancy, but the images are statistically correlated and may not have the same clean image. To mitigate these issues, we propose the methods to pproximately decorrelate the statistical dependence of these images and match the underlying clean images, thus enabling them to be used as the training pairs. For synthetic denoising experiments, C2C yielded the best performance against prior self-supervised methods, reporting outcome comparable even to supervised methods. For real-world denoising cases, C2C yielded consistent performance as synthetic cases, removing only noise structures.</description>

      <title>We Care Each Pixel: Calibrating on Medical Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for computer-aided diagnostics, providing accurate delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions. While common metrics such as Accuracy, DSC, IoU, and HD primarily quantify spatial agreement between predictions and ground-truth labels, they do not assess the calibration quality of segmentation models, which is crucial for clinical reliability. To address this limitation, we propose pixel-wise Expected Calibration Error (pECE), a novel metric that explicitly measures miscalibration at the pixel level, thereby ensuring both spatial precision and confidence reliability. We further introduce a morphological adaptation strategy that applies morphological operations to ground-truth masks before computing calibration losses, particularly benefiting margin-based losses such as Margin SVLS and NACL. Additionally, we present the Signed Distance Calibration Loss (SDC), which aligns boundary geometry with calibration objectives by penalizing discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth signed distance functions (SDFs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only enhances segmentation performance but also improves calibration quality, yielding more trustworthy confidence estimates. Code is available at: https://github.com/EagleAdelaide/SDC-Loss.</description>

      <title>seg2med: a bridge from artificial anatomy to multimodal medical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present seg2med, a modular framework for anatomy-driven multimodal medical image synthesis. The system integrates three components to enable high-fidelity, cross-modality generation of CT and MR images based on structured anatomical priors. First, anatomical maps are independently derived from three sources: real patient data, XCAT digital phantoms, and synthetic anatomies created by combining organs from multiple patients. Second, we introduce PhysioSynth, a modality-specific simulator that converts anatomical masks into prior volumes using tissue-dependent parameters (e.g., HU, T1, T2, proton density) and modality-specific signal models. It supports simulation of CT and multiple MR sequences including GRE, SPACE, and VIBE. Third, the synthesized anatomical priors are used to train 2-channel conditional denoising diffusion models, which take the anatomical prior as structural condition alongside the noisy image, enabling generation of high-quality, structurally aligned images. The framework achieves SSIM of 0.94 for CT and 0.89 for MR compared to real data, and FSIM of 0.78 for simulated CT. The generative quality is further supported by a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for CT synthesis. In modality conversion, seg2med achieves SSIM of 0.91 for MR to CT and 0.77 for CT to MR. Anatomical fidelity evaluation shows synthetic CT achieves mean Dice scores above 0.90 for 11 key abdominal organs, and above 0.80 for 34 of 59 total organs. These results underscore seg2med's utility in cross-modality synthesis, data augmentation, and anatomy-aware medical AI.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</description>

      <title>The Iris File Extension</title>

Abstract: A modern digital pathology vendor-agnostic binary slide format specifically targeting the unmet need of efficient real-time transfer and display has not yet been established. The growing adoption of digital pathology only intensifies the need for an intermediary digital slide format that emphasizes performance for use between slide servers and image management software. The DICOM standard is a well-established format widely used for the long-term storage of both images and associated critical metadata. However, it was inherently designed for radiology rather than digital pathology, a discipline that imposes a unique set of performance requirements due to high-speed multi-pyramidal rendering within whole slide viewer applications. Here we introduce the Iris file extension, a binary container specification explicitly designed for performance-oriented whole slide image viewer systems. The Iris file extension specification is explicit and straightforward, adding modern compression support, a dynamic structure with fully optional metadata features, computationally trivial deep file validation, corruption recovery capabilities, and slide annotations. In addition to the file specification document, we provide source code to allow for (de)serialization and validation of a binary stream against the standard. We also provide corresponding binary builds with C++, Python, and JavaScript language support. Finally, we provide full encoder and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds (part of the separate Iris Codec Community module), with language bindings for C++ and Python, allowing for easy integration with existing WSI solutions. We provide the Iris File Extension specification openly to the community in the form of a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative 4.0 International license.</description>
