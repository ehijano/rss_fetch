      <title>Trial Length, Pricing, and Rationally Inattentive Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "free trial" followed by automatic renewal is a dominant business model in the digital economy. Standard models explain trials as a mechanism for consumers to learn their valuation for a product. We propose a complementary theory based on the rational inattention framework. Consumers know their valuation but face a cognitive cost to remember to cancel an unwanted subscription. We model this using a Shannon entropy-based cost of information processing, where a consumer's baseline attention level decays with the length of the trial period. This creates a novel trade-off for a monopolist firm: a longer trial increases "inattentive revenue" from consumers who fail to cancel, but it also lowers ex-ante consumer utility, making the initial offer less attractive. We show that this trade-off leads to an interior optimal trial length, even for products where value-learning is instantaneous. Our model, under standard assumptions about demand elasticity and the distribution of consumer valuations, generates sharp, testable predictions about the relationship between contract terms. We find that the optimal renewal price and trial length are complements: firms offering longer trials will also set higher post-trial prices. We analyze the impact of policies aimed at curbing consumer exploitation, such as "click-to-cancel" regulations. We show that such policies, by making attention effectively cheaper, lead firms to reduce trial lengths. The effect on price depends directly on the elasticity of demand from loyal subscribers. We also extend the model to include paid trials, showing that introductory prices and trial lengths act as strategic substitutes. Our framework provides a micro-founded explanation for common features of subscription contracts and offers a new lens through which to evaluate consumer protection policies in digital markets.</description>

      <title>The Post Science Paradigm of Scientific Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: Modelling the Collapse of Ideation Costs, Epistemic Inversion, and the End of Knowledge Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical and formal response to the collapse in the marginal cost of ideation caused by artificial intelligence (AI). In challenging the foundational assumption of knowledge scarcity, the paper argues that the key economic constraint is no longer the generation of ideas, but the alignment of ideation with the recursive structure of human needs. Building on previous work, we further develop Experiential Matrix Theory (EMT), a framework that models innovation as a recursive optimisation process in which alignment, rather than ideation, becomes the binding constraint. Accordingly, we formalise core mechanisms of EMT and apply it to the dynamics of ideation collapse and institutional realignment under AI. Using a series of defensible economic models, we show that in this post-scarcity paradigm, the creation of economic and social value increasingly accrues to roles that guide, interpret, and socially embed ideation, rather than to those that merely generate new ideas. The paper theorises a transition from a knowledge economy to an alignment economy, and derives policy implications for labor hierarchies, subsidy structures, and institutional design. The university, in this context, must invert its function from knowledge transmission to epistemic alignment. The paper concludes by reframing growth not as a function of knowledge accumulation, but of how well society aligns its expanding cognitive capacity with the frontier of experiential human value. This redefinition of the innovation constraint implies a transformation of growth theory, policy design, and institutional purpose in the AI era.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Electrolyser Operation: Integrating External Heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating external heat into electrolysers can reduce the electrical power demand for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Efficient operation requires detailed models that incorporate heat availability and its effect on startup costs. This paper advances existing operational models by endogenously modelling startup costs and direct heat integration, based on a piecewise linear approximation of the electrochemical equations. We analyse the impact of low- and high-temperature heat integration on the efficiency and profitability of hydrogen production for solid oxide and proton exchange membrane electrolysis technologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Leaders and Laggards: A Typology of Renewable Energy Adoption Trajectories with Evidence from Off-Grid Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of renewable energy adoption is essential for designing strategies that accelerate its spread - an urgent priority for advancing climate goals and improving well-being, especially in off-grid regions facing energy poverty. This study introduces a time-series-based analytical framework that quantifies and classifies adoption behaviors of geographic entities within a region. A novel metric, the Adoption over Time Index (ATI), captures cumulative adoption intensity and identifies shifts in adoption trends, improving the ability to distinguish between fundamental adoption paths. By combining ATI with three key features found to be indicative of adoption dynamics, we define a typology of eight distinct paths, including two newly identified trajectories - the decelerating path and the declining moderate path. Applying this framework to a case study of an off-grid Bedouin population in southern Israel reveals that these retreating paths exist in substantial proportions. Identifying such trends is critical for addressing stagnation and preventing backsliding in the diffusion process. The leaping path, by contrast, was nearly absent. We also identify behavioral diversity within both front-runner and trailing groups. Differentiating among these groups can help tailor acceleration strategies. The analysis further reveals significant disparities in adoption levels across the region, with lagging clusters being widespread and overall adoption falling short of the region's potential.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence developer participation and performance. To explore its impact on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, in OSS development where multiple distributed developers voluntarily collaborate. Using GitHub's proprietary Copilot usage data, combined with public OSS repository data obtained from GitHub, we find that Copilot use increases project-level code contributions by 5.9%. This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers. This reveals an important tradeoff: While AI expands who can contribute and how much they contribute, it slows coordination in collective development efforts. Despite this tension, the combined effect of these two competing forces remains positive, indicating a net gain in overall project-level productivity from using AI pair programmers. Interestingly, we also find the effects differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to the difference in their project familiarity. In summary, our study underscores the dual role of AI pair programmers in affecting project-level code contributions and coordination time in OSS development. Our findings on the differential effects between core and peripheral developers also provide important implications for the structure of OSS communities in the long run.</description>

      <title>Autonomy by Design: Preserving Human Autonomy in AI Decision-Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.</description>

      <title>Strategic Alignment Patterns in National AI Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel visual mapping methodology for assessing strategic alignment in national artificial intelligence policies. The proliferation of AI strategies across countries has created an urgent need for analytical frameworks that can evaluate policy coherence between strategic objectives, foresight methods, and implementation instruments. Drawing on data from the OECD AI Policy Observatory, we analyze 15-20 national AI strategies using a combination of matrix-based visualization and network analysis to identify patterns of alignment and misalignment. Our findings reveal distinct alignment archetypes across governance models, with notable variations in how countries integrate foresight methodologies with implementation planning. High-coherence strategies demonstrate strong interconnections between economic competitiveness objectives and robust innovation funding instruments, while common vulnerabilities include misalignment between ethical AI objectives and corresponding regulatory frameworks. The proposed visual mapping approach offers both methodological contributions to policy analysis and practical insights for enhancing strategic coherence in AI governance. This research addresses significant gaps in policy evaluation methodology and provides actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to strengthen alignment in technological governance frameworks.</description>
