      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Three-Particle Elastic Collisions Using Newtonian Mechanics and Vector Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional elastic collisions of three point masses on a line under vacuum, with no triple collisions. We express momentum conservation in matrix form and analyze the composite map $D=D_{BC}D_{AB}$ and its powers $D^k$, which yield the velocities after any prescribed number of collisions for arbitrary mass ratios and initial data.
  After that, using vector $u$ on a plane $s^\perp$, the total number of collisions is \[ n\;=\;1+\Big\lfloor\tfrac{\Omega-\phi_{BC}}{\theta}\Big\rfloor+\Big\lceil\tfrac{\Omega-\phi_{BC}}{\theta}\Big\rceil, \] Through this concept, $D$ is recognised as giving $u$ a rotation with angle $\theta$ which is determined by only mass ratios. And, we calculated energy transfer through collisions. With the work, we find that the change of energy is proportional to total momentum of two particles and average velocity of particles based on initial average velocity of A and B before collision.</description>
