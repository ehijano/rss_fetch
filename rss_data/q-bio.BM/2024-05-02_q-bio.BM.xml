      <title>The Role of Model Architecture and Scale in Predicting Molecular Properties: Insights from Fine-Tuning RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic framework to compare the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for fine-tuning across various cheminformatics tasks. Employing a uniform training methodology, we assessed three well-known models-RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA-on their ability to predict molecular properties using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a universal molecular representation format. Our comparative analysis involved pre-training 18 configurations of these models, with varying parameter sizes and dataset scales, followed by fine-tuning them on six benchmarking tasks from DeepChem. We maintained consistent training environments across models to ensure reliable comparisons. This approach allowed us to assess the influence of model type, size, and training dataset size on model performance. Specifically, we found that LLaMA-based models generally offered the lowest validation loss, suggesting their superior adaptability across tasks and scales. However, we observed that absolute validation loss is not a definitive indicator of model performance - contradicts previous research - at least for fine-tuning tasks: instead, model size plays a crucial role. Through rigorous replication and validation, involving multiple training and fine-tuning cycles, our study not only delineates the strengths and limitations of each model type but also provides a robust methodology for selecting the most suitable LLM for specific cheminformatics applications. This research underscores the importance of considering model architecture and dataset characteristics in deploying AI for molecular property prediction, paving the way for more informed and effective utilization of AI in drug discovery and related fields.</description>

      <title>SynFlowNet: Towards Molecule Design with Guaranteed Synthesis Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modelling have led to a number of works proposing molecular generation models for drug discovery. While these models perform well at capturing drug-like motifs, they are known to often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. This is because they are trained to compose atoms or fragments in a way that approximates the training distribution, but they are not explicitly aware of the synthesis constraints that come with making molecules in the lab. To address this issue, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemically validated reactions and reactants to sequentially build new molecules. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool. SynFlowNet consistently samples synthetically feasible molecules, while still being able to find diverse and high-utility candidates. Furthermore, we compare molecules designed with SynFlowNet to experimentally validated actives, and find that they show comparable properties of interest, such as molecular weight, SA score and predicted protein binding affinity.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and real-world RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive stacked bonds frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in real-world RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in real-world secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>
