      <title>Controlling HER activity and stability of $\gamma$- and 6,6,12-Graphyne through engineered B-N doping: DFT and Reactive MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $\gamma$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $\gamma$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $\pi$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $\gamma$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Mg-Induced Phase Stabilization in Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Mg incorporation on the relative phase stability of the four primary Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with the goal of rationalizing experimental observations suggesting that diffusion from MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates contributes to relative stabilization of the $\gamma$ phase. Mg incorporation is modeled up to 25% of Ga sites within supercells derived from fully relaxed unit cells of each polymorph. Our results show that while $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ remains the thermodynamically most stable phase, the enthalpic differences between polymorphs decrease with increasing Mg content. The inherently disordered $\gamma$ phase, with its high configurational entropy, becomes less energetically unfavorable under Mg substitution, suggesting that entropy-driven stabilization may facilitate its formation under high-temperature and/or nonequilibrium growth conditions such as those previously reported. These findings provide a thermodynamic rationale for the experimental observation of the $\gamma$ phase during epitaxial growth on MgAl$_2$O$_4$ spinel substrates.</description>

      <title>Scalar and fully relativistic pressure and temperature-dependent ab-initio thermodynamics study of simple cubic polonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ab-initio thermodynamic properties of simple cubic polonium ({\alpha}-Po) were studied within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), where both lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitations contributions are included in the Helmholtz free energy. We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) by comparing the scalar relativistic (SR) and fully relativistic (FR) pseudopotentials on the thermodynamic properties of polonium and evaluate the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals, GGA (PBE and PBEsol), and LDA (PZ). Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Gr\"uneisen parameters ({\gamma}_q{\eta}) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Insights into Solute Drag Effects on Grain Boundary Motion in Mg-Al and Mg-Ca Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slip behavior of dislocations and grain boundaries critically governs recrystallization and plastic deformation in Mg alloys and can be strongly influenced by solutes. However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys.</description>

      <title>Segregation-Controlled Diffusion-Induced Grain Boundary Migration in Alloy 690</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration accompanied by Cr depletion is widely observed in Alloy 690 and is closely linked to intergranular degradation and stress corrosion cracking. However, the fundamental driving force for GB migration and its link with Cr depletion remains unclear. In this work, hybrid molecular dynamics and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate GB migration in Alloy 690 under coupled solute diffusion and segregation effects across a range of GB characters. The results show that Cr segregation at GBs, while generally considered favorable for GB stability, can facilitate diffusion-induced GB migration and Cr depletion. Cr diffusion along GBs produces localized Cr depletion zones that are energetically incompatible with positively segregating GBs, generating a chemical driving force that drives GB migration toward the Cr-rich matrix, which ultimately results in persistent GB migration accompanied by a Cr depletion. By quantifying solute-GB interaction energetics, we demonstrate that GB migration is quantitively controlled by the coupled effects of solute diffusivity and segregation strength. These mechanistic insights provide a unified framework that rationalizes experimentally observed correlations between GB character, Cr depletion, and GB migration in Cr-containing alloys.</description>

      <title>Systematic Magnetic Structure Generation Based on Oriented Spin Space Groups: Formulation, Applications, and High-Throughput First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Permanent Lattice Compression of Lead-Halide Perovskite for Persistently Enhanced Optoelectronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under mild mechanical pressure, halide perovskites show enhanced optoelectronic properties. However, these improvements are reversible upon decompression, and permanent enhancements have yet to be realized. Here, we report antisolvent-assisted solvent acidolysis crystallization that enables us to prepare methylammonium lead bromide single crystals showing intense emission at all four edges under ultraviolet light excitation. We study structural variations, edge-vs-center, in these crystals using micro-X-ray diffraction and find that the enhanced emission at the edges correlates with lattice compression compared to in the central areas. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show much longer-lived photogenerated carriers at the compressed edges, with radiative component lifetimes of ca. 1.4 us, 10 times longer than at the central regions. The properties of the edges are exploited to fabricate planar photodetectors exhibiting detectivities of 3x10^13 Jones, compared to 5x10^12 Jones at the central regions. The enhanced lifetimes and detectivities correlate to the reduced trap state densities and the formation of shallower traps at the edges due to lattice compression.</description>

      <title>Materealize: a multi-agent deliberation system for end-to-end material design and synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Materealize, a multi-agent system for end-to-end inorganic materials design and synthesis that orchestrates core domain tools spanning structure generation, property prediction, synthesizability prediction, and synthesis planning within a single unified framework. Through a natural-language interface, Materealize enables non-experts to access computational materials workflows and obtain experimentally actionable outputs for material realization. Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Graphene-based technologies for energy applications, challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on technology developments implemented into the Graphene Flagship European project for the integration of graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) into energy application devices. Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration. The technical challenges still to be addressed are highlighted and perspectives derived from the running works emphasized.</description>

      <title>Bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR): a unique tool to simultaneously investigate thermodynamics, kinetics and electrostatic effects of oxygen reactions in MIEC thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed ionic electronic transfer (MIET) reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at oxide surfaces, are of paramount importance to manifold technologically highly relevant processes and fundamental understanding must be developed to improve performance and tailor highly efficient electrodes and catalysts. Understanding such complex multi-step reactions, requires the study of kinetic processes, underlying thermodynamic properties, i.e. ionic and electronic defect concentrations and electrostatic surface effects. However conventional techniques struggle to uncover the complete picture within the same sample/measurement. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR) as a novel tool to investigate MIET reactions on oxides. It is based on alternating out-of-plane coulometric titration/polarization and in-plane electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, providing simultaneous electronic, ionic and extraordinarily rich surface kinetics information. This innovative combination of electrical and chemical driving forces synergizes information depth, with enhanced time resolution, versatility and speed, yet it lifts the weaknesses of the individual approaches, while remaining cost-effective and surprisingly simple. Furthermore, BCR allows to disentangle overpotential induced electrostatic modifications of the surface kinetics in a unique manner. We showcase the advantages of BCR in this work by studying the ORR in model (La,Sr)FeO$_{3-{\delta}}$ thin film electrodes and reporting on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of pulsed and continuous light and heavy ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of Ag+C60 and Au+C60 composite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal - organic nanocomposite thin films represent a versatile class of materials whose properties can be effectively tuned through external stimuli. In this study, Ag+C60 and Au+C60 nanocomposite thin films were briefly investigated to elucidate the effects of ion irradiation on both their morphology and electrical properties. The films were synthesized by co-deposition of noble metals and fullerenes, using ion beam sputtering of metal targets combined with simultaneous thermal evaporation of C60. The as - deposited films were characterized by ion beam analysis to determine their composition and element depth distributions. Subsequently, the samples were irradiated at room temperature with either a continuous Ar ion beam or a pulsed C ion beam, both at an energy of 20 keV and a fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. While the C-irradiated films retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies, Ar irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces. In addition to morphology, the electrical resistance of the films was measured. The results indicate that C-irradiated samples exhibit only minor changes in resistivity, whereas Ar irradiation strongly affects the electrical properties, with the most significant impact observed for the Au+C60 system. The observed changes in electrical resistance closely correlate with the irradiation-induced surface morphology. The measurement results are briefly discussed below.</description>

      <title>NASICON solid-electrolyte modification and analysis using ion and neutron beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 {\deg}C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI \v{R}e\v{z}). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.</description>

      <title>Hybrid films of Co - C60 preparation and changes induced by external stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the study on organic-metal hybrid systems, in particular Co-C60 fullerene thin films. This study mainly focused on the investigation of the morphological and structural evolution of the film surface after various external stimuli designed to provide energy to the system. For film growth, we adopted an innovative approach, combining ion-beam sputtering of a pure metal target with thermal evaporation of C60 in a co-deposition setup. The films underwent a series of treatments to induce modifications. Laser and ion irradiations were performed using a pulsed laser, a continuous Ar beam, and a pulsed C beam. In addition, thermal annealing in vacuum was performed to examine the long-term effects of temperature. The composition of deposited film was investigated using Ion Beam Analysis, the morphology and the structure, and the effects of treatments on the films were studied using SEM and TEM microscopies and Raman spectroscopy. Changes in electrical resistance were also measured to explore potential applications of these films after treatment.</description>

      <title>Structural stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of the single-layer trilayer La3Ni2O7 polymorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polymorph of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 that displays an alternating single-layer (SL) and trilayer (TL; 1313) stacking pattern has recently been discovered. Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Strain as a topological selector in altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism combines fully compensated magnetic order with a magnetic symmetry that relates inequivalent spin sublattices, offering a promising, still underexplored platform for unconventional topological phases. Here we show that both isotropic tensile strain and electron localization, controlled by an effective Hubbard interaction $U_{\text{eff}}$, can act as efficient and systematic topological control parameters in the altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb. While CrSb hosts Weyl fermions at equilibrium, modest tensile strain of 4-5% stabilizes additional symmetry allowed Dirac crossings and triple-point fermions, with further strain selectively favoring the triple-point phase. We propose a 3D low-energy Hamiltonian that captures the interplay between the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the sublattice symmetry of the altermagnet, giving rise to an interaction-driven Dirac crossing. Our results establish CrSb as a model altermagnet in which either strain or electron localization can selectively access and control the distinct topologies inherent to the altermagnets.</description>

      <title>CVD grown bilayer MoS2 based artificial optoelectronic synapses for arithmetic computing and image recognition applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand for lower computing power has rapidly increased. In this context, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing, which integrate data storage and processing, has attracted significant attention. Here, our study reveals that field effect transistors fabricated on chemical vapor deposited bilayer (2L) MoS2 films can mimic the functions of biological synapse. These devices demonstrate high level of pair pulse facilitation (PPF), short term to long term memory (STM-to-LTM) transition as well as learning-forgetting-relearning properties. Effect of light intensity, pulse number, pulse width and photon energy on the STM-to-LTM transition is studied. It has been found that the rate of depression of the memory state can be controlled using the gate bias. Electrical and optical energy consumptions per synaptic event are estimated to be as low as 280 fJ and 20 nJ, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent in these devices is observed to increase linearly with the number of the excitation pulses. This property has been exploited to demonstrate different arithmetic operations by the device. Moreover, these devices show great potential for image recognition. Artificial neural network simulation has returned an image recognition accuracy of ~85%. All these findings show a great prospect of 2L-MoS2 for developing low power, transparent and flexible neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Modern Theory of Polarization, which rigorously defines the spontaneous electric polarization of a periodic solid and provides a recipe for its computation in electronic structure codes, transformed our understanding of ferroelectricity and related dielectric properties. Here we call for the development of an analogous Modern Theory of Chiralization. We review earlier attempts to quantify chirality, highlight the fundamental and practical developments that a modern theory would facilitate, and suggest possible promising routes to its establishment.</description>

      <title>Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/{\AA}, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.</description>

      <title>Facile Optimization of Combinatorial Sputtering Processes with Arbitrary Numbers of Components for Targeted Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.</description>

      <title>Physical and Dielectric Properties of Polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.</description>

      <title>Biexcitons in Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides Probed by Nonlinear Coherent Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Divergent Pressure Response of Superconductivity in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ ($M$ = Fe, Ru and Ir)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and understanding non-BCS superconductivity remains a central challenge in condensed-matter physics. Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation (${\mu}$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of light and materials technology is key to the creation of innovative sensing technologies. Sensing of electric and magnetic fields, and temperature with high spatio-temporal resolution is a critical task for the development of the next-generation of nanometer-scale quantum devices. Color centers in diamonds are attractive for potential applications owing to their characteristic quantum states, although they require metallic contacts for the introduction of external microwaves. Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions. Our nanoscopic technique will provide new horizons to the sensing of advanced nano materials.</description>

Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atom level can offer valuable insights into material science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor</title>

Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Semimetal Transport Modulated by Interstitial Fe in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+\delta}As$_2$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are renowned for exhibiting large, unsaturated magnetoresistance arising from ultrahigh carrier mobility and electron-hole compensation. However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+\delta}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.</description>

      <title>Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description>

      <title>AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23852v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 10, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Resolving Overlapping EBSD Patterns by Experiment -- Simulation Residuals Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.</description>

Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>

Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>
