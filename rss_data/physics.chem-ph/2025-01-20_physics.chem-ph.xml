      <title>Graphs that predict exciton delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of molecular excitons and related supramolecular systems has largely focused on aggregates where nearest-neighbour couplings dominate. We propose that radically different states can be produced by moving beyond that paradigm. In practice, how to accomplish this task remains an open challenge because it requires development of ways to couple networks molecules more densely. In the present work we motivate why it would be worthwhile. We describe a merger of work developed in the field of discrete mathematics with concepts and needs for the field of molecular excitons. We discuss the reasons for exciton localization and posit how systems where the spectrum contains a gap can be robust to disorder, and thus maintain coherence, or delocalization. We propose that certain kinds of structures (expander graphs) specifying how molecules are coupled to each other, show such a gap and thus resilience to decoherence. We review relevant background known from graph theory. This perspective suggests a fascinating scope of new properties possible by demonstrating expander graph inspired excitonics.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Physical Property Prediction for Organics via Molecular Representation Learning: Bridging Data to Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing energy crisis has underscored the urgent need for energy-efficient materials with high energy utilization efficiency, prompting a surge in research into organic compounds due to their environmental compatibility, cost-effective processing, and versatile modifiability. To address the high experimental costs and time-consuming nature of traditional trial-and-error methods in the discovery of highly functional organic compounds, we apply the 3D transformer-based molecular representation learning algorithm to construct a pre-trained model using 60 million semi-empirically optimized structures of small organic molecules, namely, Org-Mol, which is then fine-tuned with public experimental data to obtain prediction models for various physical properties. Despite the pre-training process relying solely on single molecular coordinates, the fine-tuned models achieves high accuracy (with $R^2$ values for the test set exceeding 0.95). These fine-tuned models are applied in a high-throughput screening process to identify novel immersion coolants among millions of automatically constructed ester molecules, resulting in the experimental validation of two promising candidates. This work not only demonstrates the potential of Org-Mol in predicting bulk properties for organic compounds but also paves the way for the rational and efficient development of ideal candidates for energy-saving materials.</description>

      <title>A theoretical model for linear and nonlinear spectroscopy of plexcitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model to investigate the dynamics and spectroscopic properties of a plexciton system consisting of a molecular exciton coupled to a single short-lived plasmonic mode. The exciton is described as a two-level system (TLS), while the plasmonic mode is treated as a dissipative harmonic oscillator. The hierarchical equations of motion method is employed to simulate energy transfer dynamics, absorption spectra, and two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) of the system across a range of coupling strengths. It is shown that increasing the exciton-plasmon coupling strength drives a transition in the absorption spectra from an asymmetric Fano line shape to a Rabi splitting pattern, while coupling the TLS to intramolecular vibrational modes reduces the central dip of the absorption spectra and makes the line shape more symmetric. The simulated 2DES exhibit distinct features compared to those of a coupled molecular dimer, highlighting the unique nonlinear response of plexciton systems. In addition, a "breathing mod" pattern observed in the strong coupling regime can serve as a direct evidence of Rabi oscillation.</description>

      <title>Phase and sulfur vacancy engineering in cadmium sulfide for boosting hydrogen production from catalytic plastic waste photoconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a well-known low-bandgap photocatalyst, but its efficiency is often hindered by rapid photo-generated carrier recombination and a limited number of active catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an efficient CdS photocatalyst through a novel strategy combining metastable-to-stable phase transformation and sulfur vacancy generation. This strategy integrates hydrothermal treatment and a high-pressure process to create sulfur vacancies, which serve as active catalytic sites, within a thermodynamically stable wurtzite (hexagonal) phase known for its superior photocatalytic properties. The resulting CdS photocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in photoreforming for hydrogen production and the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into valuable materials. Compared to commercial CdS catalysts, this new material shows a 23-fold increase in both hydrogen production and plastic degradation without the need for co-catalysts. Quenching experiments reveal that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the photoreforming process of this vacancy-rich CdS. First-principles calculations via density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the hexagonal phase possesses a lower bandgap and it exhibits further bandgap narrowing with the introduction of sulfur vacancies. These findings not only present an innovative approach to CdS processing but also highlight the critical role of sulfur vacancies as effective defects for the catalytic photoreforming of microplastics.</description>

      <title>A toy model solved by statistical mechanics for teaching reaction kinetics beyond ideality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical equilibrium is fully characterized by thermodynamics, while the rates of chemical reactions can be calculated for ideal solutions by using mass-action equations. The evaluation of the rates of reactions in a non-ideal system is instead much more complex, even at equilibrium, being dependent on the microscopic features of the interactions: no universal theory exist. Here we propose a toy model to help students understand such complexity. It is formulated by means of statistical mechanics and aims at the evaluation of the exchange reaction rate at equilibrium. The toy model can be solved by the students, with various types of interactions, as an exercise. The results prove that no general rule connects the reaction rates to the thermodynamic quantities, such as the activity coefficients, dramatically proving the complexity and richness of the field.</description>

Abstract: A model for the bonding of hypervalent molecules containing sulfur is presented using generalized valence bond wavefunctions. To delineate the model from more commonly used DFT and delocalized wavefunctions, we present detailed comparisons to these other methods. The result is a new concept of local transferable bonding in hypervalent molecules.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Harnessing Heat and Light with Hydrovoltaic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conversion of ambient heat into electricity through natural evaporation presents a promising avenue for sustainable energy technologies. This study introduces a unified framework for evaporation-driven hydrovoltaic (EDHV) devices that transcends traditional mechanisms focused solely on ion streaming at the solid-liquid interface. Our approach harnesses both thermodiffusion and photovoltaic effects to effectively transform waste heat and solar energy into electrical power. Utilizing a top-evaporating surface paired with a bottom silicon-dielectric (core-shell) nanopillar array separated by a liquid layer, we demonstrate significant enhancements in power output under external heating and solar illumination. Our findings reveal that in addition to the movement of a polar solvent (like water and ethanol) and ions in a narrow, partially wetted top electrode region, thermally and light-assisted ion migration from the bottom to the top electrode plays a pivotal role in electricity generation. We developed an equivalent electrical circuit model that quantifies the latter contribution through the capacitive element denoted as transfer capacitance. We demonstrate a state-of-the-art open circuit voltage of 1V and output power density of 0.25W/m2 at 0.1M concentration. Furthermore, we highlight the critical influence of material selection on device performance; transitioning from TiO2 to Al2O3 dielectric shell results in voltage (power) enhancements of 1.9 (3.6 times) at 25{\deg}C and 1.6 (2.4 times) at 70{\deg}C. Notably, high silicon doping yields a 28% increase in open-circuit voltage and a 1.6-fold improvement in power output compared to low-doped samples. These results provide insights into advancing EDHV devices and suggest broader operational strategies that consider environmental conditions, water salinity, and material engineering to optimize the utilization of waste heat and sunlight.</description>

      <title>Approaching the quantum limit of energy resolution in animal magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, hbar. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to hbar, the more "quantum" is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>
