      <title>Floquet engineering tunable periodic gauge fields and simulating real topological phases in cold alkaline-earth atom optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to synthesize tunable periodic gauge fields via Floquet engineering cold alkaline-earth atoms in one-dimensional optical lattice. The artificial magnetic flux is designed to emerge during the combined process of Floquet photon assisted tunneling and internal state transitions. By varying initial phases of driving protocol, our proposal presents the ability to smoothly tune the periodic flux. Moreover, we demonstrate that the effective two-leg flux ladder model can simulate one typical real topological insulator, which is described by the first Stiefel Whitney class and protected by the $PT$ symmetry. Benefiting from the long lifetime of excited states of alkaline-earth atoms, our work opens new possibilities for exploiting the physics related to gauge fields, such as topological phases, in the current cold atom platform.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supersymmetry: Interchangeability Between Jaynes-Cummings and Anti-Jaynes-Cummings Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersymmetric connection that exists between the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes Cummings (AJC) models in quantum optics is unraveled entirely. A new method is proposed to obtain the temporal evolution of observables in the AJC model using supersymmetric techniques, providing an overview of its dynamics and extending the calculation to full photon counting statistics. The approach is general and can be applied to determine the high-order cumulants given an initial state. The analysis reveals that engineering the collapse-revival behavior and the quantum properties of the interacting field is possible by controlling the initial state of the atomic subsystem and the corresponding atomic frequency in the AJC model. The substantial potential for applications of supersymmetric techniques in the context of photonic quantum technologies is thus demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Deciding factor for detecting a particle within a subspace via dark and bright states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1603.05619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of two ultra-cold bosons confined in a one-dimensional double-well potential is studied. We compare the exact dynamics governed by a full two-body Hamiltonian with the dynamics obtained in a two-mode model approximation. We show that for sufficiently large interactions the two-mode model breaks down and higher single-particle states have to be taken into account to describe the dynamical properties of the system correctly.</description>

      <title>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>Exact first-order effect of interactions on the ground-state energy of harmonically-confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ spinless fermions, interacting with each other via a power-law interaction $\epsilon/r^n$, and trapped in an external harmonic potential $V(r) = r^2/2$, in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. For any $0 &lt; n &lt; d+2$, we obtain the ground-state energy $E_N$ of the system perturbatively in $\epsilon$, $E_{N}=E_{N}^{\left(0\right)}+\epsilon E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}+O\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$. We calculate $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ exactly, assuming that $N$ is such that the "outer shell" is filled. For the case of $n=1$ (corresponding to a Coulomb interaction for $d=3$), we extract the $N \gg 1$ behavior of $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$, focusing on the corrections to the exchange term with respect to the leading-order term that is predicted from the local density approximation applied to the Thomas-Fermi approximate density distribution. The leading correction contains a logarithmic divergence, and is of particular importance in the context of density functional theory. We also study the effect of the interactions on the fermions' spatial density. Finally, we find that our result for $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ significantly simplifies in the case where $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Matsubara series expansion for imaginary-time correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for many-body physics.</description>
