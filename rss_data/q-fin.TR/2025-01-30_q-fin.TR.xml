      <title>Forecasting S&amp;P 500 Using LSTM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17366</link>

Abstract: With the volatile and complex nature of financial data influenced by external factors, forecasting the stock market is challenging. Traditional models such as ARIMA and GARCH perform well with linear data but struggle with non-linear dependencies. Machine learning and deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, address these challenges by capturing intricate patterns and long-term dependencies. This report compares ARIMA and LSTM models in predicting the S&amp;P 500 index, a major financial benchmark.
  Using historical price data and technical indicators, we evaluated these models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The ARIMA model showed reasonable performance with an MAE of 462.1, RMSE of 614, and 89.8 percent accuracy, effectively capturing short-term trends but limited by its linear assumptions. The LSTM model, leveraging sequential processing capabilities, outperformed ARIMA with an MAE of 369.32, RMSE of 412.84, and 92.46 percent accuracy, capturing both short- and long-term dependencies. Notably, the LSTM model without additional features performed best, achieving an MAE of 175.9, RMSE of 207.34, and 96.41 percent accuracy, showcasing its ability to handle market data efficiently.
  Accurately predicting stock movements is crucial for investment strategies, risk assessments, and market stability. Our findings confirm the potential of deep learning models in handling volatile financial data compared to traditional ones. The results highlight the effectiveness of LSTM and suggest avenues for further improvements. This study provides insights into financial forecasting, offering a comparative analysis of ARIMA and LSTM while outlining their strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Consistent time travel for realistic interactions with historical data: reinforcement learning for market making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning works best when the impact of the agent's actions on its environment can be perfectly simulated or fully appraised from available data. Some systems are however both hard to simulate and very sensitive to small perturbations. An additional difficulty arises when a RL agent is trained offline to be part of a multi-agent system using only anonymous data, which makes it impossible to infer the state of each agent, thus to use data directly. Typical examples are competitive systems without agent-resolved data such as financial markets. We introduce consistent data time travel for offline RL as a remedy for these problems: instead of using historical data in a sequential way, we argue that one needs to perform time travel in historical data, i.e., to adjust the time index so that both the past state and the influence of the RL agent's action on the system coincide with real data. This both alleviates the need to resort to imperfect models and consistently accounts for both the immediate and long-term reactions of the system when using anonymous historical data. We apply this idea to market making in limit order books, a notoriously difficult task for RL; it turns out that the gain of the agent is significantly higher with data time travel than with naive sequential data, which suggests that the difficulty of this task for RL may have been overestimated.</description>
