      <title>The Puppis A supernova remnant: an early jet-driven neutron star kick followed by jittering jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a point-symmetric morphology of three pairs of ears/clumps in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) Puppis A, supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). In the JJEM, the three pairs of jets that shaped the three pairs of ears/clumps in Puppis A are part of a large, about 10 to 30 pairs of jets that exploded Puppis A. Some similarities in morphological features between CCSNR Puppis A and three multipolar planetary nebulae considered to have been shaped by jets solidify the claim for shaping by jets. Puppis A has a prominent dipole structure, where one side is bright with a well-defined boundary, while the other is faint and defused. The neutron star (NS) remnant of Puppis A has a proper velocity, its natal kick velocity, in the opposite direction to the denser part of the dipole structure. We propose a new mechanism in the frame of the JJEM that imparts a natal kick to the NS, the kick-by-early asymmetrical pair (kick-BEAP) mechanism. At the early phase of the explosion process, the NS launches a pair of jets where one jet is much more energetic than the counter jet. The more energetic jet compresses a dense side to the CCSNR, and, by momentum conservation, the NS recoils in the opposite direction. Our study supports the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe and enriches this explosion mechanism by introducing the novel kick-BEAP mechanism.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of the Star Formation Excess Discovered by JWST through Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a larger number of bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ than was expected. The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at $z\gtrsim10$, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at $z\lesssim6$ can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at $z\simeq10$, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots'', could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as high-z GUNDAM to explore the early universe.</description>

      <title>Strongly magnetized accretion with low angular momentum produces a weak jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherical accretion of magnetized plasma with low angular momentum onto a supermassive black hole, utilizing global General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Black hole-driven feedback in the form of magnetic eruptions and jets triggers magnetized turbulence in the surrounding medium. We find that when the Bondi radius exceeds a certain value relative to the black hole's gravitational radius, this turbulence restricts the subsequent inflow of magnetic flux, strongly suppressing the strength of the jet. Consequently, magnetically arrested disks and powerful jets are not a generic outcome of accretion of magnetized plasma, even if there is an abundance of magnetic flux available in the system. However, if there is significant angular momentum in the inflowing gas, the eruption-driven turbulence is suppressed (sheared out), allowing for the presence of a powerful jet. Both the initially rotating and non-rotating flows go through periods of low and high gas angular momentum, showing that the angular momentum content of the inflowing gas is not just a feature of the ambient medium, but is strongly modified by the eruption and jet-driven black hole feedback. In the lower angular momentum states, our results predict that there should be dynamically strong magnetic fields on horizon scales, but no powerful jet; this state may be consistent with Sgr A* in the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarisation signatures in bombarded magnetar atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars that host huge, complex magnetic fields which require supporting currents to flow along the closed field lines. This makes magnetar atmospheres different from those of passively cooling neutron stars because of the heat deposited by backflowing charges impinging on the star surface layers. This particle bombardment is expected to imprint the spectral and, even more, the polarisation properties of the emitted thermal radiation. We present solutions for the radiative transfer problem for bombarded plane-parallel atmospheres in the high magnetic field regime. The temperature profile is assumed a priori, and selected in such a way to reflect the varying rate of energy deposition in the slab (from the impinging currents and/or from the cooling crust). We find that thermal X-ray emission powered entirely by the energy released in the atmosphere by the magnetospheric back-bombardment is linearly polarised and X-mode dominated, but its polarisation degree is significantly reduced (down to $10-50\%$) when compared with that expected from a standard atmosphere heated only from the cooling crust below. By increasing the fraction of heat flowing in from the crust the polarisation degree of the emergent radiation increases, first at higher energies ($\sim 10$ keV) and then in the entire soft X-ray band. We use our models inside a ray-tracing code to derive the expected emission properties as measured by a distant observer and compare our results with recent IXPE observations of magnetar sources.</description>

      <title>A search for persistent radio sources toward repeating fast radio bursts discovered by CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep non-detections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multi-wavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For 8 FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2--4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB\,20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous ($\gtrsim$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models -- although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.</description>

      <title>Structural response of neutron stars to rapid rotation and its impact on the braking index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that are observed to be slowing down, implying a loss of their kinetic energy. There can be several different physical mechanisms involved in their spin-down process. The properties of fast-rotating pulsars depend on the nature of the neutron star matter, which can also affect the spin-down mechanisms. In this work, we examine three different physical phenomena contributing to the spin-down: magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational mass quadrupole radiation due to the ``mountain" formation, gravitational mass current quadrupole radiation or the r-modes, and calculate the expressions for the braking indices due to all of them. We have also considered jointly the implications of the uncertainties of the equation of the state of neutron star matter and rapid rotation on the braking indices corresponding to the aforementioned processes and their combinations. In all cases, the rapid rotation results in a departure from the standard values in the literature for the braking index when the rotational effects are ignored. If generated with a saturation amplitude within the range of $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$, the r-mode oscillations dominate the spin-down of millisecond pulsars. We also explore the braking index in the context of millisecond magnetars. This study examines two braking index measurements in the context of newly born millisecond magnetars from two observed short $\gamma$-ray bursts. The measured braking indices for these objects are consistent with our estimation, which allows us to conclude that the spin frequency of the remnants is within the range of $\sim 550-850$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Long-term Evolutionary Links Between the Isolated Neutron Star Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the evolutionary connections of the isolated neutron star (NS) populations including radio pulsars (RPs), anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), dim isolated NSs (XDINs), ``high-magnetic-field'' RPs (``HBRPs''), central compact objects (CCOs), rotating radio transients (RRATs), and long-period pulsars (LPPs) in the fallback disc model. The model can reproduce these NS families as a natural outcome of different initial conditions (initial period, disc mass, and dipole moment, $\mu$) with a continuous $\mu$ distribution in the $\sim 10^{27} - 5 \times 10^{30}$ G cm$^3$ range. Results of our simulations can be summarised as follows: (1) A fraction of ``HBRPs'' with relatively high $\mu$ evolve into the persistent AXP/SGR properties, and subsequently become LPPs. (2) Persistent AXP/SGRs do not have evolutionary links with CCOs, XDINs, and RRATs. (3) For a wide range of $\mu$, most RRATs evolve passing through RP or ``HBRP'' properties during their early evolutionary phases. (4) A fraction of RRATs which have the highest estimated birth rate seem to be the progenitors of XDINs. (5) LPPs, whose existence was predicted by the fallback disc model, are the sources evolving in the late stage of evolution before the discs become inactive. These results provide concrete support to the ideas proposing evolutionary connections between the NS families to account for the ``birth-rate problem'', the discrepancy between the cumulative birth rate estimated for these systems and the core-collapse supernova rate.</description>

      <title>Accretion Disc Outbursts and Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disc outbursts are re-occurring events observed in various astrophysical systems, including X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables. These outbursts are characterized by a sudden increase in luminosity due to various instabilities in the accretion disc. We need to investigate the time-dependent accretion flow models to understand the mechanisms driving these outbursts. Time-dependent models incorporate the disc's time evolution and can capture the build-up of instabilities. This review aims to give a basic overview of accretion disc outburst and stability analysis. The paper highlights the necessity of considering the hierarchy of different timescales, dynamical, viscous, and thermal, when investigating the instabilities occurring in the accretion disc. The importance and observational implications of studying these accretion disc outbursts are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Short-term variability of the transitional pulsar candidate CXOU J110926.4-650224 from X-rays to infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CXOU J110926.4-650224 is a candidate transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) with X-ray and radio emission properties reminiscent of those observed in confirmed tMSPs in their X-ray 'subluminous' disc state. We present the results of observing campaigns that, for the first time, characterise the optical and near-infrared variability of this source and establish a connection with the mode-switching phenomenon observed in X-rays. The optical emission exhibited flickering activity, frequent dipping episodes where it appeared redder, and a multi-peaked flare where it was bluer. The variability pattern was strongly correlated with that of the X-ray emission. Each dip matched an X-ray low-mode episode, indicating that a significant portion of the optical emission originates from nearly the same region as the X-ray emission. The near-infrared emission also displayed remarkable variability, including a dip of 20 min in length during which it nearly vanished. Time-resolved optical spectroscopic observations reveal significant changes in the properties of emission lines from the disc and help infer the spectral type of the companion star to be between K0 and K5. We compare the properties of CXOU J110926.4-650224 with those of other tMSPs in the X-ray subluminous disc state and discuss our findings within the context of a recently proposed scenario that explains the phenomenology exhibited by the prototypical tMSP PSR J1023+0038.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal study of atoll source GX 9+9 observed with AstroSat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we performed a spectro-temporal investigation of the low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+9 using the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) and Soft X- ray Telescope (SXT) observation on board AstroSat. The source was detected in the soft state during the observation, which results in a disk dominating energy spectrum within the energy range of 0.7-25.0 keV. We carried out the analysis at different flux levels. In the temporal analysis, LAXPC data in all flux levels showed the presence of noise components, describing broad Lorentzian components. We modeled the energy-dependent temporal properties of the source in order to identify the radiative origin of the observed variability. This source is not a well-studied source; hence we attempt to estimate various source characteristics like inner-disk radius, flux, and inner-disk temperature.</description>

Abstract: This brief review is based on a lecture given by one of the authors at the international youth conference AYSS-2023. It is devoted to multimessenger astronomy, which studies astrophysical objects and phenomena using various particles and waves that bring information from space. The messengers include electromagnetic and gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. We discuss new opportunities that open up with the combined use of several carriers of information. Combination of data obtained through various observation channels allows one to obtain more complete and accurate information about the processes occurring in the Universe, and even to use it for studying fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Energy-dependent broadband variability in the black-hole transient GX 339-4 using Astrosat and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectro-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray transient GX 339-4 using simultaneous observations from Astrosat and NICER during the 2021 outburst period. The combined spectrum obtained from NICER, LAXPC, and SXT data is effectively described by a model comprising a thermal disk component, hard Comptonization component, and reflection component with an edge. Our analysis of the Astrosat and NICER spectra indicates the source to be in a low/hard state, with a photon index of ~1.64. The Power Density Spectra (PDS) obtained from both Astrosat and NICER observations exhibit two prominent broad features at 0.22 Hz and 2.94 Hz. We generated energy-dependent time lag and fractional root mean square (frms) at both frequencies in a broad energy range of 0.5-30 keV and found the presence of hard lags along with a decrease in variability at higher energy levels. Additionally, we discovered that the correlated variations in accretion rate, inner disc radius, coronal heating rate, and the scattering fraction, along with a delay between them, can explain the observed frms and lag spectra for both features.</description>

      <title>A Revised Spin of the Black Hole in GRS 1716-249 with a New Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRS 1716-249 is a stellar-mass black hole in a low-mass X-ray binary that underwent a gaint outburst in 2016/17. In this paper we use simultaneous observations of Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR to determine its basic parameters. The observations were performed during the softest part of the outburst, and the spectra show clear thermal disk emission and reflection features. We have fitted the X-ray energy spectra using the joint fitting method of the continuum and reflection components with the kerrbb2+ relxill model. Since there is a possibility that the distance to this source was previously underestimated, we use the latest distance parameter of 6.9 kpc in our study, in contrast to previous work in which the distance was set at 2.4 kpc. Through spectral fitting of fixing black hole mass at 6.4 $M_{\rm \odot}$, we observe a strong dependence of the derived spin on the distance: $a_{*}=0.972_{-0.005}^{+0.004}$ at an assumed distance of 2.4 kpc and $a_{*}=0.464_{-0.007}^{+0.016}$ at an assumed distance of 6.9 kpc, at a confidence level of 90%. If considering the uncertainties in the distance and black hole mass, there will be a wider range of spin with $a_{*}$ &lt; 0.78. The fitting results with the new distance indicate that GRS 1716-249 harbors a moderate spin black hole with an inclined ($i\sim 40-50^{\circ}$) accretion disk around it. Additionally, we have also found that solely using the method of the reflection component fitting but ignoring the constraints on the spin from the accretion disk component will result in an extremely high spin.</description>

      <title>X-ray view of emission lines in optical spectra: Spectral analysis of the two low-mass X-ray binary systems Swift J1357.2-0933 and MAXI J1305-704</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for determining the orbital inclination of low-mass X-ray binary systems by modelling the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles emitted by the accretion disc, with a Newtonian version of diskline. We applied the model to two sample sources, Swift J1357.2-0933 and MAXI J1305-704, which are both transient black hole systems, and analyse two observations that were collected during a quiescent state and one observation of an outburst. The line profile is well described by the diskline model, although we had to add a Gaussian line to describe the deep inner core of the double-peaked profile, which the diskline model was unable to reproduce. The H$\beta$ emission lines in the spectrum of Swift J1357.2-0933 and the H$\alpha$ emission lines in that of MAXI J1305-704 during the quiescent state are consistent with a scenario in which these lines originate from a disc ring between $(9.6-57) \times 10^{3}, \rm{R_{g}}$ and $(1.94-20) \times 10^{4}, \rm{R_{g}}$, respectively. We estimate an inclination angle of $81 \pm 5$ degrees for Swift J1357.2-0933 and an angle of $73 \pm 4$ degrees for MAXI J1305-704. This is entirely consistent with the values reported in the literature. In agreement with the recent literature, our analysis of the outburst spectrum of MAXI J1305-704 revealed that the radius of the emission region deviates from expected values. This outcome implies several potential scenarios, including alternative disc configuration or even a circumbinary disc. We caution that these results were derived from a simplistic model that may not fully describe the complicated physics of accretion discs. Despite these limitations, our results for the inclination angles are remarkably consistent with recent complementary studies, and the proposed description of the emitting region remains entirely plausible.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Accretion is all about Sub-Keplerian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the advantages of fitting with a Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) which uses only four physical parameters. We then present the results of hydrodynamic simulations to highlight the fact that the primary component of a black hole accretion remains the sub-Keplerian or the low angular momentum flow independent of whether we have a high, intermediate or low mass X-ray binary. Every aspect of spectral and timing properties, including the disk-jet connection could be understood well only if such a component is present along with a Keplerian component of variable size and accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of the ULX Holmberg II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario: Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution with a power-law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case, we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies $\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2, respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining the energetic GeV photons.</description>

      <title>Improved Moving-Puncture Techniques for Compact Binary Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01137v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fully unlock the scientific potential of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, numerical relativity (NR) simulation accuracy will need to be greatly enhanced. We present three infrastructure-agnostic improvements to the moving-puncture approach for binary black hole (BBH) simulations, aimed at greatly reducing constraint violation and improving GW predictions. Although these improvements were developed within the highly efficient NR code BlackHoles@Home, we demonstrate their effectiveness in the widely-adopted Einstein Toolkit/Carpet AMR framework. Our improvements include a modified Kreiss-Oliger dissipation prescription, a Hamiltonian-constraint-damping adjustment to the BSSN equations, and an extra term to the 1+log lapse evolution equation that slows the development of the sharp lapse feature, which dominates numerical errors in BBH simulations. With minimal increase in computational cost, these improvements greatly reduce GW noise, enabling the extraction of high-order GW modes previously obscured by numerical noise. They also improve convergence properties near and inside the convergent regime, reduce Hamiltonian (momentum) constraint violations in the strong-field region by roughly two (three) orders of magnitude, and in the GW-extraction zone by five (two) orders of magnitude. To promote community adoption, we have open-sourced the improved Einstein Toolkit thorn BaikalVacuum used in this work. Although our focus is on BBH evolutions and the BSSN formulation, these improvements may also benefit compact binary simulations involving matter and other formulations, a focus for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Linking Transients to their Host Galaxies: II. A Comparison of Host Galaxy Properties and Rate Dependencies across Supernova Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the latest dataset of supernova (SN) host galaxies to investigate how the host properties -- stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, absolute magnitude, and colour -- differ across SN types, with redshift-driven selection effects controlled. SN Ib and Ic host galaxies, on average, are more massive, metal-rich, and redder than SN II hosts. For subtypes, SN Ibn and Ic-BL have bluer hosts than their normal SN Ib and Ic siblings; SN IIb has consistent host properties with SN Ib, while hosts of SN IIn are more metal-rich than those of SN II. Hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernovae feature bluer and lower luminosity hosts than most subtypes of core-collapse supernova (CC SN). Assuming simple proportionality of CC SN rates and host star formation rates (SFRs) does not recover the observed mean host properties; either a population of long-lived progenitors or a metallicity-dependent SN production efficiency better reproduces the observed host properties. Assuming the latter case, the rates of SN II are insensitive to host metallicity, but the rates of SN Ib and Ic are substantially enhanced in metal-rich hosts by a factor of ~10 per dex increase in metallicity. Hosts of SN Ia are diverse in their observed properties; subtypes including SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM prefer star-forming hosts, while subtypes like SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich prefer quiescent hosts. The rates of SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM are closely dependent on, or even proportional to, their host SFRs, indicating relatively short-lived progenitors. Conversely, the rates of SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich transients are proportional to the total stellar mass, favoring long-lived progenitors.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Calibrator Grid at 600MHz for Fast Radio Transient Localizations with CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project has a new VLBI Outrigger at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO), which forms a 3300km baseline with CHIME operating at 400-800MHz. Using 100ms long full-array baseband "snapshots" collected commensally during FRB and pulsar triggers, we perform a shallow, wide-area VLBI survey covering a significant fraction of the Northern sky targeted at the positions of compact sources from the Radio Fundamental Catalog. In addition, our survey contains calibrators detected from two 1s long trial baseband snapshots for a deeper survey with CHIME and GBO. In this paper, we present the largest catalog of compact calibrators suitable for 30-milliarcsecond-scale VLBI observations at sub-GHz frequencies to date. Our catalog consists of 200 total calibrators in the Northern Hemisphere that are compact on 30-milliarcsecond scales with fluxes above 100mJy. This calibrator grid will enable the precise localization of hundreds of FRBs a year with CHIME/FRB-Outriggers.</description>

      <title>Instability and warping in vertically oscillating accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many accretion discs have been found to be distorted: either warped due a misalignment in the system, or non-circular as a result of orbital eccentricity or tidal deformation by a binary companion. Warped, eccentric, and tidally distorted discs are not in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus exhibit vertical oscillations in the direction perpendicular to the disc, a phenomenon that is absent in circular and flat discs. In extreme cases, this vertical motion is manifested as a vertical `bouncing' of the gas, potentially leading to shocks and heating, as observed in recent global numerical simulations. In this paper we isolate the mechanics of vertical disc oscillations by means of quasi-2D and fully 3D hydrodynamic local (shearing-box) models. To determine the numerical and physical dissipation mechanisms at work during an oscillation we start by investigating unforced oscillations, examining the effect of initial oscillation amplitude, as well as resolution, boundary conditions, and vertical box size on the dissipation and energetics of the oscillations. We then drive the oscillations by introducing a time-dependent gravitational potential. A key result is that even a purely vertically oscillating disc is (parametrically) unstable to developing inertial waves, as we confirm through a linear stability analysis. The most important of these has the character of a bending wave, whose radial wavelength depends on the frequency of the vertical oscillation. The nonlinear phase of the instability exhibits shocks, which dampen the oscillations, although energy can also flow from the bending wave back to the vertical oscillation.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Mass and Photometric Components of NGC 4826</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present IR photometry and HST imaging and spectroscopy of Sab galaxy NGC 4826. Schwarzschild dynamical modeling is used to measure its central black hole mass $M$. Photometric decomposition is used to enable a comparison of $M$ to published scaling relations between black hole masses and properties of host bulges. This decomposition implies that NGC 4826 contains classical and pseudo bulges of approximately equal mass. The classical bulge has best-fit S\'ersic index $n=3.27$. The pseudobulge is made up of three parts, an inner lens ($n=0.18$ at $r\lesssim4^{\prime\prime}$), an outer lens ($n=0.17$ at $r \lesssim 45^{\prime\prime}$), and a $n=0.58$ component required to match the surface brightness between the lens components. The total $V$-band luminosity of the galaxy is $M_{VT}=-21.07$, the ratio of classical bulge to total light is $B/T\simeq0.12$, and the ratio of pseudobulge to total light is $PB/T\simeq0.13$. The outer disk is exponential ($n=1.07$) and makes up $D/T=0.75$ of the light of the galaxy. Our best-fit Schwarzschild model has a black hole mass with $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $M=8.4^{+1.7}_{-0.6}\times10^6\ M_\odot$ and a stellar $K$-band mass-to-light ratio of $\Upsilon_K=0.46\pm0.03\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{L}_{\odot}^{-1}$ at the assumed distance of 7.27 Mpc. Our modeling is marginally consistent with $M=0$ at the $3\sigma$ limit. These best-fit parameters were calculated assuming the black hole is located where the velocity dispersion is largest; this is offset from the maximum surface brightness, probably because of dust absorption. The black hole mass -- one of the smallest measured by modeling stellar dynamics -- satisfies the well known correlations of $M$ with the $K$-band luminosity, stellar mass, and velocity dispersion of the classical bulge only in contrast to total (classical plus pseudo) bulge luminosity.</description>

      <title>Likelihood reconstruction of radio signals of neutrinos and cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays are excellent probes of astroparticle physics phenomena. For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters like arrival direction and energy is essential. Current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and so far has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in a radio detector with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate with a toy-model reconstruction that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. Additionally, by correctly accounting for correlations, the likelihood description constrains the best-fit parameters better than alternative methods and thus improves experimental reconstruction capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Faraday rotation measure of the M87 jet at 3.5mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faraday rotation is an important probe of the magnetic fields and magnetized plasma around active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. We present a Faraday rotation measure image of the M87 jet between 85.2 GHz and 101.3 GHz with a resolution of ~2" with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We found that the rotation measure (RM) of the M87 core is $\rm (4.5\pm 0.4)\times10^{4}\ rad\ m^{-2}$ with a low linear polarization fraction of $\rm (0.88\pm 0.08)\%$. The spatial RM gradient in the M87 jet spans a wide range from $\sim -2\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ to $\sim 3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ with a typical uncertainty of $0.3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$. A comparison with previous RM measurements of the core suggests that the Faraday rotation of the core may originate very close to the super massive black hole (SMBH). Both an internal origin and an external screen with a rapidly varying emitting source could be possible. As for the jet, the RM gradient indicates a helical configuration of the magnetic field that persists up to kpc scale. Combined with the kpc-scale RM measurements at lower frequencies, we found that RM is frequency-dependent in the jet. One possible scenario to explain this dependence is that the kpc-scale jet has a trumpet-like shape and the jet coil unwinds near its end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the paradigm examples to probe into pulsar magnetospheric dynamics, PSR B0943+10 (J0946+0951) manifests representatively, showing mode switch, orthogonal polarization and subpulse drifting, frequently studied below 600 MHz. Here both integrated and single pulses are studied at a high frequency (1.25 GHz) with FAST. The mode switch is studied using a profile decomposition method. A phase space evolution for the pulsar's mode switch shows a strange-attractor-like pattern. The radiative geometry is proposed by fitting polarization position angles with the rotating vector model. The pulsar pulse profile is then mapped to the sparking locations on pulsar surface, and the differences between the main pulse's and the precursor component's radiative processes may explain the X-ray's synchronization with radio mode switch. Detailed single pulse studies on B0943+10's orthogonally polarized radiation are presented, which may support for certain models of radiative transfer of polarized emission. Especially, the difference in OPMs' circular polarization might reflect the cyclotron absorption in pulsar magnetospheres. B0943+10's B and Q modes evolve differently with frequency and have different proportions of orthogonal modes, which indicates possible magnetospheric changes during mode switch. For Q mode pulse profile, the precursor and the main pulse components are orthogonally polarized, and are probably originated from different depths in the magnetosphere. The findings could impact significantly on pulsar electrodynamics and the radiative mechanism related.</description>

      <title>Searching for Magnetar Binaries Disrupted by Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\sim45\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\lesssim f_u \lesssim 24\%$, which disagrees with neutron star population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\lesssim f_{nc} \lesssim 66\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\lesssim f_m \lesssim 86\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.</description>

      <title>Explanation for the absence of secondary peaks in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current perspective about the explosions of massive hydrogen-rich blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (&gt; ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.</description>

      <title>Simulating short GRB jets in late binary neutron star merger environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic emission and the afterglow observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817A confirmed the association of the merger with a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) harboring a narrow ($5${\deg}-$10${\deg}) and powerful ($10^{49}$-$10^{50}~$erg) jet. Using the 1~second-long neutrino-radiation-GR-MHD simulation of coalescing neutron stars of Kiuchi et al. (2023) and following the semi-analytical estimates of Pais et al. (2023), we inject a narrow, powerful, unmagnetized jet into the post-merger phase. We explore different opening angles, luminosities, central engine durations, and times after the merger. We explore early ($0.1~$s following the merger) and late ($1~$s) jet launches; the latter is consistent with the time delay of $\approx 1.74~$s observed between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. We demonstrate that the semi-analytical estimates correctly predict the jets' breakout and collimation conditions. When comparing our synthetic afterglow light curves to the observed radio data of GW170807, we find a good agreement for a $3 \times 10^{49}$ ergs jet launched late with an opening angle in the range $\simeq 5${\deg}-$7${\deg}.</description>

      <title>Effects from Dark Matter Halos on X-ray Pulsar Pulse Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) can capture dark matter (DM) particles because of their deep gravitational potential and high density. The accumulated DM can affect the properties of NSs. In this work we use a general relativistic two-fluid formalism to solve the structure of DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) and the surrounding spacetime. Specifically, we pay attention to the situation where those DANSs possess DM halos. Due to the gravitational effect of the DM halo, the pulse profile of an X-ray pulsar is changed. Our study finds a universal relation between the peak flux deviation of the pulse profile and $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}$, which is the ratio of the DM halo mass, $M_{\rm halo}$, to the baryonic matter (BM) core radius, $R_{\rm BM}$. Our results show that, when $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}=0.292$ and the DM particle mass $m_f = 0.3\,$GeV, the maximum deviation of the profile can be larger than 100$\%$, which has implication in X-ray pulsar observation.</description>

      <title>Viewing explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>X-ray Redshifts for Obscured Active Galactic Nuclei with AXIS Deep and Intermediate Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the capabilities of the AXIS telescope in estimating redshifts from X-ray spectra alone (X-ray redshifts, XZs). Through extensive simulations, we establish that AXIS observations enable reliable XZ estimates for more than 5500 obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) up to redshift $z\sim 6$ in the proposed deep (7 Ms) and intermediate (375 ks) surveys. Notably, at least 1600 of them are expected to be in the Compton-Thick regime ($\log N_H/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}\geq 24$), underscoring the pivotal role of AXIS in sample these elusive objects that continue to be poorly understood. XZs provide an efficient alternative for optical/infrared faint sources, overcoming the need for time-consuming spectroscopy, potential limitations of photometric redshifts, and potential issues related to multi-band counterpart association. This approach will significantly enhance the accuracy of constraints on the X-ray luminosity function and obscured AGN fractions up to high redshift. This White Paper is part of a series commissioned for the AXIS Probe Concept Mission; additional AXIS White Papers can be found at the AXIS website (http://axis.astro.umd.edu) with a mission overview here: arXiv:2311.00780.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The duration of the neutrino burst from the supernova event SN 1987A is known to be sensitive to exotic sources of cooling, such as axions radiated from the dense and hot hadronic matter thought to constitute the inner core of the supernova. We perform the first quantitative study of the role of hadronic matter beyond the first generation -- in particular strange matter. We do so by consistently including the full baryon and meson octets, and computing axion emissivity induced from baryon-meson to baryon-axion scatterings as well as from baryon decays. We consider a range of supernova thermodynamic conditions, as well as equation-of-state models with different strangeness content. We obtain the first bound on the axial axion-strange-strange coupling, as well as the strongest existing bound on the axion-down-strange counterpart. Our bound on the latter coupling can be as small as $O(10^{-2})$ for $f_a = 10^9$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) particles of mass $m_\phi \lesssim 1~{\rm eV}$ can form boson stars in DM halos. Collapse of boson stars leads to explosive bosenova emission of copious relativistic ULDM particles. In this work, we analyze sensitivity of terrestrial and space-based experiments to detect such relativistic scalar ULDM particles interacting through quadratic couplings with Standard Model constituents, including electrons, photons and gluons. We highlight key differences with searches for linear ULDM couplings. Screening of ULDM with quadratic couplings near the surface of the Earth can significantly impact observations in terrestrial experiments, motivating future space-based experiments. We demonstrate excellent ULDM discovery prospects, especially for quantum sensors, which can probe quadratic couplings orders below existing constraints by detecting bosenova events in the ULDM mass range $10^{-23}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-5}\,{\rm eV}$. We also report updated constraints on quadratic couplings of ULDM in case it comprises cold DM.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04946</link>

Abstract: X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of simplifications in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $ 10^{35}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 5$ keV increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays down to $z \approx 0.1R$. The contribution of flare X-rays to the ionization at the midplane depends on the disk parameters such as disk mass and dust settling. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Charting the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Sky with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.</description>
