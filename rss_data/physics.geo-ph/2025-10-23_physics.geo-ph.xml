      <title>Towards Three Component Seismograms From One Component DAS Records; Finite Frames in Geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some geophysical observations commonly collect only one component (1C) of a three component (3C) vector field. For example, Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) records seismograms derived from displacement differences along the axis of segments of a fiber optic cable. In practice, multiple observations from such 3C vector fields are available, but commonly along non-orthogonal directions -- i.e.\ desirable sets of observations along orthogonal basis vectors are not available. For DAS, the theory of (finite) frames allows the recovery of 3C vector observations as long as the set of measurements occur on axis-vectors that mathematically span 3D space. A reconstruction algorithm from finite frame theory is described and then applied to geometry data from a borehole at the Utah FORGE geothermal project. The results demonstrate recovery of high precision 3C vectors along the fiber optic cable from 1C input vector-projections.</description>

      <title>PCP-GAN: Property-Constrained Pore-scale image reconstruction via conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations. This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197. Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to 36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for implementing digital rock physics.</description>

      <title>Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed waveform inversion using pretrained wavefield neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation, resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches. Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for real-time subsurface monitoring.</description>
