      <title>Non-Hermitian edge burst of sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored. Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases, continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes. Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.</description>

      <title>A non-invasive dry-transfer method for fabricating mesoscopic devices on sensitive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials with novel or exotic properties are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as air, solvents, and heat, which complicates device fabrication and limits their potential applications. Here, we present a universal submicron fabrication method for mesoscopic devices using a dry-transfer technique, tailored specifically for sensitive materials. This approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is carried out in a glove box, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents, and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K2Cr3As3 and WTe2 devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Optical Switching of Moir\'e Chern Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision and fast control. Fractional Chern ferromagnet states in moir\'e superlattices are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 bilayers using circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moir\'e Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Accumulations Drive Magnetization Reversal in Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.</description>

      <title>Regularized Micromagnetic Theory for Bloch Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic singularities known as Bloch points (BPs) present a fundamental challenge for micromagnetic theory, which is based on the assumption of a fixed magnetization vector length. Due to the divergence of the effective field at a BP, classical micromagnetics fails to adequately describe BP dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a regularized micromagnetic model in which the magnetization vector can vary in length but not exceed a threshold value. More specifically, the magnetization is treated as an order parameter constrained to a S3-sphere. This constraint respects fundamental properties of local spin expectation values in quantum systems. We derive the corresponding regularized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analogue of the Thiele equation describing the steady motion of spin textures under various external stimuli. We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by modeling the dynamics of several magnetic textures containing BPs, including domain walls in nanowires, chiral bobbers, and magnetic dipolar strings. The presented results extend micromagnetic theory by incorporating a regularized description of BP dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>Tunable multi-magnon Floquet topological edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a micro/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.</description>

Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

Abstract: We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects, charge-to-spin conversion, and spin pumping from chiral-spin modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the spin polarization induced by an electric field or current, and the inverse-Edelstein effect (also known as the spin-galvanic effect), which is the electric current induced by an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of chiral-spin collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the resonances in Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and in a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We study the spectral weight distribution between the two modes over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that using the chiral-spin modes one can get a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion and gain a directional control of the injected spins in the spin-pumping process, both of which are relevant to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Influence of excitation energy on microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings reveal that the microscopic pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures are highly sensitive to the excitation energy, an aspect that should be carefully considered when optimizing the performance of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically explore Floquet engineering in few-layer black phosphorus (fBP) under time-periodic driving. Motivated by the ability of circularly polarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we investigate the emergence of a photoinduced dc Hall effect in the Dirac semimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry curvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform lattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to compute Floquet band structures and dc Hall conductivity under a perpendicular electric field. Our results reveal that the dc Hall current in fBP can be effectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.</description>

Abstract: We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.</description>

Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian parameters of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in quantum matter. Here we establish a machine learning strategy to extract the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable us to learn a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.</description>

Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for solving ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we propose a novel technique called non-diagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Qubit Calibration by Binary-Search Hamiltonian Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and experimentally implement a real-time protocol for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit, achieving exponential scaling in calibration precision with the number of measurements, up to the limit imposed by decoherence. The real-time processing capabilities of a classical controller dynamically generate adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing evolution time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. The scheme does not require repeated measurements at the same setting, as it accounts for state preparation and measurement errors. Its use of a parametrized probability distribution favors numerical accuracy and computational speed. We show the efficacy of the algorithm by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. As benchmarked by gate-set tomography, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) powered control electronics partially mitigates non-Markovian noise, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. The mitigation is achieved by dynamically updating and feeding forward the qubit frequency. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances</title>

Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic tensor and hydrodynamics of altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>

      <title>Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>
