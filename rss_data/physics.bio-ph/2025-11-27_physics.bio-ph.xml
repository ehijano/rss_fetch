      <title>Rectification of stress by fiber networks: Manifestation of non-linear screening through self-organized buckling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force transmission at large length scales is crucial for such biological functions as cell motility and morphogenesis. The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to "mechanical screening" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.</description>

      <title>A software-based focus system for wide-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term time-lapse imaging of biological samples requires correcting for focal drift, which would otherwise gradually push the sample out of focus. We present a software-based method that eliminates this time-dependent blur using only a motorized Z-drive, with no additional hardware. The method relies on imaging marks made on the side of the coverslip opposite to the sample. We provide a Beanshell script implementation, evaluate its performance across multiple objectives, and benchmark it against a hardware autofocus system, finding comparable results. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in live imaging of growing bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Phase Plane Analysis of Firing Patterns in the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) model is a simplified framework that effectively characterizes neuronal electrical activity. The aim of this paper is to employ phase plane analysis to systematically investigate diverse firing patterns generated by the AdEx model under varying parametric conditions. We first introduce the fundamental equations and parameter configurations of the AdEx model to numerically simulate the six representative firing patterns in the AdEx model. And then we use phase plane analysis to explore the dynamic mechanism of these firing patterns under different input currents and parametric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns. These results not only advance the understanding of complex electrophysiological phenomena in neurons but also provide theoretical foundations for applications in many fields like neuromorphic computing and brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Charge +1 Topological Defects in Polar Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are a conspicuous feature of active liquid crystals that have been associated with important morphogenetic transitions in organismal development. Robust development thus requires a tight control of the motion and placement of topological defects. In this manuscript, we study a mechanism to control +1 topological defects in an active polar fluid confined to a disk. If activity is localized in an annulus within the disk, the defect moves on a circular trajectory around the center of the disk. Using an ansatz for the polar field, we determine the dependence of the angular speed and the circle radius on the boundary orientation of the polar field and the active annulus. Using a proportional integral controller, we guide the defect along complex trajectories by changing the active annulus size and the boundary orientation.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These \textit{recognition} sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the emerging field of coarse-grained cellular growth modeling, and aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical application. By adopting an original "cookbook" approach, it is designed to offer a hands-on guide for constructing and analyzing different key aspects of cellular growth, focusing on available results for bacteria and beyond. The tutorial is structured as a series of step-by-step "recipes", and covers essential concepts, recent literature, and key challenges. It aims to empower a broad audience, from students to seasoned researchers, to replicate, extend, and innovate in this scientific area. Specifically, each section provides detailed, bare-bone models to start working in each area, from basic steady-state growth to variable environments and focusing on different key layers relevant to biosynthesis, transcription, translation, nutrient sensing and protein degradation, links between cell cycle and growth, ending with ecological insights.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Chirality, confinement and dimensionality govern re-entrant transitions in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of individual chiral active particles underpin the complex behavior of chiral active matter. Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.</description>

      <title>Investigating time- and orientation-dependent transverse relaxation from magnetic susceptibility of white matter microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive how transverse relaxation depends on the angle between axons and the external magnetic field. Simulations show that the time-dependent power-law signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be difficult to detect at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. This is because the power-law curvature over a typical range of echo times deviates only slightly from a linear trend. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>
