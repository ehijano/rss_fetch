      <title>Profunctorial algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a bicategorical generalization of Barr's landmark 1970 paper, in which he describes how to extend Set-monads to relations and uses this to characterize topological spaces as the relational algebras of the ultrafilter monad. With two-sided discrete fibrations playing the role of relations in a bicategory, we first characterize, in terms of exact squares, when pseudomonads on a bicategory extend to its bicategory of two-sided discrete fibrations. As a wide class of examples, we show that every Set-monad induces a pseudomonad on the 2-category of categories satisfying our criterion and thus extending to profunctors. Among these, we then focus on the ultracompletion pseudomonad, whose pseudoalgebras are ultracategories: we characterize the normalized lax algebras of its profunctorial extension as ultraconvergence spaces, a recently-introduced categorification of topological spaces.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is a foundational Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to formulate and analyse MH in terms of categorical probability, using a recent involutive framework for MH-type procedures as a concrete case study. We show how basic MCMC concepts such as invariance and reversibility can be formulated in Markov categories, and how one part of the MH kernel can be analysed using standard CD categories. To go further, we then study enrichments of CD categories over commutative monoids. This gives an expressive setting for reasoning abstractly about a range of important probabilistic concepts, including substochastic kernels, finite and $\sigma$-finite measures, absolute continuity, singular measures, and Lebesgue decompositions. Using these tools, we give synthetic necessary and sufficient conditions for a general MH-type sampler to be reversible with respect to a given target distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial difference operators for a large class of functors between presheaf categories are introduced, extending our difference operator from \cite{Par24} to the multivariable case. These combine into the Jacobian profunctor which provides the setting for a lax chain rule. We introduce a functorial version of multivariable Newton series whose aim is to recover a functor from its iterated differences. Not all functors are recovered but we get a best approximation in the form of a left adjoint, and the induced comonad is idempotent. Its fixed points are what we call soft analytic functors, a generalization of the multivariable analytic functors of Fiore et al.~\cite{FioGamHylWin08}.</description>

      <title>Positively closed $Sh(B)$-valued models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study positively closed and strongly positively closed topos-valued models of coherent theories. Positively closed is a global notion (it is defined in terms of all possible outgoing homomorphisms), while strongly positively closed is a local notion (it only concerns the definable sets inside the model). For $\mathbf{Set}$-valued models of coherent theories they coincide.
  We prove that if $\mathcal{E}=Sh(B,\tau _{coh})$ for a complete Boolean algebra, then positively closed but not strongly positively closed $\mathcal{E}$-valued models of coherent theories exist, yet, there is an alternative local property which characterizes positively closed $\mathcal{E}$-valued models.
  A large part of our discussion is given in the context of infinite quantifier geometric logic, dealing with the fragment $L^g_{\kappa \kappa }$ where $\kappa $ is weakly compact.</description>

      <title>Riguet congruences, Generalized congruences and Free monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine Riguet congruences and generalized congruences on a category, giving particular attention to their interrelations from both lattice-theoretic and category-theoretic perspectives. This investigation constitutes the principal contribution of the paper. As an application of these results, starting from a category associated with the free monoid on a set $A$ of sorts, we obtain a skeletal category via the quotient of that category by a suitable Riguet congruence on it. Moreover, we prove that this quotient category is equivalent to the category of finite $A$-sorted sets, while being neither a subcategory of it nor identical to the category of finite $A$-sorted cardinal numbers.</description>

      <title>The Magmoid of Normalized Stochastic Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normalization, $D(X + 1) \to D(X) + 1$, is almost a distributive law; but because one of the distributive law axioms only holds up-to-idempotent, it yields a non-associative composition of normalized kernels. We introduce the Markov magmoid of normalized stochastic kernels: a normalized-by-construction semantics for probabilistic inference, unifying exact Bayesian observations and interventions as two parenthesizations of the same composite. Front-door and back-door criteria follow from the axioms of Markov magmoids; we implement these with non-associative monadic notation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the compatibility of pushforward along a proper morphism of an \'{e}tale constructible sheaf and the pushforward of its characteristic cycle up to $p$-torsion. This was conjectured by Takeshi Saito. For this, we revisit the construction of the characteristic cycle, due to Saito and Beilinson, from more homotopical point of view. In particular, the language of $\infty$-categories is indispensable to carry this out.</description>

      <title>Conjectures on the reduced Kronecker coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a series of conjectures on the stable tensor product of irreducible representations of symmetric groups, which are closely related to the reduced Kronecker coefficients. These conjectures are certain generalizations of Okounkov's conjecture on the log-concavity of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the Schur log-concavity theorem of Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy. We prove our conjectures in some special cases and discuss some implications of these conjectures.</description>

      <title>The center of the asymptotic Hecke category and unipotent character sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Lusztig [Bull. Inst. Math. Acad. Sin. (N.S.)10(2015), no.1, 1-72] showed that for a connected reductive group over an algebraic closure of a finite field the associated (geometric) Hecke category admits a truncation in a two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell, making it a categorification of the asymptotic algebra (J-ring), and that the categorical center of this "asymptotic Hecke category" is equivalent to the category of unipotent character sheaves supported in the cell. Subsequently, Lusztig noted that an asymptotic Hecke category can be constructed for any finite Coxeter group using Soergel bimodules. Lusztig conjectured that the centers of these categories are modular tensor categories (which was then proven by Elias and Williamson) and that for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups the S-matrices coincide with the Fourier matrices that were constructed in the 1990s by Lusztig, Malle, and Brou\'e--Malle. If the conjecture is true, the centers may be considered as categories of "unipotent character sheaves" for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups.
  In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for dihedral groups and for some (we cannot resolve all) cells of H3 and H4. The key ingredient is the method of H-reduction and the identification of the (reduced) asymptotic Hecke category with known categories whose center is already known as well. We conclude by studying the asymptotic Hecke category and its center for some infinite Coxeter groups with a finite cell.</description>

      <title>Cubical Approximation for Directed Topology II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes an equivalence between directed homotopy categories of (diagrams of) cubical sets and (diagrams of) directed topological spaces. This equivalence both lifts and extends an equivalence between classical homotopy categories of cubical sets and topological spaces. Some simple applications include combinatorial descriptions and subsequent calculations of directed homotopy monoids and directed singular 1-cohomology monoids. Another application is a characterization of isomorphisms between small categories up to zig-zags of natural transformations as directed homotopy equivalences between directed classifying spaces. Cubical sets throughout the paper are taken to mean presheaves over the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category. Along the way, the paper characterizes morphisms in this variant as the interval-preserving lattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graded-commutative ring acting centrally on a triangulated category, our main result shows that if cohomology of a pair of objects of the triangulated category is finitely generated over the ring acting centrally, then the asymptotic vanishing of the cohomology is well-behaved. In particular, enough consecutive asymptotic vanishing of cohomology implies all eventual vanishing. Several key applications are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an idempotent complete additive category, we show the there is an explicitly constructed topological space such that the lattice of exact substructures is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of closed subsets. In the special case that the additive category has weak cokernels, this topological space is an open subset of the Ziegler spectrum and this is a result of Kevin Schlegel. We also look at some module categories of rings where the Ziegler spectrum is known and calculate the global dimensions of the corresponding exact substructures. Second version contains minor changes to first version.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>
