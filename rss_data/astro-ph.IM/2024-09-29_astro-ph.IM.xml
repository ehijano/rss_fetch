      <title>SST-1M : Commissioning and Preliminary Observation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SST-1M is a single-mirror small size Cherenkov telescope prototype developed by a consortium among institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. With a 9.42 m$^2$ multi-segment mirror and a 5.6 m focal length, SST-1Ms have a broad 9 degree field of view and aim to detect gamma-rays spanning the energy range of 1 to 300 TeV. The DigiCam camera incorporates a compact Photo-Detector Plane comprising 1296 hexagonal silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels and a fully digital readout and trigger system using a 250 MHz ADC.
  Currently undergoing commissioning at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, two SST-1M telescopes are actively collecting data through observations of astrophysical gamma-ray sources. This presentation provides an overview of the telescope, camera design, and analysis pipeline, including evaluations of the instrument's responses. Preliminary results derived from ongoing observations are presented. A specific focus on data analysis of stereoscopic observations of the Crab Nebula provide insights on the telescope's sensitivity and performances.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SST-1M is a prototype of a single-mirror Small Size Telescope developed by a consortium of institutes from Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. With a wide field of view of 9 degrees, SST-1Ms are designed to detect gamma-rays in the energy range between 1 and 300 TeV. The design of the SST-1M follows the Davies-Cotton concept, with a 9.42m2 multi-segment mirror. SST-1M is equipped with DigiCam camera, which features a fully digital readout and trigger system using 250 MHz ADC, and a compact Photo-Detector Plane (PDP) composed of 1296 pixels, each made of a hexagonal light guide coupled to silicone photomultipliers (SiPM).
  Two SST-1M telescopes are currently being commissioned at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, where they are successfully observing Cerenkov events in stereo. This contribution will present an overview of calibration strategies and performance evaluation based on data collected at the observatory.</description>

      <title>Standardised formats and open-source analysis tools for the MAGIC telescopes data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruments for gamma-ray astronomy at Very High Energies ($E&gt;100\,{\rm GeV}$) have traditionally derived their scientific results through proprietary data and software. Data standardisation has become a prominent issue in this field both as a requirement for the dissemination of data from the next generation of gamma-ray observatories and as an effective solution to realise public data legacies of current-generation instruments. Specifications for a standardised gamma-ray data format have been proposed as a community effort and have already been successfully adopted by several instruments.
  We present the first production of standardised data from the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. We converted $166\,{\rm h}$ of observations from different sources and validated their analysis with the open-source software Gammapy.
  We consider six data sets representing different scientific and technical analysis cases and compare the results obtained analysing the standardised data with open-source software against those produced with the MAGIC proprietary data and software. Aiming at a systematic production of MAGIC data in this standardised format, we also present the implementation of a database-driven pipeline automatically performing the MAGIC data reduction from the calibrated down to the standardised data level.
  In all the cases selected for the validation, we obtain results compatible with the MAGIC proprietary software, both for the manual and for the automatic data productions. Part of the validation data set is also made publicly available, thus representing the first large public release of MAGIC data.
  This effort and this first data release represent a technical milestone toward the realisation of a public MAGIC data legacy.</description>

      <title>ExoLyn: a golden mean approach to multi-species cloud modelling in atmospheric retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Clouds are ubiquitous in exoplanets' atmospheres and play an important role in setting the opacity and chemical inventory of the atmosphere. Understanding clouds is a critical step in interpreting exoplanets' spectroscopic data. Aims. The aim is to model the multi-species nature of clouds in atmospheric retrieval studies. To this end, we develop ExoLyn - a 1D cloud model that balances physical consistency with computational efficiency. Methods. ExoLyn solves the transport equation of cloud particles and vapor under cloud condensation rates that are self-consistently calculated from thermodynamics. ExoLyn is a standalone, open source package capable to be combined with \texttt{optool} to calculate solid opacities and with \texttt{petitRADTRANS} to generate transmission or emission spectra. Results. With ExoLyn we find that the compositional structure of clouds in hot Jupiter planets' atmospheres is layered with a cloud dominated by magnesium-silicates on top of an iron cloud. This finding is consistent with more complex cloud formation models but can be obtained with ExoLyn in only a few seconds. The composition of the cloud particles can be constrained from the spectrum, for example, MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 components give rise to an absorption feature at 8 - 10 um. We investigate the dependence of the cloud structure on the bulk elemental composition of the planet and find that SiO2-dominated clouds forms on metal-rich planet and Fe clouds with strong extinction effect forms on C-rich planet. Conclusions. Designed towards maximum flexibility, ExoLyn can also be used in retrieval analysis of sub-Neptunes and self-luminous planets. The efficiency of ExoLyn opens the possibility of joint retrieval of exoplanets' gas and cloud components.</description>

      <title>The Blending ToolKit: A simulation framework for evaluation of galaxy detection and deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an open source Python library for simulating overlapping (i.e., blended) images of galaxies and performing self-consistent comparisons of detection and deblending algorithms based on a suite of metrics. The package, named Blending Toolkit (BTK), serves as a modular, flexible, easy-to-install, and simple-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing systematic effects related to blended galaxies in cosmological surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). BTK has three main components: (1) a set of modules that perform fast image simulations of blended galaxies, using the open source image simulation package GalSim; (2) a module that standardizes the inputs and outputs of existing deblending algorithms; (3) a library of deblending metrics commonly defined in the galaxy deblending literature. In combination, these modules allow researchers to explore the impacts of galaxy blending in cosmological surveys. Additionally, BTK provides researchers who are developing a new deblending algorithm a framework to evaluate algorithm performance and make principled comparisons with existing deblenders. BTK includes a suite of tutorials and comprehensive documentation. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/BlendingToolKit.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination data for astrophysical applications: Plasma rate-coefficients for Fe^q+ (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni^25+ ions from storage-ring experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3678</link>
      <description>arXiv:1002.3678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review summarizes the present status of an ongoing experimental effort to provide reliable rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of highly charged iron ions for the modeling of astrophysical and other plasmas. The experimental work has been carried out over more than a decade at the heavy-ion storage-ring TSR of the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The experimental and data reduction procedures are outlined. The role of previously disregarded processes such as fine-structure core excitations and trielectronic recombination is highlighted. Plasma rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of Fe$^{q+}$ ions (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni$^{25+}$ are presented graphically and in a simple parameterized form allowing for easy use in plasma modeling codes. It is concluded that storage-ring experiments are presently the only source for reliable low-temperature dielectronic recombination rate-coefficients of complex ions.</description>

      <title>TDI noises transfer functions for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LISA mission is the future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory of the European Space Agency. It is formed by 3 spacecraft exchanging laser beams in order to form multiple real and virtual interferometers. The data streams to be used in order to extract the large number and variety of GW sources are Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) data. One important processing to produce these data is the TDI on-ground processing which recombines multiple interferometric on-board measurements to remove certain noise sources from the data such as laser frequency noise or spacecraft jitter. The LISA noise budget is therefore expressed at the TDI level in order to account for the different TDI transfer functions applied for each noise source and thus estimate their real weight on mission performance. In order to derive a usable form of these transfer functions, a model of the beams, the measurements, and TDI have been developed, and several approximation have been made. A methodology for such a derivation has been established, as well as verification procedures. It results in a set of transfer functions, which are now used by the LISA project, in particular in its performance model. Using these transfer functions, realistic noise curves for various instrumental configurations are provided to data analysis algorithms and used for instrument design.</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): III. Understanding the DTARPS Candidate Transiting Planet Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS) project, using novel statistical methods, has identified several hundred candidates for transiting planetary systems obtained from 0.9 million Full Frame Image light curves obtained in the TESS Year 1 southern hemisphere survey (Melton et al. 2024a and 2024b). Several lines of evidence, including limited reconnaissance spectroscopy, indicate that at least half are true planets rather than False Positives. Here various population properties of these objects are examined. Half of the DTARPS candidates are hot Neptunes, populating the 'Neptune desert' found in Kepler planet samples. The DTARPS samples also identify dozens of Ultra Short Period planets with orbital periods down to 5 hours, high priority systems for atmospheric transimssion spectroscopy, and planets orbiting low-mass M stars. DTARPS methodology is sufficiently well-characterized at each step that preliminary planet occurrence rates can be estimated. Except for the increase in hot Neptunes, DTARPS planet occurrence rates are consistent with Kepler rates. Overall, DTARPS provides one of the largest and most reliable catalog of TESS exoplanet candidates that can be tapped to improve our understanding of various exoplanetary populations and astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Study of longitudinal development of air showers in the knee energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based cosmic ray experiments detect cosmic ray mainly by measuring the longitudinal and lateral distribution of secondary particles produced in the extensive air shower (EAS). The EAS of cosmic ray in the knee energy region is simulated via CORSIKA software. Several simulation samples with different energy, composition and zenith angles were carried out to understand the longitudinal development of electron, muon and Cherenkov light in EAS. All the results presented were obtained assuming an observation plane at an altitude of 4400 m a.s.l. The differences of longitudinal development between electron and Cherenkov light were studied, and the reconstruction uncertainty of shower maximum for electron from Cherenkov light was estimated to be 10-15g/cm$^2$ for nuclei above 1 PeV. The performances of energy measurement and the composition discrimination ability based on longitudinal development were studied and compared with that from lateral distribution. It was found that number of electron per depth at its shower maximum has the smallest shower-to-shower fluctuations, but the shower-to-shower fluctuations of electron density measured at observation level was very close to it when the appropriate zenith angle was employed. The shower-to-shower fluctuations of shower maximum for electron is 50-55 g/cm$^2$ for proton, and 20-25 g/cm$^2$ for iron, but the composition discrimination ability between nuclei from muon density measured at observation level is much better than the shower maximum variable from longitudinal development. The hadronic model dependencies of the longitudinal development and lateral distribution were also discussed.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of frequency downconverted arm length stabilization for a future upgraded gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.</description>

Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS) have a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Recently, systematic discrepancies between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances have been found to exceed a factor of 2 - 5, with NUV-derived abundances appearing enhanced for a wide array of comets. Interpretation of cometary CS emission in the ultraviolet has relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations whose accuracy can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to v = 8 and rotational states up to N = 100. The models utilize a new set of band transition rates derived from laboratory electron impact experiments. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield) show favorable agreement with the fluorescence models. The present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of CS abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emission in comets with IUE and HST, but do not explain the consistent enhancement of NUV-derived CS abundances relative to the radio measurements during the same apparitions. Alternative explanations of the factor of 2 - 5 discrepancy between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances are discussed, as well as possible connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available on the Zenodo service.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions from spectro-photometric data. We built a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra), without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we used high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic stellar surveys, complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have reported parallaxes. We have achieved median uncertainties of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeeded in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone or spectral-energy distribution fitting methods we employed in earlier works, especially for parameters $A_V$ and $T_{\rm eff}$, along with the metallicity values. Finally, we showcase some potential applications of this new catalogue, including extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, and extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>

Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>
