      <title>From Supernovae to Neutron Stars: A Systematic Approach to Axion Production at Finite Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of QCD axion production in environments with finite baryon density and temperature, implying significant changes to axion phenomenology. Within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, we derive the effective Lagrangian describing axion interactions with nucleons and mesons up to next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion. We focus on corrections to the axion-nucleon couplings from higher orders and finite density. These couplings are modified by up to an order of magnitude near nuclear saturation density, significantly impacting axion production in supernovae and neutron stars. Density-dependent corrections enhance the axion luminosity in supernovae by an order of magnitude, strengthening current best bounds by a factor of three. We stress the importance of including all axion production channels up to a given chiral order for a consistent luminosity calculation and classify the missing contributions up to the third chiral order. The modified axion-nucleon couplings also affect neutron star cooling rates via axion emission. A re-evaluation of existing neutron star cooling bounds, constrained to regions where perturbative control is reliable, weakens these bounds by a factor of four. Lastly, our results have implications for terrestrial axion searches that rely on precise knowledge of axion-nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future neutrino research program will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for Charge-Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) scattering, on the combination of "nucleon physics" expressed by form factors and "nuclear physics" expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. This talk presents a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas (CFG) Model for CCQE electron-nuclei and neutrino-nuclei scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Higher precision constraints on the tau $g-2$ in LHC photon-initiated production: a full account of hadron dissociation and soft survival effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of photon-initiated $\tau$ pair production in the presence of non-zero anomalous magnetic ($a_\tau$) and/or electric dipole ($d_\tau$) moments of the $\tau$ lepton that accounts for the non-trivial interplay between these modifications with the soft survival factor and the possibility of dissociation of the hadron (proton or ion) beam. The impact of these is on general grounds not expected to have a uniform dependence on the value of $a_\tau, d_\tau$, but in all previous analyses this assumption has been made. We have therefore investigated the importance of these effects in the context of photon-initiated $\tau$ pair production in both pp and PbPb collisions. This is in general found to be relatively small, at the percent level in terms of any extracted limits or observations of $a_\tau, d_\tau$, such that these effects can indeed be safely ignored in existing experimental analyses. However, as the precision of such determinations increases in the future, the relevance of these effects will likewise increase. With this in mind we have made our calculation publicly available in the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator, including the possibility to simulate this process for varying $a_\tau, d_\tau$ without rerunning.</description>

      <title>Constraining New Physics with $h\rightarrow VV$ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of quantum information methods to high energy physics has recently been gaining traction. In particular, reconstructing density matrices and measuring entanglement have been investigated for top quark decays and Higgs decays. This paper will further investigate the utility of density matrices for Higgs decays to vector bosons. Imprints of new physics, whether CP-even or CP-odd, in $h \rightarrow VV$ will generally change the spin density matrix, and so the tomographic reconstruction of the density matrix can constrain, or potentially detect, such new physics. New physics, expressed in the language of the Standard Model effective field theory, is analyzed in this framework of quantum tomography. Prospects for $h \rightarrow WW$ are good due to the fully chiral coupling of the $W$ boson to fermions, while $h \rightarrow ZZ$ requires around an order of magnitude more events to reach comparable sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The inflation trilogy and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an inflation scenario with three independent stages of cold, warm and thermal inflation, respectively, driven by different scalar fields, motivated by the large number of such fields predicted in most extensions of the Standard Model. We show, in particular, that the intermediate period of warm inflation naturally leads to large density fluctuations on small scales, which can lead to primordial black hole formation in the mass window where they may account for all dark matter. This type of scenario yields a distinctive primordial black hole mass function with a mass gap, with the final period of thermal inflation diluting the abundance of very light black holes.</description>

      <title>Top Quark Electroweak Dipole Moment at a High Energy Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity reach to probe the electroweak dipole operators associated with a top quark at a multi-TeV lepton collider. Studying the electroweak dipole operators is strongly motivated by precision physics. The operators exhibit unique chiral structure and can be enhanced with respect to others in theories beyond the Standard Model. We illustrate this point in a strongly coupled composite Higgs model. We find that a high energy $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider may offer unique opportunity to probe the electroweak dipole operators beyond the coverage by the LHC and future hadron colliders. The significant sensitivity is achieved by the leading channel $\mu^+ \mu^- \to t \bar t$ near the threshold, and substantially improved by the novel channel $\mu^+ \mu^- \to t \bar t h$ at high energies. We may be able to reach a new physics scale well above the collider energy for moderate couplings of the Wilson coefficients. Our main conclusions are applicable to future $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Symmetries from outer automorphisms and unorthodox group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries play an essential role in the construction and phenomenology of quantum field theories (QFTs). We discuss how to construct symmetries of QFTs by extending minimal "seed" symmetry groups to larger groups that contain the seed(s) as subgroup(s). On the one hand, there are so-called "normal" extensions, which are given by outer automorphisms of the original symmetry group (including the trivial one) and contain the seed as a normal subgroup. On the other hand, there can be "unorthodox extensions" which do not have this property. We demonstrate our logic on the most general scalar potentials of the two- and three-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM and 3HDM). For the 2HDM, we show that all symmetry groups, including the different possible classes of CP and continuous symmetry groups, can be obtained from extensions of the smallest possible symmetry CP1 by consecutive outer automorphisms. Scanning over normal and unorthodox group extensions might be the easiest way to "machine learn" the possible symmetries of a QFT. However, many of the groups constructible in this way may not be realizable in a concrete model, in the sense that they lead to additional accidental symmetries. Hence, we also comment on a different, "top-down" way to obtain the possible realizable symmetry groups of a QFT based on the covariant transformation of couplings under the most general basis changes.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the semileptonic $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>Unified Interpretation of 95 GeV Excesses in the Two Higgs Doublet type II Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for a light Higgs boson, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have observed excesses in both the diphoton ($\gamma\gamma$) and di-tau-pair ($\tau^+\tau^-$) decay channels at about $95$ GeV. The LEP collaboration has also previously reported an excess in the $b\bar{b}$ channel at a comparable Higgs mass. In this paper, we explore whether these excesses can be accommodated within the framework of the Two Higgs Doublet type II Seesaw Model (2HDMcT). By implementing various theoretical constraints and experimental limits on the parameter space, we first demonstrate that a light CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$, with a mass around 95 GeV can simultaneously account for the excesses observed in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}$ channels, provided a Type I Yukawa texture is employed. More interestingly, our analysis shows that the three excesses in $\gamma\gamma$, $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ channels can well be accommodated simultaneously, reaching a $0.64 \sigma$ C.L. if the CP-odd Higgs boson $A_1$ is nearly mass degenerate and superposed to the light CP-even Higgs $h_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Experimental Road to a Charming Family of Tetraquarks ... and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of the X(3872) meson in 2003 ignited intense interest in exotic (neither $q\bar{q}$ nor $qqq$) hadrons, but a $c\bar{c}$ interpretation of this state was difficult to exclude. An unequivocal exotic was discovered in the $Z_c(3900)^+$ meson -- a charged charmonium-like state. A variety of models of exotic structure have been advanced but consensus is elusive. The grand lesson from heavy quarkonia was that heavy quarks bring clarity. Thus, the recently reported triplet of all-charm tetraquark candidates -- $X(6600)$, $X(6900)$, and $X(7100)$ -- decaying to $J/\psi\,J/\psi$ is a great boon, promising important insights. We review some history of exotics, chronicle the road to prospective all-charm tetraquarks, discuss in some detail the divergent modeling of $J/\psi\,J/\psi$ structures, and offer some inferences about them. These states form a Regge trajectory and appear to be a family of radial excitations. A reported, but unexplained, threshold excess could hint at a fourth family member. We close with a brief look at a step beyond: all-bottom tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Implications of electromagnetic scale anomaly to QCD chiral phase transition in smaller quark mass regime: $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ does not drop with eB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decrease of the chiral pseudocritical temperature $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ with an applied strong magnetic field has been extensively investigated by various QCD low energy effective models and lattice QCD at physical point. We find that this decreasing feature may not hold in the case with a weak magnetic field and still depends on quark masses: when the quark masses get smaller, $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ increases with the weak magnetic field. This happens due to the significant electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution in the thermomagnetic medium. We demonstrate this salient feature by employing the Polyakov Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with 2+1 quark flavors including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution. We observe a critical point in a sort of the Columbia plot, $(m_{0c}, m_{sc}) \simeq (3, 30) \mathrm{MeV}$ for the isospin symmetric up and down quark mass $m_0$ and the strange quark mass $m_s$, where $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ decreases with the magnetic field if the quark masses are greater than those values, and increases with the magnetic field if the quark masses are less than them.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS and transition GPDs: A unified framework for spinless hadron case $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) extend the concept of hadron-to-resonance transition GPDs and provide a unified description of non-diagonal hard exclusive reactions in the generalized Bjorken limit. We present the formalism for the case of spinless hadrons addressing the non-diagonal deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^*\pi\to\gamma\pi\pi$ in terms of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs, which generalize GPDs for $\pi \to f_0, \, \rho, \, f_2, \, \cdots$ transitions. We work out the basic properties of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs and establish the soft pion theorems at the $2\pi$ production threshold. We construct the partial wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles and employ the dispersive approach to constrain $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of $\pi\pi$-scattering phases with help of the Omn\`{e}s representation. We estimate the $e^-\pi^+ \to e^- \gamma \pi^+ \pi^0$ cross section in the kinematics of the JLab@12 GeV incorporating the isolated $\rho(770)$ resonance state and work out the angular distributions of the cross section, specifying the observables sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo results on the Collins asymmetries in $e^+e^-$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark spin effects have been introduced in the Pythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator for the simulation of $e^+e^-$ annihilation by interfacing the generator with the StringSpinner package. The package allows to simulate quark spin effects in the string fragmentation routine of Pythia by using the string+${}^3P_0$ model, recently applied to the fragmentation of a string stretched between a quark-antiquark pair with correlated spin states. StringSpinner is used to carry out simulations of $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the center of mass energy of $10.6\,\rm{GeV}$. The Collins asymmetries are extracted from the simulated data for back-to-back pion pairs using both the thrust axis method and the hadronic plane method. The results are compared with the data from the BELLE and BABAR experiments, finding a satisfactory agreement.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group running effects in $pp \to t\bar{t}h$ in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of renormalization group running of the Wilson coefficients in the SMEFT in the context of single Higgs production in association with a top-antitop pair. In particular, we analyze the differential cross section with respect to the Higgs trasnverse momentum. We extend the usual ${O}({\alpha_s})$ analysis including also the top Yukawa running effects, whose impact can be significant when large Wilson coefficients are considered. We employ a dynamical and a fixed renormalization scale with different set-ups for the Wilson coefficients, defined at the TeV scale. Additionally, we comment on the accuracy of the widely-used first leading-logarithm approximation.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts induced by light scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Double parton distributions of the proton from basis light-front quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we systematically investigate the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized double parton distributions (DPDs) of quarks inside the proton. We utilize the light-front wave functions of the proton derived in the valence sector from a Hamiltonian quantized on the light-front. The interaction terms of the Hamiltonian consist of a one-gluon exchange interaction at fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. Our current analysis yields significant correlations of the quarks' longitudinal momenta with their transverse separation. We also demonstrate that our calculations do not support the commonly used $x-\vec{k}_\perp$ factorization of the DPDs in $x$ and $k_\perp$. Our results are qualitatively consistent with those of other phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $N$-point energy correlator in the collinear limit, the largest projected angle $R$ in the large $N$ limit can be viewed as the radius of the jet that encompasses all the collinear core particles, while contributions from soft gluons to the radius are suppressed. We relate the $N$-point energy correlator in the large $N$ limit to the moments of the fragmentation functions to a jet, and, using previous work, we compare the difference between jets initiated by heavy quarks and light quarks. This comparison reveals the deadcone effect.</description>

      <title>The effect of multiple extra dimensions on the maximal mass of compact stars in Kaluza-Klein space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time are investigated, with multiple additional compactified spatial dimensions ($d$). Within the extended phenomenological model, a static, spherically symmetric solution is considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multi-dimensional Fermi gas. The maximal masses of compact stars are calculated for different model parameters. We investigated the effect of the existence of multiple extra compactified dimensions within the Kaluza-Klein compact star structure. We found that the number of extra dimensions plays a similar role, and to a similar order, as the excitation number: increasing their number, $d$, reduces the maximal mass by a few percent.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long multidimensional general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarfs (WDs). Our findings show that, with sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields and rotation, these systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230703A. Notably, our models reproduce the power and duration of these LGRBs and the associated kilonovae without the need for tuning parameters. Additionally, our results suggest that the AIC of WDs could be an important site of the production for heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the catalog pulsars dominating the Galactic positron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray flux of positrons is measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. The hypothesis that pulsars and their nebulae can significantly contribute to the excess of the AMS-02 positron flux has been consolidated after the observation of a $\gamma$-ray emission at GeV and TeV energies of a few degree size around a few sources, that provide indirect evidence that electron and positron pairs are accelerated to very high energies from these sources. By modeling the emission from pulsars in the ATNF catalog, we find that combinations of positron emission from cataloged pulsars and secondary production can fit the observed AMS-02 data. Our results show that a small number of nearby, middle-aged pulsars, particularly B1055-52, Geminga (J0633+1746), and Monogem (B0656+14), dominate the positron emission, contributing up to 80\% of the flux at energies above 100 GeV. From the fit to the data, we obtain a list of the most important sources for which we recommend multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, to further constrain the injection and diffusion properties of positrons.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Axio-dilaton Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

Abstract: Spectral densities encode non-perturbative information crucial in computing physical observables in strongly coupled field theories. Using lattice gauge theory data, we perform a systematic study to demonstrate the potential of recent technological advances in the reconstruction of spectral densities. We develop, maintain and make publicly available dedicated analysis code that can be used for broad classes of lattice theories. As a test case, we analyse the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to an admixture of fermions transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. We measure the masses of mesons in energy-smeared spectral densities, after optimising the smearing parameters for available lattice ensembles. We present a summary of the mesons mass spectrum in all the twelve (flavored) channels available, including also several excited states.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the textbook formula for the pressure of free massless fermions leads to negative values of the probability mass function of the distribution of the system of free massless fermions in the fermion number. The ways to resolve this paradox are proposed. A detailed analysis of the corresponding partition function indicates the presence of a Roberge-Weiss transition in the absence of strong interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the masses of the pseudoscalar flavour-singlet meson states in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation and three Dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation. This theory provides a compelling ultraviolet completion for the minimal composite Higgs model implementing also partial compositeness for the top quark. The spectrum contains two, comparatively light, pseudoscalar flavour-singlet states, which mix with one another. One of them is a Nambu-Goldstone boson (in the massless limit), whereas the other receives a mass from the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. We demonstrate how to measure the mixing between these two states. For moderately heavy fermion masses, we find that the two wave functions are dominated by one of the fermion representations, mixing effects being small.</description>

      <title>Novel Search for Light Dark Photon in the Forward Experiments at the LHC</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for discovering a light dark photon in the forward experiments at the LHC, including the SND@LHC and the FASER experiments. Assuming the dark photon is lighter than twice the electron mass and feebly interacts with ordinary matter, it is long-lived enough to pass through 100 m of rock in front of the forward experiments and also through the detector targets. However, some portion of them could be converted into an electron-positron pair inside the detector through their interaction with the detector target, leaving an isolated electromagnetic shower as a clear new physics signature of the dark photon. With copiously produced dark photons from neutral pion decays in the forward region of the LHC, we expect to observe sizable events inside the detector. Our estimation shows that more than 10 signal events of the dark photon could be observed in the range of kinetic mixing parameter, $6.2\times10^{-5} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 2\times10^{-1}$ and $3\times10^{-5} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 2\times10^{-1}$ for dark photon mass $m_{A^\prime} \lesssim$ 1 MeV with integrated luminosities of 150 fb$^{-1}$ and 3 ab$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of global string networks and the axion dark matter mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold dark matter axions produced in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scenario serve as clear targets for their experimental detection, since it is in principle possible to give a sharp prediction for their mass once we understand precisely how they are produced from the decay of global cosmic strings in the early Universe. In this paper, we perform a dedicated analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the Peccei-Quinn field on a static lattice. Making full use of the massively parallel code and computing resources, we executed the simulations with up to $11264^3$ lattice sites, which allows us to improve our understanding of the dependence on the parameter controlling the string tension and thus give a more accurate extrapolation of the numerical results. We found that there are several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects, some of which could explain the discrepancy in the literature. We confirmed the trend that the spectral index of the axion emission spectrum increases with the string tension, but did not find a clear evidence of whether it continues to increase or saturates to a constant at larger values of the string tension due to the severe discretisation effects. Taking this uncertainty into account and performing the extrapolation with a simple power law assumption on the spectrum, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted in the range of $m_a \approx 95$-$450\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Transition of dimuonium through foil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a study of the passage of dimuonium through the foil of ordinary matter. First, we provide an overview of how dimuonium is planned to be produced for such a type of experiment and how it is expected to interact with the ordinary atoms -- predominantly electromagnetically via the screened coulomb potential of the atomic nuclei. Then, we describe the transport equations that represent the evolution of dimuonium states during the passage and their solution methods. Finally, for three different foils (Beryllium, Aluminium and Lead), we present the results of this study. To estimate impact of uncertainties in the potential of a target atom, we study 15 different approximations of the atomic potential and show that the corresponding atomic-potential-model-dependent error in the yields of the low lying states of dimuonium is quite small within the framework of the applied Born approximation. The convergence of the results after truncation of the infinite system of transport equations to the finite number of quantum states of dimuonium is also studied, and good convergence for the yields of low-lying states is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Model-independent extrapolation of MUonE data with Pad\'e and D-Log approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment is designed to extract the hadronic contribution to the electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$, from elastic $e\mu$ scattering. The leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$, $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP, \,LO}}$, can then be obtained from a weighted integral over $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$. This, however, requires knowledge of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$ in the whole domain of integration, which cannot be achieved by experiment. In this work, we propose to use Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants as a systematic and model-independent method to fit and reliably extrapolate the future MUonE experimental data, extracting $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$ with a conservative but competitive uncertainty, using no, or very limited, external information. The method relies on fundamental analytic properties of the two-point correlator underlying $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$ and provides lower and upper bounds for the result for $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$. We demonstrate the reliability of the method using toy data sets generated from a model for $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$ reflecting the expected statistics of the MUonE experiment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the decoupling limit of the Georgi-Machacek model with a scalar singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between collider and dark matter phenomenology in the singlet extension of the Georgi-Machacek model. In this framework, the singlet scalar serves as a suitable thermal dark matter (DM) candidate. Our focus lies on the region $v_{\chi}&lt;1$ GeV, where $v_{\chi}$ is the common vacuum expectation value of the neutral components of the scalar triplets of the model. Setting bounds on the model parameters from theoretical, electroweak precision and LHC experimental constraints, we find that the BSM Higgs sector is highly constrained. Allowed values for the masses of the custodial fiveplets, triplets and singlet are restricted to the range $140~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H_5} &lt; 350~ {\rm GeV }$, $150~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H_3} &lt; 270 ~{\rm GeV }$ and $145~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H} &lt; 300~ {\rm GeV }$. The extended scalar sector provides new channels for DM annihilation into BSM scalars that allow to satisfy the observed relic density constraint while being consistent with direct DM detection limits. The allowed region of the parameter space of the model can be explored in the upcoming DM detection experiments, both direct and indirect. In particular, the possible high values of BR$(H^0_5\to\gamma\gamma)$ can lead to an indirect DM signal within the reach of CTA. The same feature also provides the possibility of exploring the model at the High-Luminosity run of the LHC. In a simple cut-based analysis, we find that a signal of about $4\sigma$ significance can be achieved in final states with at least two photons for one of our benchmark points.</description>

      <title>Majorana phases beyond neutrinoless double beta decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\nu_M{\rm SM}$ is defined as the SM extended to include dimension-5 operators. In this model neutrino masses violate lepton number, and two parameters of the lepton mixing matrix, the Majorana phases, are yet to be constrained. One combination of these phases and the neutrino masses, often denoted by $m_{ee}$, is probed by neutrinoless double beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$). We explore what information may be obtained beyond $0\nu\beta\beta$, and how it depends on the lightest neutrino mass. We point out that with current central values of the mixing parameters, $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_e=\Delta L_\mu = 1$ (or $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_\mu = 2$) processes cannot simultaneously vanish, providing a no-lose theorem, in principle, for excluding the $\nu_M{\rm SM}$, even in the case of normal mass ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension in the large scale structure can be explained by decaying dark matter with an almost degenerate spectrum and small enough decay width. Here we propose the Gemini dark matter model, which contains a heavy mother particle $\chi_3$ and two twins $\chi_{1/2}$ which are almost degenerate in mass and are produced at the same time. The dark sector is charged under the same Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry that can explain the hierarchy of the Standard model Yukawa couplings. The slightly heavier $\chi_2$ decays into $\chi_1$ and the axionic component of the flavon, which washes out the small scale structure and resolves $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension. We present the production mechanism of Gemini dark matter and viable parameter regions. We find that despite the preferred dark matter mass being $\mathcal{O}(1)$--$\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV, they constitute cold dark matter. The Gemini dark matter model predicts an abundance of dark radiation that will be probed in future measurements of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs potential is likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation requires an extension of the SM to sufficiently stabilise the Higgs potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$. We consider isosinglet $T$ and $B$ vector quarks. Requiring stability of the finite temperature effective potential, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The upper bounds are generally smaller for $B$ vector quarks and are sensitive to the $t$-quark mass. The inflation predictions depend upon the conformal frame in which the model is renormalised. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger upper bound on $m_{Q}$ in Prescription II than the requirement of stability. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Hunting for bileptons at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review possible signals at hadron colliders of bileptons, namely doubly-charged vectors or scalars with lepton number L=+/- 2, as predicted by a 331 model, based on a SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x U(1)_X symmetry. In particular, I account for a version of the 331 model, wherein the embedding of the hypercharge is obtained with the addition of 3 exotic quarks and vector bileptons. Furthermore, a sextet of SU(3)_L, necessary to give masses to leptons, yields an extra scalar sector, including a doubly-charged Higgs, i.e. scalar bileptons. As bileptons are mostly produced in pairs at hadron colliders, their main signal is given by two same-sign lepton pairs at high invariant mass. Nevertheless, they can also decay according to non-leptonic modes, such as a TeV-scale heavy quark, charged 4/3 or 5/3, plus a Standard Model quark. I explore both leptonic and non-leptonic decays and the sensitivity to such processes of present and future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal matrix in the Casas-Ibarra parametrization for the Yukawa interactions of Majorana neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Casas-Ibarra (CI) parametrization of the Yukawa coupling matrix of Majorana neutrinos is generalized by considering the exact seesaw relation and including non-unitarity of the $3 \times 3$ Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) flavor mixing matrix. With the help of a full $6 \times 6$ Euler-like block description of the flavor structure for the seesaw mechanism, we find that the orthogonal matrix $\mathbb{O}$ in the CI parametrization can be expressed as $\mathbb{O}^{}_{ij} = \sqrt{M^{}_j/m^{}_i} \hspace{0.05cm} F^{}_{ij}$ with $m^{}_i$ and $M^{}_j$ being the masses of light and heavy Majorana neutrinos and $F^{}_{ij}$ consisting of the PMNS and active-sterile flavor mixing parameters (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$). Assuming a specific pattern of $\mathbb{O}$ is therefore equivalent to imposing some special conditions on the seesaw parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we entertain a Machian setting where local physics is non-locally affected by the whole Universe, taking the liberty to identify the local (``Newton's bucket'') with our visible Universe, and the whole Universe (Mach's ``fixed stars'') with the global Universe beyond our horizon. Crucially, we allow for the two to have different properties, so that we are beyond the traditional FRW setting. For definiteness we focus on theories where non-locality arises from evolution in the laws of physics in terms of spatially global time variables dual to the constants of Nature. Since non-local theories are foliation-dependent, the {\it local} (but not the global) Hamiltonian constraint is lost. This is true not only while non-locality is taking place, but also after it ceases: the local Hamiltonian constraint is only recovered up to a constant in time, keeping a memory of the integrated past non-locality. We show that this integration constant is equivalent to preserving the local Hamiltonian constraint and adding an extra fluid with the same cosmological properties as conventional pressureless dark matter. The equivalence breaks down in terms of clustering properties, with the new component attracting other matter, but not budging from its location. This is the ultimate ``painted-on'' dark matter, attracting but not being attracted, and nailing down a preferred frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>
