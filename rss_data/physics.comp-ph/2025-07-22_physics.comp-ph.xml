      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Scattering Kernel Derivation Using Molecular Dynamics Data in Very Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free molecular flow regime in VLEO makes gas-surface interactions (GSIs) crucial for satellite aerodynamic modeling. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is required to estimate aerodynamic forces due to the breakdown of the continuum assumption. In DSMC, the Maxwell model is the most widely used approach for GSI. It simplifies the process by treating it as a superposition of diffuse and specular reflections while assuming a constant accommodation coefficient. In reality, this coefficient is influenced by multiple factors, such as the angle and magnitude of the incident velocity. A high-precision GSI model could significantly improve satellite aerodynamics optimization and the design of efficient intakes for atmospheric breathing propulsion systems. This advancement would greatly refine mission planning and fuel requirement calculations, ultimately extending operational lifetimes and lowering costs. To gain a deep understanding of the GSI at the microscopic level, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes involved. However, due to computational limitations, simulating an entire satellite is impractical. Instead, we use MD to analyze the impact of selected velocity vectors on a amorphous $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ surface. The obtained scattering kernels for the respective velocity vectors are then used to train a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). This model is able to generate scattering kernels for any incident velocity vector and can be integrated into DSMC simulations, significantly enhancing their accuracy. Applications of this model on a flat plate have shown that the cVAE is able to predict the shift from diffuse to quasi-specular reflection with increasing polar angle. Additionally, the aerodynamic coefficients and molecular fluxes are considerably different from those obtained with the Maxwell model.</description>

      <title>MENO: Hybrid Matrix Exponential-based Neural Operator for Stiff ODEs. Application to Thermochemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MENO (''Matrix Exponential-based Neural Operator''), a hybrid surrogate modeling framework for efficiently solving stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that exhibit a sparse nonlinear structure. In such systems, only a few variables contribute nonlinearly to the dynamics, while the majority influence the equations linearly. MENO exploits this property by decomposing the system into two components: the low-dimensional nonlinear part is modeled using conventional neural operators, while the linear time-varying subsystem is integrated using a novel neural matrix exponential formulation. This approach combines the exact solution of linear time-invariant systems with learnable, time-dependent graph-based corrections applied to the linear operators. Unlike black-box or soft-constrained physics-informed (PI) models, MENO embeds the governing equations directly into its architecture, ensuring physical consistency (e.g., steady states), improved robustness, and more efficient training. We validate MENO on three complex thermochemical systems: the POLLU atmospheric chemistry model, an oxygen mixture in thermochemical nonequilibrium, and a collisional-radiative argon plasma in one- and two-dimensional shock-tube simulations. MENO achieves relative errors below 2% in trained zero-dimensional settings and maintains good accuracy in extrapolatory multidimensional regimes. It also delivers substantial computational speedups, achieving up to 4 800$\times$ on GPU and 185$\times$ on CPU compared to standard implicit ODE solvers. Although intrusive by design, MENO's physics-based architecture enables superior generalization and reliability, offering a scalable path for real-time simulation of stiff reactive systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Accelerated Large-scale Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method that efficiently solves TO problems and provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum computing to exploit potential quantum advantages. This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for three-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in prior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW) decomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost associated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local and global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical implementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO methods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic consensus transitions in bounded-confidence dynamics on unbiased networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hegselmann-Krause model of opinion dynamics on sparse, unbiased networks generated via Wilson's algorithm, unveiling how network connectivity and confidence bounds jointly determine collective behavior. By systematically exploring the parameter space spanned by the confidence level $\epsilon$ and the mean degree density $\mu$, we construct comprehensive phase diagrams that classify the emergent steady states into different degrees of fragmentation and consensus. We uncover a nonmonotonic re-entrant transition where increased connectivity can paradoxically suppress consensus, and show that full unanimity is unattainable at low connectivity due to structural isolation. Convergence times exhibit two distinct slowdowns: a finite-size, connectivity-dependent resonance near $\epsilon \sim 1/N$, and a critical peak associated with the established fragmentation-to-consensus transition. While the critical confidence threshold $\epsilon_c$ stabilizes near 0.2 for large system sizes, finite-size effects and sparse connectivity significantly alter the dynamics and phase boundaries in smaller populations. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between network topology and opinion dynamics, and highlight conditions under which increased connectivity may hinder, rather than promote, consensus.</description>

      <title>A universal augmentation framework for long-range electrostatics in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on short-range approximations, without explicit treatment of long-range electrostatics. To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization, and Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force training data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with any short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as MACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct systems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on defective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct electrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large and chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing molecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic systems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its short-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts dipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids. By enabling efficient long-range electrostatics without directly training on electrical properties, LES paves the way for electrostatic foundation MLIPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However, time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.</description>

      <title>Designing Two-Dimensional Octuple-Atomic-Layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ as Promising Photocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geant4's Electromagnetic Physics Constructors on Accuracy and Performance of Simulations for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g. the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to model the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of models: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_\mathrm{4}$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The WALOPControl software is designed to facilitate comprehensive control and operation of the WALOP (Wide Area Linear Optical Polarimeter) polarimeters, ensuring safe and concurrent management of various instrument components and functionalities. This software encompasses several critical requirements, including control of the filter wheel, calibration half-wave plate, calibration polarizer, guider positioning, focusers, and 4 concurrent CCD cameras. It also manages the host telescope and dome operations while logging operational parameters, user commands, and environmental conditions for troubleshooting and stability. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface, secure access control, a notification system for errors, and a modular configuration for troubleshooting are integral to the software's architecture. It is accessible over the internet with the backend developed using NodeJS and ExpressJS, featuring a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database, facilitating real-time status updates and data logging. The frontend utilizes the React.JS framework, with Redux for state management and Material UI for the graphical components. The system also allows for automatic observations based on user-defined schedules. A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI CD) pipeline ensures the software's reliability through automated testing and streamlined deployment. The WALOPControl software is a key component of the PASIPHAE (Polar-Areas Stellar Imaging in Polarimetry High Accuracy Experiment) project, which aims to study the dust and magnetic field of the Milky Way by observing the polarization of starlight.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited-state energies with analytic errors and short time evolution on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function, avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems. By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph modelling of wave scattering to speed-up material design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for understanding complex systems, covering group interactions of different orders beyond traditional pairwise interactions. This modelling allows for the simplified description of simultaneous interactions among multiple elements in coupled oscillators, graph neural networks, and entangled qubits. Here, we employ this generalized framework to describe wave-matter interactions for material design acceleration. By devising the set operations for multiparticle systems, we develop the hypergraph model, which compactly describes wave interferences among multiparticles in scattering events by hyperedges of different orders. This compactness enables an evolutionary algorithm with O(N1/2) time complexity and approximated accuracy for designing stealthy hyperuniform materials, which is superior to traditional methods of O(N) scaling. By hybridizing our hypergraph evolutions to the conventional collective-coordinate method, we preserve the original accuracy, while achieving substantial speed-up in approaching near the optimum. Our result paves the way toward scalable material design and compact interpretations of large-scale multiparticle systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux Model for Transport Current Homogenization in Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux (ROHF) model to describe the relationship between time-varying transport current and internal magnetic flux for composite superconductors. The ROHF model is parametrized using reference simulations of the conductor response, after which it enables the computation of macroscopic quantities such as voltage and power loss without requiring detailed electromagnetic field solutions. It is therefore suitable for the homogenization of transport current effects in large-scale superconducting magnets, avoiding a fine discretization of the composite strand small scale structures, allowing to drastically reduce the computational effort. The approximation can be implemented either (i) as a rate-independent model, neglecting eddy current effects in the normal conducting matrix, or (ii) as a rate-dependent model, including those eddy current effects. In this paper, the complete modeling workflow, including parameter identification, coupling with the other fields (temperature and magnetic field), and post-processing of the results, is described and verified using a twisted multifilamentary strand as an example.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>An explainable operator approximation framework under the guideline of Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method and finite volume method, adress partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing them into algebraic equations and solving these iteratively. However, this process is often computationally expensive and time-consuming. An alternative approach involves transforming PDEs into integral equations and solving them using Green's functions, which provide analytical solutions. Nevertheless, deriving Green's functions analytically is a challenging and non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, termed GreensONet, which is constructed based on the strucutre of deep operator networks (DeepONet) to learn embedded Green's functions and solve PDEs via Green's integral formulation. Specifically, the Trunk Net within GreensONet is designed to approximate the unknown Green's functions of the system, while the Branch Net are utilized to approximate the auxiliary gradients of the Green's function. These outputs are subsequently employed to perform surface integrals and volume integrals, incorporating user-defined boundary conditions and source terms, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three types of PDEs in bounded domains: 3D heat conduction equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Stokes equations. Comparative results in these cases demonstrate that GreenONet's accuracy and generalization ability surpass those of existing methods, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), DeepONet, Physics-Informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO).</description>

      <title>Carbon removal capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal forest edge offers considerable potential for climate change mitigation through large-scale tree planting. Afforestation in these sparsely forested regions could assist the natural northward migration of forests while capitalizing on their carbon removal capacity. However, the sequestration potential is uncertain due to a lack of spatially explicit models. This study uses Monte Carlo estimates and a carbon budget model to quantify the carbon removal capacity of afforestation at the northwestern boreal edge from 2025 to 2100. We combined satellite inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate total ecosystem carbon under scenarios considering fire return intervals, land classes, planting mortality, and climate variables. Our results indicate that afforesting ~6.4-32 million hectares could sequester ~3.88-19.4 Gigatonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years, with the Taiga Shield West ecozone showing the most potential. Even the conservative estimate (3.88 Gt$CO_{2}$e) is over five times Canada's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, making it a substantial contribution toward the nation's 2050 net-zero goal. Further research is needed to refine these estimates, assess economic viability, and investigate impacts on regional processes like permafrost thaw and surface albedo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io, and the Computer Physics Communications Library. The new version of the code is designed to perform a ground state search for crystal structures with variable compositions by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Herein, we describe the newly implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in the latest version of the code.</description>

      <title>Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer: Current State and Suggestions for Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver for incompressible viscous flow around dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic, ie. it supports serial and multithreaded CPU execution, and GPUs of different vendors. Additionally, the pure-Julia implementation allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational cost per time step and grid point remains constant with increasing grid size on CPU backends, and we measure up to two orders of magnitude speed-up on a supercomputer GPU compared to serial CPU execution. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>

      <title>Global structure searches under varying temperatures and pressures using polynomial machine learning potentials: A case study on silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 12 to 165x faster than r$^2$SCAN10</description>
