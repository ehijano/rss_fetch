      <title>Glass Transition in Monolayers of Rough Colloidal Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-dynamics correlation is one of the major ongoing debates in the glass transition, although a number of structural features have been found connected to the dynamic heterogeneity in different glass-forming colloidal systems. Here using colloidal experiments combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the glass transition in monolayers of rough colloidal ellipsoids. Compared with smooth colloidal ellipsoids, the surface roughness of ellipsoids is found to significantly change the nature of glass transition. In particular, we find that the surface roughness induced by coating only a few small hemispheres on the ellipsoids can eliminate the existence of orientational glass and the two-step glass transition found in monolayers of smooth ellipsoids. This is due to the surface roughness-induced coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom in colloidal ellipsoids, which also destroys the structure-dynamic correlation found in glass-forming suspensions of colloidal ellipsoids. Our results not only suggest a new way of using surface roughness to manipulate the glass transition in colloidal systems, but also highlight the importance of detailed particle shape on the glass transition and structure-dynamics correlation in suspensions of anisotropic colloids.</description>

      <title>Using recurrent neural networks to predict aspects of 3-D structure of folded copolymer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural network techniques are developed for artificial sequences based on approximate models of proteins. We only encode the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains without attempting to model the secondary structure. We use our approach to obtain a large set of sequences with known 3-D structures for training the neural network. By employing recurrent neural networks we describe a way to augment a neural network to deal with sequences of realistic length and long-distant interactions between the sequence regions.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of adhesion strength in viscoelastic unsteady contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general energy approach to study the unsteady adhesive contact of viscoelastic materials. Under the assumption of infinitely short-range adhesive interactions, we exploit the principle of virtual work to generalize Griffith's local energy balance at contact edges to the case of a non-conservative (viscoelastic) material, subjected to a generic contact time-history. We apply the proposed energy balance criterion to study the approach-retraction motion of a rigid sphere in contact with a viscoelastic half-space. A strong interplay between adhesion and viscoelastic hysteretic losses is reported as the adhesion strength can strongly increase, depending on the loading history. Two diffrent mechanisms govern the pull-off force increase during either approachretraction cycles and approach - full relaxation - retraction tests. In the former case, hysteretic losses occurring close to the circular perimeter of the contact play the major role, significantly enhancing the energy release rate required change the contact size. In the latter case, instead, the pull-off enhancement depends on the glassy response of the whole material which, triggered by the fast retraction after relaxation, leads to a sort of `frozen' state and at-punch-like detachment mechanism (i.e., constant contact area). In this case, the JKR theory of adhesive contact cannot be invoked to relate the observed pull-off force to the effective adhesion energy, i.e. the energy release rate G, and strongly overestimates it. Therefore, a rigorous mathematical procedure is also proposed to correctly calculate the energy release rate in viscoelastic dissipative contacts.</description>

      <title>Unzipping of knotted DNA via nanopore translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA unzipping by nanopore translocation has implications in diverse contexts, from polymer physics to single-molecule manipulation to DNA-enzyme interactions in biological systems. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model of DNA to address the nanopore unzipping of DNA filaments that are knotted. This previously unaddressed problem is motivated by the fact that DNA knots inevitably occur in isolated equilibrated filaments and in vivo. We study how different types of tight knots in the DNA segment just outside the pore impact unzipping at different driving forces. We establish three main results. First, knots do not significantly affect the unzipping process at low forces. However, knotted DNAs unzip more slowly and heterogeneously than unknotted ones at high forces. Finally, we observe that the microscopic origin of the hindrance typically involves two concurrent causes: the topological friction of the DNA chain sliding along its knotted contour and the additional friction originating from the entanglement with the newly unzipped DNA. The results reveal a previously unsuspected complexity of the interplay of DNA topology and unzipping, which should be relevant for interpreting nanopore-based single-molecule unzipping experiments and improving the modeling of DNA transactions in vivo.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic magnetic microgyroscopes with activity-tunable precessional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nano/microrotors are passive elements that spin around an axis due to an external rotating field while remaining confined to a close plane. They have been used to date in different applications related to fluid mixing, drug delivery or biomedicine. Here we realize an active version of a magnetic microgyroscope which is simultaneously driven by a photo-activated catalytic reaction and a rotating magnetic field. We investigate the uplift dynamics of this colloidal spinner when it stands up and precesses around its long axis while self-propelling due to the light induced decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in water. By combining experiments with theory, we show that activity emerging from the cooperative action of phoretic and osmotic forces effectively increase the gravitational torque which counteracts the magnetic and viscous ones, and carefully measure its contribution.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resolution Force Probe Simulations: Coarse Graining in the Ideal Gas Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unfolding of molecular complexes or biomolecules under the influence of external mechanical forces can routinely be simulated with atomistic resolution. To obtain a match of the characteristic time scales with those of experimental force spectroscopy, often coarse graining procedures are employed. Here, building on a previous study, we apply the adaptice resolution scheme (AdResS) to force probe molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations using two model systems as examples. One system is the previously investigated calix[4]arene dimer that shows reversible one-step unfolding and the other example is provided by a small peptide, a $\beta$-alanine octamer in methanol solvent. The mechanical unfolding of this peptide proceeds via a metastable intermediate and therefore represents a first step towards a complex unfolding pathway. In addition to increasing the complexity of the relevant conformational changes we study the impact of the methodology used for coarse graining. Apart from a standard technique, the iterative Boltzmann inversion method, we apply an ideal gas approximation and therefore we replace the solvent by a non-interacting system of spherical particles. In all cases we find excellent agreement between the results of FPMD simulations performed fully atomistically and the AdResS simulations also in the case of fast pulling. This holds for all details of the unfolding pathways like the distributions of the characteristic forces and also the sequence of hydrogen-bond opening in case of the $\beta$-alanine octamer. Therefore, the methodology is very well suited to simulate the mechanical unfolding of systems of experimental relevance also in the presence of protic solvents.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of ionic reorganization near biological membrane interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical signals in excitable cells involve spatially localized ionic fluxes through ion channels and pumps on cellular lipid membranes. Common approaches to understand how these localized fluxes spread assume that the membrane and the surrounding electrolyte comprise an equivalent circuit of capacitors and resistors, which ignores the localized nature of transmembrane ion transport, the resulting ionic gradients and electric fields, and their spatiotemporal relaxation. Here, we consider a model of localized ion pumping across a lipid membrane, and use theory and simulation to investigate how the electrochemical signal propagates spatiotemporally in- and out-of-plane along the membrane. The localized pumping generates long-ranged electric fields with three distinct scaling regimes along the membrane: a constant potential near-field region, an intermediate "monopolar" region, and a far-field "dipolar" region. Upon sustained pumping, the monopolar region expands radially in-plane with a steady speed that is enhanced by the dielectric mismatch and the finite thickness of the lipid membrane. For unmyelinated lipid membranes in physiological settings, we find remarkably fast propagation speeds of $\sim\!40 \, \mathrm{m/s}$, allowing faster ionic reorganization compared to bare diffusion. Together, our work shows that transmembrane ionic fluxes induce transient long-ranged electric fields in electrolyte solutions, which may play hitherto unappreciated roles in biological signaling.</description>

      <title>Harnessing an elastic flow instability to improve the kinetic performance of chromatographic columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research and development, the optimal efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns is still hindered by inherent long-range flow heterogeneity from the wall to the central bulk region of these columns. Here, we show an example of how this issue can be addressed through the straightforward addition of a semidilute amount (500~ppm) of a large, flexible, synthetic polymer (18~MDa partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, HPAM) to the mobile phase (1\% NaCl aqueous solution) during operation of a 4.6 mm $\times$ 300 mm column packed with 10~$\mu$m BEH$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ 125~\AA \ Particles. Addition of the polymer imparts elasticity to the mobile phase, causing the flow in the interparticle pore space to become unstable above a threshold flow rate. We verify the development of this elastic flow instability using pressure drop measurements of the friction factor versus Reynolds number. In prior work, we showed that this flow instability is characterized by large spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pore-scale flow velocities that may promote analyte dispersion across the column. Axial dispersion measurements of the quasi non-retained tracer thiourea confirm this possibility: they unequivocally reveal that operating above the onset of the instability improves column efficiency by significantly reducing peak asymmetry. These experiments thereby provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that elastic flow instabilities can be harnessed to mitigate the negative impact of trans-column flow heterogeneities on the efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns. While this approach has its own inherent limitations and constraints, our work lays the groundwork for future targeted development of polymers that can impart elasticity when dissolved in commonly used liquid chromatography mobile phases, and can thereby generate elastic flow instabilities to help improve the resolution of HPLC columns.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven self-assembly of emerin nanodomains at the nuclear envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerin, a nuclear membrane protein with important biological roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear shape adaptation, self-assembles into nanometer-size domains at the inner nuclear membrane. The size and emerin occupancy of these nanodomains change with applied mechanical stress as well as under emerin mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Through a combination of theory and experiment we show here that a simple reaction-diffusion model explains the self-assembly of emerin nanodomains. Our model yields quantitative agreement with experimental observations on the size and occupancy of emerin nanodomains for wild-type emerin and EDMD-associated mutations of emerin, with and without applied forces, and allows successful prediction of emerin diffusion coefficients from observations on the overall properties of emerin nanodomains. Our results provide a physical understanding of EDMD-associated defects in emerin organization in terms of changes in key reaction and diffusion properties of emerin and its nuclear binding partners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way that cells can tune rigidity using "adaptive degrees of freedom." We study rigidity in vertex models, using the elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as sets of adaptive degrees of freedom that can be introduced to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can tune properties at the cell-scale to obtain desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When wet soil becomes fully saturated by intense rainfall, or is shaken by an earthquake, it may fluidize catastrophically. Sand-rich slurries are treated as granular suspensions, where the failure is related to an unjamming transition. Mud flows are modeled as gels, where yielding and shear-thinning behaviors arise from inter-particle attraction and clustering. Here we show that the full range of complex flow behaviors previously reported for natural debris flows can be reproduced with three ingredients: water, silica sand, and kaolin clay. Going from sand-rich to clay-rich suspensions, we observe continuous transition from brittle to ductile yielding. We propose a general constitutive relation for soil suspensions, with a particle rearrangement time that is controlled by yield stress and jamming distance. Our experimental results are supported by models for amorphous solids, suggesting that the paradigm of non-equilibrium phase transitions can help us understand and predict the complex behaviors of Soft Earth suspensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring pNIPAM Lyogels: Experimental Study on Swelling Equilibria in Various Organic Solvents and Mixtures, Supported by COSMO-RS Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive lyogels are considered to be smart materials due to their capability of undergoing significant macroscopic changes in response to external triggers. Due to their versatile and unique properties, smart lyogels exhibit great potential in various applications such as drug delivery or actuation processes. While Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) is widely known as a thermo-responsive material, it also shows significant solvent-responsive swelling behavior. As polar solvents induce strong swelling due to hydrogen bonding with the amide group, nonpolar solvents lead to significant shrinkage of the lyogels. The aim of this study is to investigate and to model this behavior for future application in chemical or biochemical reactors. As a current area of research, incorporating smart hydrogel technology into (bio-)chemical reactors facilitates the development of smart reactor systems. Applying thermodynamic modelling with the gE model COSMO-RS on the monomer or oligomers of pNIPAM, the correlation between solvent-polymer interactions and the degree of swelling can be observed. pNIPAM derivatives exhibit low infinitive dilution activity coefficients (IDACs) in polar solvents with large degrees of swelling, while displaying an increase of IDACs in nonpolar solvents. Hydrogen bonds dominate the swelling behavior of lyogels not only in pure solvents but also in mixtures of solvents with varying polarity. Even in mixtures containing high amounts of nonpolar solvents, large degrees of swelling were observed due to the uptake of the polar solvent in the lyogel matrix. This effect can be observed in binary solvent mixtures but also in representative mixtures along an esterification reaction with varying carboxylic chain length of alcohol and carboxylic acids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an effective Rouse model for tangentially active polymers, characterized by a constant active force tangent to their backbone. In particular, we show that, once extended to account for finite bending rigidity, such active Rouse model captures the reduction in the gyration radius, or coil-to-globule-like transition, that has been observed numerically in the literature for such active filaments. Interestingly, our analysis identifies the proper definition of the Peclet number, that allows to collapse all numerical data onto a master curve.</description>

      <title>Effective Single Particle Theory for Active Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a collection of active agents and present an effective single-particle theory to describe the dynamical behaviour of the system in the steady state. Unlike their equilibrium counterparts, active particles display phase separation at much lower packing densities, marked by continuous formation and dissolution of clusters. To model such behavior, we replace the effect of many-particle interactions by a time-dependent local density. Further we propose a unique auto-correlation of the local density with a characteristic correlation time. The correlation time monotonically increases with packing density and unveils a transition at a critical density. In experimental setups, this correlation time is easily quantifiable by monitoring changes in density around a tagged particle. By utilizing this local density and its correlation, we calculate the effective diffusivity of the particles. Finally, we compare the results of the effective single particle theory with numerical simulations and find good agreement between them across a range of packing densities.</description>
