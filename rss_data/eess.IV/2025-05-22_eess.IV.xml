      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Techniques, Algorithms, Advancements, Challenges, and Clinical Applications of Multi-modal Medical Image Fusion for Improved Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal medical image fusion (MMIF) is increasingly recognized as an essential technique for enhancing diagnostic precision and facilitating effective clinical decision-making within computer-aided diagnosis systems. MMIF combines data from X-ray, MRI, CT, PET, SPECT, and ultrasound to create detailed, clinically useful images of patient anatomy and pathology. These integrated representations significantly advance diagnostic accuracy, lesion detection, and segmentation. This comprehensive review meticulously surveys the evolution, methodologies, algorithms, current advancements, and clinical applications of MMIF. We present a critical comparative analysis of traditional fusion approaches, including pixel-, feature-, and decision-level methods, and delves into recent advancements driven by deep learning, generative models, and transformer-based architectures. A critical comparative analysis is presented between these conventional methods and contemporary techniques, highlighting differences in robustness, computational efficiency, and interpretability. The article addresses extensive clinical applications across oncology, neurology, and cardiology, demonstrating MMIF's vital role in precision medicine through improved patient-specific therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the review thoroughly investigates the persistent challenges affecting MMIF's broad adoption, including issues related to data privacy, heterogeneity, computational complexity, interpretability of AI-driven algorithms, and integration within clinical workflows. It also identifies significant future research avenues, such as the integration of explainable AI, adoption of privacy-preserving federated learning frameworks, development of real-time fusion systems, and standardization efforts for regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Classical Pipeline for X Ray Based Fracture Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone fractures are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Traditional X ray interpretation is time consuming and error prone, while existing machine learning and deep learning solutions often demand extensive feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and high computational resources. To address these challenges, a distributed hybrid quantum classical pipeline is proposed that first applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then leverages a 4 qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. By fusing eight PCA derived features with eight quantum enhanced features into a 16 dimensional vector and then classifying with different machine learning models achieving 99% accuracy using a public multi region X ray dataset on par with state of the art transfer learning models while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.</description>

      <title>Aneumo: A Large-Scale Multimodal Aneurysm Dataset with Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations and Deep Learning Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive, hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications. To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized 10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input. Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Xigui-Li/Aneumo.</description>

      <title>MedBLIP: Fine-tuning BLIP for Medical Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.</description>

      <title>LOD1 3D City Model from LiDAR: The Impact of Segmentation Accuracy on Quality of Urban 3D Modeling and Morphology Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method, utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.</description>

      <title>TransMedSeg: A Transferable Semantic Framework for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module, which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable representation learning in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Virtual Fluoroscopy for Interventional Guidance using Magnetic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In conventional fluoroscopy-guided interventions, the 2D projective nature of X-ray imaging limits depth perception and leads to prolonged radiation exposure. Virtual fluoroscopy, combined with spatially tracked surgical instruments, is a promising strategy to mitigate these limitations. While magnetic tracking shows unique advantages, particularly in tracking flexible instruments, it remains under-explored due to interference from ferromagnetic materials in the C-arm room. This work proposes a virtual fluoroscopy workflow by effectively integrating magnetic tracking, and demonstrates its clinical efficacy. Methods: An automatic virtual fluoroscopy workflow was developed using a radiolucent tabletop field generator prototype. Specifically, we developed a fluoro-CT registration approach with automatic 2D-3D shared landmark correspondence to establish the C-arm-patient relationship, along with a general C-arm modelling approach to calculate desired poses and generate corresponding virtual fluoroscopic images. Results: Testing on a dataset with views ranging from RAO 90 degrees to LAO 90 degrees, simulated fluoroscopic images showed visually imperceptible differences from the real ones, achieving a mean target projection distance error of 1.55 mm. An endoleak phantom insertion experiment highlighted the effectiveness of simulating multiplanar views with real-time instrument overlays, achieving a mean needle tip error of 3.42 mm. Conclusions: Results demonstrated the efficacy of virtual fluoroscopy integrated with magnetic tracking, improving depth perception during navigation. The broad capture range of virtual fluoroscopy showed promise in improving the users understanding of X-ray imaging principles, facilitating more efficient image acquisition.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography Using Diffusion Model-Based Plug-and-Play Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an OCT super-resolution framework based on a plug-and-play diffusion model (PnP-DM) to reconstruct high-quality images from sparse measurements (OCT B-mode corneal images). Our method formulates reconstruction as an inverse problem, combining a diffusion prior with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for efficient posterior inference. We collect high-speed under-sampled B-mode corneal images and apply a deep learning-based up-sampling pipeline to build realistic training pairs. Evaluations on in vivo and ex vivo fish-eye corneal models show that PnP-DM outperforms conventional 2D-UNet baselines, producing sharper structures and better noise suppression. This approach advances high-fidelity OCT imaging in high-speed acquisition for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Rate-Accuracy Bounds in Visual Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly, visual signals such as images, videos and point clouds are being captured solely for the purpose of automated analysis by computer vision models. Applications include traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous driving, smart home, and many others. This trend has led to the need to develop compression strategies for these signals for the purpose of analysis rather than reconstruction, an area often referred to as "coding for machines." By drawing parallels with lossy coding of a discrete memoryless source, in this paper we derive rate-accuracy bounds on several popular problems in visual coding for machines, and compare these with state-of-the-art results from the literature. The comparison shows that the current results are at least an order of magnitude -- and in some cases two or three orders of magnitude -- away from the theoretical bounds in terms of the bitrate needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy. This, in turn, means that there is much room for improvement in the current methods for visual coding for machines.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Optimization with Non-Reference Metrics for UGC Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service providers must encode a large volume of noisy videos to meet the demand for user-generated content (UGC) in online video-sharing platforms. However, low-quality UGC challenges conventional codecs based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO) with full-reference metrics (FRMs). While effective for pristine videos, FRMs drive codecs to preserve artifacts when the input is degraded, resulting in suboptimal compression. A more suitable approach used to assess UGC quality is based on non-reference metrics (NRMs). However, RDO with NRMs as a measure of distortion requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding, and metric evaluation, which is computationally impractical. This paper overcomes this limitation by linearizing the NRM around the uncompressed video. The resulting cost function enables block-wise bit allocation in the transform domain by estimating the alignment of the quantization error with the gradient of the NRM. To avoid large deviations from the input, we add sum of squared errors (SSE) regularization. We derive expressions for both the SSE regularization parameter and the Lagrangian, akin to the relationship used for SSE-RDO. Experiments with images and videos show bitrate savings of more than 30\% over SSE-RDO using the target NRM, with no decoder complexity overhead and minimal encoder complexity increase.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Motion Correction for MRI Reconstruction via Coarse-To-Fine Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging. We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency components are sampled during each motion state.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Primary and Secondary Transforms Using Rate-Distortion Optimized Transform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-dependent transforms are increasingly being incorporated into next-generation video coding systems such as AVM, a codec under development by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), and VVC. To circumvent the computational complexities associated with implementing non-separable data-dependent transforms, combinations of separable primary transforms and non-separable secondary transforms have been studied and integrated into video coding standards. These codecs often utilize rate-distortion optimized transforms (RDOT) to ensure that the new transforms complement existing transforms like the DCT and the ADST. In this work, we propose an optimization framework for jointly designing primary and secondary transforms from data through a rate-distortion optimized clustering. Primary transforms are assumed to follow a path-graph model, while secondary transforms are non-separable. We empirically evaluate our proposed approach using AVM residual data and demonstrate that 1) the joint clustering method achieves lower total RD cost in the RDOT design framework, and 2) jointly optimized separable path-graph transforms (SPGT) provide better coding efficiency compared to separable KLTs obtained from the same data.</description>

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

      <title>Physics-Guided Multi-View Graph Neural Network for Schizophrenia Classification via Structural-Functional Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>SAMA-UNet: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation with Self-Adaptive Mamba-Like Attention and Causal-Resonance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>X-GRM: Large Gaussian Reconstruction Model for Sparse-view X-rays to Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows, providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures. Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model architecture, inflexible volume representation, and small-scale training data. In this paper, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT from sparse-view 2D X-ray projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode an arbitrary number of sparse X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views are integrated efficiently. Then, tokens are decoded into a new volume representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. To support the training of X-GRM, we collect ReconX-15K, a large-scale CT reconstruction dataset containing around 15,000 CT/X-ray pairs across diverse organs, including the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and tooth etc. This combination of a high-capacity model, flexible volume representation, and large-scale training data empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various testing inputs, including in-domain and out-domain X-ray projections.

      <title>Reconsider the Template Mesh in Deep Learning-based Mesh Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications, including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation. Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical structures.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Plug-and-Play Algorithms with Kernel Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of denoisers for image reconstruction has shown significant potential, especially for the Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework. In PnP, a powerful denoiser is used as an implicit regularizer in proximal algorithms such as ISTA and ADMM. The focus of this work is on the convergence of PnP iterates for linear inverse problems using kernel denoisers. It was shown in prior work that the update operator in standard PnP is contractive for symmetric kernel denoisers under appropriate conditions on the denoiser and the linear forward operator. Consequently, we could establish global linear convergence of the iterates using the contraction mapping theorem. In this work, we develop a unified framework to establish global linear convergence for symmetric and nonsymmetric kernel denoisers. Additionally, we derive quantitative bounds on the contraction factor (convergence rate) for inpainting, deblurring, and superresolution. We present numerical results to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Derived Blood Input for Dynamic PET Images of Rat Heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function (IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2 representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer in women globally, requires early detection through Pap smear tests to identify precancerous changes and prevent disease progression. In this study, we performed a focused analysis by segmenting the cellular boundaries and drawing bounding boxes to isolate the cancer cells. A novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture, the ``Multi-Resolution Fusion Deep Convolutional Network", was proposed to effectively handle images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, with its efficacy showcased using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The performance of this DL model was observed to be similar to the state-of-the-art models, with accuracy variations of a mere 2\% to 3\%, achieved using just 1.7 million learnable parameters, which is approximately 85 times less than the VGG-19 model. Furthermore, we introduced a multi-task learning technique that simultaneously performs segmentation and classification tasks and begets an Intersection over Union score of 0.83 and a classification accuracy of 90\%. The final stage of the workflow employs a probabilistic approach for risk assessment, extracting feature vectors to predict the likelihood of normal cells progressing to malignant states, which can be utilized for the prognosis of cervical cancer.</description>

      <title>Combining Progressive Image Compression and Random Access in DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in storage demand and low lifespan of data storage devices has resulted in long-term archival and preservation emerging as a critical bottlenecks in data storage. In order to meet this demand, researchers are now investigating novel forms of data storage media. The high density, long lifespan and low energy needs of synthetic DNA make it a promising candidate for long-term data archival. However, current DNA data storage technologies are facing challenges with respect to cost (writing data to DNA is expensive) and reliability (reading and writing data is error prone). Thus, data compression and error correction are crucial to scale DNA storage. Additionally, the DNA molecules encoding several files are very often stored in the same place, called an oligo pool. For this reason, without random access solutions, it is relatively impractical to decode a specific file from the pool, because all the oligos from all the files need to first be sequenced, which greatly deteriorates the read cost. This paper introduces PIC-DNA - a novel JPEG2000-based progressive image coder adapted to DNA data storage. This coder directly includes a random access process in its coding system, allowing for the retrieval of a specific image from a pool of oligos encoding several images. The progressive decoder can dynamically adapt the read cost according to the user's cost and quality constraints at decoding time. Both the random access and progressive decoding greatly improve on the read-cost of image coders adapted to DNA.</description>

      <title>Predicting Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Using Pre-Treatment Histopathologic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR. Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score: 0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.</description>

      <title>FRN: Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral reconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this paper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network (FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate the full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot manner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process, predicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach for predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN establishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an atomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information from neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image at the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data. Moreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a pixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation process, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused by reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different datasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Medical Image Representations via Quaternion Wavelet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10224v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of methodological standards causes large variations being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic framework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed quaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their adoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands through the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data samples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different datasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction, segmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination with both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves network performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios and robust to domain shifts.

Abstract: Learned wavelet video coders provide an explainable framework by performing discrete wavelet transforms in temporal, horizontal, and vertical dimensions. With a temporal transform based on motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF), spatial and temporal scalability is obtained. In this paper, we introduce variable rate support and a mechanism for quality adaption to different temporal layers for a higher coding efficiency. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that allows training with multiple temporal layers. Our experiments demonstrate Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta bitrate savings of at least -32% compared to a learned MCTF model without these extensions. Training and inference code is available at: https://github.com/FAU-LMS/Learned-pMCTF.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</description>

      <title>Diff-Unfolding: A Model-Based Score Learning Framework for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are extensively used for modeling image priors for inverse problems. We introduce \emph{Diff-Unfolding}, a principled framework for learning posterior score functions of \emph{conditional diffusion models} by explicitly incorporating the physical measurement operator into a modular network architecture. Diff-Unfolding formulates posterior score learning as the training of an unrolled optimization scheme, where the measurement model is decoupled from the learned image prior. This design allows our method to generalize across inverse problems at inference time by simply replacing the forward operator without retraining. We theoretically justify our unrolling approach by showing that the posterior score can be derived from a composite model-based optimization formulation. Extensive experiments on image restoration and accelerated MRI show that Diff-Unfolding achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving PSNR by up to 2 dB and reducing LPIPS by $22.7\%$, while being both compact (47M parameters) and efficient (0.72 seconds per $256 \times 256$ image). An optimized C++/LibTorch implementation further reduces inference time to 0.63 seconds, underscoring the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via media diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

      <title>A Generative Diffusion Model to Solve Inverse Problems for Robust in-NICU Neonatal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first acquisition-agnostic diffusion generative model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to solve a range of inverse problems for shortening scan time and improving motion robustness. In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>DisCoPatch: Batch Statistics Are All You Need For OOD Detection, But Only If You Can Trust Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code will be made publicly available</description>
