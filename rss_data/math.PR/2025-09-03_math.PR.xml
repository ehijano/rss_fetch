      <title>An Elementary Proof of the Hanson-Wright Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hanson-Wright inequality establishes exponential concentration for quadratic forms $X^T M X$, where $X$ is a vector with independent sub-Gaussian entries and with parameters depending on the Frobenius and operator norms of $M$. The most elementary proof to date is due to Rudelson &amp; Vershinyn, who still rely on a convex decoupling argument due to Bourgain, followed by Gaussian comparison to arrive at the result. In this note we sidestep this decoupling and provide an arguably simpler proof reliant only on elementary properties of sub-Gaussian variables and Gaussian rotational invariance. As a consequence we also obtain improved constants.</description>

      <title>Examples of stable-like random walks on groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several families of long jump random walks on groups of polynomial volume growth which are naturally expected to have a stable-like behavior. We then prove optimal pseudo-Poincar\'e inequalities for these walks. These pseudo-Poincar\'e inequalities allow us to show that the random walks in questions indeed have a stable-like behavior and to obtain detailed estimates.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds and heat kernel upper estimates for Dirichlet forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a Harnack-type inequality on exit times and spectral bounds to characterize upper bounds of the heat kernel associated with any regular Dirichlet form without killing part, where the scale function may vary with position. We further show that this Harnack-type inequality is preserved under quasi-symmetric changes of metric on uniformly perfect metric spaces. This generalised the work of Mariano and Wang [Stochastic Process. Appl. 189 (2025) 104707)].</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Aspects of Weighted Free Poisson Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will be devoted to study weighted (deformed) free Poisson random variables from the viewpoint of orthogonal polynomials and statistics of non-crossing partitions. A family of weighted (deformed) free Poisson random variables will be defined in a sense by the sum of weighted (deformed) free creation, annihilation, scalar, and intermediate operators with certain parameters on a weighted (deformed) free Fock space together with the vacuum expectation. We shall provide a combinatorial moment formula of non-commutative Poisson random variables. This formula gives us a very nice combinatorial interpretation to two parameters of weights. One can see that the deformation treated in this paper interpolates free and boolean Poisson random variables, their distributions and moments, and yields some conditionally free Poisson distribution by taking limit of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate for Fluctuations of mean field interacting diffusion and application to 2D viscous Vortex model and Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a system of mean field interacting diffusion on $\mathbb{T}^d$, the empirical measure $\mu^N$ converges to the solution $\mu$ of the Fokker-Planck equation. Refining this mean field limit as a Central Limit Theorem, the fluctuation process $\rho^N_t= \sqrt{N}( \mu^N_t -\mu_t)$ convergences to the solution $\rho$ of a linear stochastic PDE on the negative Sobolev space $H^{-\lambda-2}(\mathbb{T}^d)$. The main result of the paper is to establish a rate for such convergence: we show that $|\mathbb{E}[\Phi(\rho_t^N)] - \mathbb{E}[\Phi(\rho_t)]| = \mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$, for smooth functions on $H^{-\lambda-2}(\mathbb{T}^d)$. The strategy relies on studying the generators of the processes $\rho^N$ and $\rho$ on $H^{-\lambda-2}(\mathbb{T}^d)$, and thus estimating their difference. Among others, this requires to approximate in probability $\rho$ with solutions to stochastic diffential equations on the Hilbert space $H^{-\lambda-2}(\mathbb{T}^d)$. The flexibility of the approach permits to establish a rate for the fluctuations, not only in case of a regular drift, but also for the the 2D viscous Vortex model, governed by the Biot-Savart kernel, and for the repulsive Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equation for stochastic heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of the Fokker--Planck equation for a stochastic heat equation with an additive $Q$-Wiener noise and non-homogeneous boundary conditions. We explicitly construct the probability density function and establish the associated Fokker--Planck equation by applying the eigenfunction expansion technique. Moreover, the Feynman--Kac formula is used to obtain the probabilistic representation of the solution. The analysis is further extended to cases with multiplicative noise involving nonlocal diffusion operators under homogeneous boundary conditions, as well as the corresponding Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation. Notably, the evolution of the probability density function for the stochastic heat equation depends critically on the spatial location.</description>

      <title>Responsive dormancy of a spatial population among a moving trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a spatial model for dormancy in a random environment via a two-type branching random walk in continuous-time, where individuals switch between dormant and active states depending on the current state of a fluctuating environment (responsive switching). The branching mechanism is governed by the same random environment, which is here taken to be a simple symmetric random walk. We will interpret the presence of this random walk as a trap which attempts to kill the individuals whenever it meets them. The responsive switching between the active and dormant state is defined so that active individuals become dormant only when a trap is present at their location and remain active otherwise. Conversely, dormant individuals can only wake up once the environment becomes trap-free again.
  We quantify the influence of dormancy on population survival by analyzing the long-time asymptotics of the expected population size. The starting point for our mathematical considerations and proofs is the parabolic Anderson model via the Feynman-Kac formula. Specifically, we investigate the quantitative role of dormancy by extending the Parabolic Anderson model to a two-type random walk framework.</description>

      <title>Robust Stochastic Outperformance under Kullback-Leibler Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the worst-case probability that $Y$ outperforms a benchmark $X$ when the law of $Y$ lies in a Kullback-Leibler neighbourhood of the benchmark. The max-min problem over couplings admits a tractable dual (via optimal transport), whose optimiser is an exponential tilt of the benchmark law. The resulting solution reduces to a one-parameter family indexed by regulizer $\lambda$, which controls the KL information budget and induces an increasing transfer of probability mass from lower to higher outcomes. The formulation can be evaluated from the baseline distribution and may serve as a distribution-wide scenario generation environment as well as a basis for robust performance assessment.
  Keywords: exponential tilting; optimal transport; stochastic dominance; stress testing.</description>

      <title>Weak irreducibility of stochastic delay differential equation driven by pure jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the weak irreducibility of stochastic delay differential equations(SDDEs) driven by pure jump noise. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a concise proof of weak irreducibility, releasing condition (A1-3) in Assumption 2.1 from the literature \cite{WYZZ1}. As an application, we derive the weak irreducibility of SDDEs with weakly dissipative coefficients. An important novelty of this paper is to allow the driving noises to be degenerate. This closes the gap of the irreducibility of SDDEs driven by pure jump noise.</description>

      <title>Classification of Discrete-Time Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we classify discrete-time queues based on scheduling rules and observation epochs combinations. This classification leads to {\em coherent}, {\em sub-coherent}, and {\em super-coherent} systems when {\em observed} waiting times are, respectively equal to, less than, or larger than {actual} waiting times. We then explore the consequences of this classification. Specifically, we discuss invariant properties of {\em coherent} systems including queue-lengths, waiting times, servers' busy times, busy periods, Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, and other common characteristics. An important consequence is that a performance characteristic of a system with specific scheduling rule and observation epoch combination extends to the entire class. An unresolved issue in the literature is the assertion that Little's law does not apply for discrete-time queues that incorporate certain scheduling rules. Using this classification, we reconcile the generality of Little's law and its applicability to all discrete-time queues regardless of scheduling rules.</description>

      <title>The Donsker-Varadhan Action Functional for Probabilistic Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of the large deviations theory of occupational measures, the paper considers Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA) as Markov chains on infinite dimensional space. It turns out that for a wide range of PCA, the corresponding Donsker-Varadhan action functional yields values other than infinity only on a narrow class of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Valued Orthogonal Polynomials Related to a Class of Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundational work of Karlin and McGregor established a powerful connection between random walks with tridiagonal transition matrices and the theory of orthogonal polynomials. We consider a particular extension of this framework, where the transition matrix is given by a polynomial in a tridiagonal matrix. This generalization leads to transitions beyond the nearest neighbors. We investigate the matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials associated with these extended models, derive the corresponding matrix-valued measure of orthogonality explicitly, and analyze how spectral properties of the transition matrix relate to probabilistic features of the random walk. As an application, we study generalized Ehrenfest models that incorporates longer-range transitions.</description>

      <title>Relation between Wick powers and excursion clusters of the 2D GFF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decomposition of the Wick powers of the continuum GFF in dimension $2$ via the first passage sets (FPS) and the excursion clusters (sign components) of the GFF. These sets are non-thin for the GFF, that is to say the field has non-trivial restriction to such a set, which is a measure, negative or positive depending on the sign. In this work we show that all the odd Wick powers of the GFF can be restricted to the FPS and the excursion clusters, and the restrictions are generalized functions supported on these fractal sets. By contrast, the restriction of an even Wick power to an FPS or excursion cluster is diverging, and to get something converging an additional compensation is required, which is provided by a smooth function living outside of the set and blowing up in a non-integrable way when approaching the set. We further provide expressions of restricted odd Wick powers and restricted-compensated even Wick powers as limits of functions living outside the FPS/excursion cluster.
  Then, we study the $\varepsilon$-neighborhoods, in the sense of conformal radius, of first passage sets and excursion clusters. We show that such $\varepsilon$-neighborhoods admit asymptotic expansions in $L^2$ into half-integer powers $\vert\log \varepsilon\vert^{-(n+1/2)}$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, of $1/\vert\log \varepsilon\vert$. The coefficients of the expansion involve the restrictions of the odd Wick powers. By contrast, the even Wick powers do not appear in the expansion. Our expansion is reminiscent of Le Gall's expansion for the Wiener sausage in dimension 2, with however some important differences. The most important one is that the powers of $1/\vert\log \varepsilon\vert$ are different. In the case of the Wiener sausage the powers are integer, $\vert\log \varepsilon\vert^{-n}$, $n\in\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the metastable behavior of the long-range Ising model on random regular graphs under Glauber dynamics at low-temperature. We estimate the energy barrier and exit time from the metastable state using a nontrivial path-wise approach that explicitly accounts for the spatial decay of the interactions and the structural properties of the graph, such as the Cheeger constant and known estimates of the diameter. Our results generalize those of Dommers \cite{dommers2017metastability} for the short-range case, providing a unified framework for understanding metastability in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions, which are also termed as McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with jump idiosyncratic noise and jump common noise. As far as conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions are concerned, the corresponding conditional distribution flow is a measure-valued process, which indeed satisfies a stochastic partial integral differential equation driven by a Poisson random measure. Via a novel construction of the asymptotic coupling by reflection, we explore the ergodicity of the underlying measure-valued process corresponding to a one-dimensional conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusion when the associated drift term fulfils a partially dissipative condition with respect to the spatial variable. In addition, the theory derived demonstrates that the intensity of the jump common noise and the jump idiosyncratic noise can simultaneously enhance the convergence rate of the exponential ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay for the random connection model using asymptotic transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the probability the cluster of the origin in a subcritical Poisson random connection model (RCM) has size at least $n$ decays exponentially as $n$ increases, under minimal assumptions.
  We extend a recent method of Vanneuville (arXiv:2304.12110) from Bernoulli percolation on vertex-transitive graphs to the RCM. The key idea is that the subcritical RCM can be constructed by site percolation on a very high-intensity RCM. The latter RCM becomes ``almost vertex-transitive'' in a certain sense at very high intensities, which is a new method that we expect to be useful for other problems.
  We obtain the result for connection functions with unbounded support, a setting in which it was not previously known.</description>

      <title>A recursive formula for the $n^\text{th}$ survival function and the $n^\text{th}$ first passage time distribution for jump and diffusion processes. Applications to the pricing of $n^\text{th}$-to-default CDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive some rather general, but complicated, formulae to compute the survival function and the first passage time distribution of the $n^\text{th}$ coordinate of a many-body stochastic process in the presence of a killing barrier. First we will study the case of two coordinates and then we will generalize the results to three or more coordinates. Even if the results are difficult to implement, we will provide examples of their use applying them to a physical system, the single file diffusion, and to the financial problem of pricing a $n^\text{th}$-to-default credit default swap ($n^\text{th}$-CDS)</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative positivity of transition densities for random perturbations of Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of diffusion processes arising from random perturbations of conservative Hamiltonian systems. Under a set of abstract hypotheses -- including basic structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian, a weak Lyapunov structure, and a quantitative notion of hypoellipticity -- we prove that transition densities satisfy a sharp, uniform pointwise lower bound over Hamiltonian sublevel sets in the small noise limit $\epsilon \to 0$. By applying our general theorem, we obtain quantitative minorization estimates for a variety of models including Langevin dynamics, chains of oscillators coupled to heat bathes at different temperatures, and finite-dimensional fluid models such as stochastically forced Galerkin truncations of the Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz '96 system. As a corollary, assuming a stronger Lyapunov structure, our main result yields a sharp exponential rate of convergence to equilibrium for $0 &lt; \epsilon \ll 1$ in a weighted total variation norm. A central feature of our approach is that it does not require knowledge of the explicit form of the invariant measure, nor even its existence, and hence is broadly applicable to deduce minorization for physically relevant systems where invariant measures are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the stochastic heat equation over large intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear stochastic heat equation on $[0,T]\times [-L,L]$, driven by a space-time white noise $W$, with a given initial condition $u_0: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and three different types of (vanishing) boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Mixed and Neumann. We prove that as $L\to\infty$, the random field solution at any space-time position converges in the $L^p(\Omega)$-norm ($p\ge 1$) to the solution of the stochastic heat equation on $\mathbb{R}$ (with the same initial condition $u_0$), and we determine the (near optimal) rate of convergence. The proof relies on estimates of differences between the corresponding Green's functions on $[-L, L]$ and the heat kernel on $\mathbb{R}$, and on a space-time version of a Gronwall-type lemma.</description>

      <title>Limiting one-point fluctuations of the geodesic in the directed landscape near the endpoints when the geodesic length goes to infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the limiting fluctuations of the geodesic in the directed landscape, conditioning on its length going to infinity. It was shown in \cite{Liu22b,Ganguly-Hegde-Zhang23} that when the directed landscape $\mathcal{L}(0,0;0,1) = L$ becomes large, the geodesic from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$ lies in a strip of size $O(L^{-1/4})$ and behaves like a Brownian bridge if we zoom in the strip by a factor of $L^{1/4}$. Moreover, the length along the geodesic with respect to the directed landscape fluctuates of order $O(L^{1/4})$ and its limiting one-point distribution is Gaussian \cite{Liu22b}. In this paper, we further zoom in a smaller neighborhood of the endpoints when $\mathcal{L}(0,0;0,1) = L$ or $\mathcal{L}(0,0;0,1) \ge L$, and show that there is a critical scaling window $L^{-3/2}:L^{-1}:L^{-1/2}$ for the time, geodesic location, and geodesic length, respectively. Within this scaling window, we find a nontrivial limit of the one-point joint distribution of the geodesic location and length as $L\to\infty$. This limiting distribution, if we tune the time parameter to infinity, converges to the joint distribution of two independent Gaussian random variables, which is consistent with the results in \cite{Liu22b}. We also find a surprising connection between this limiting distribution and the one-point distribution of the upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point recently obtained in \cite{Liu-Zhang25}.</description>

      <title>Random burning of the Euclidean lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burning number of a graph is the minimal number of steps that are needed to burn all of its vertices, with the following burning procedure: at each step, one can choose a point to set on fire, and the fire propagates constantly at unit speed along the edges of the graph. In this paper, we consider two natural random burning procedures in the discrete Euclidean torus $\mathbb{T}_n^d$, in which the points that we set on fire at each step are random variables. Our main result deals with the case where at each step, the law of the new point that we set on fire conditionally on the past is the uniform distribution on the complement of the set of vertices burned by the previous points. In this case, we prove that as $n\to\infty$, the corresponding random burning number (i.e, the first step at which the whole torus is burned) is asymptotic to $T\cdot n^{d/(d+1)}$ in probability, where $T=T(d)\in(0,\infty)$ is the explosion time of a so-called generalised Blasius equation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Donoho-Elad Spark Uncertainty Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donoho and Elad \textit{[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003]} introduced the important notion of the spark of a frame, using which they derived a fundamental uncertainty principle. Based on spark, they also provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of sparse solutions to the NP-hard $\ell_0$-minimization problem. In this nano note, we show that the notion of spark can be extended to linear maps whose domains are measure spaces. Using this generalization, we derive an uncertainty principle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of sparse solutions to linear systems on measure spaces.</description>

      <title>A review of the Markov model of life insurance with a view to surplus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review Markov models of surplus in life insurance based on a counting process following Norberg (1991), uniting probabilistic theory with elements of practice largely drawn from UK experience. First, we organize models systematically based on one and two technical bases, including a suitable descriptive notation. Extending this to three technical bases to accommodate different valuation approaches leads us: (a) to expand the definition of 'technical basis' to include non-contractual cashflows recognized in the associated Thiele equation; and (b) to add new (mainly) systematic terms to the surplus. Making these cashflows dynamic or 'quasi-contractual' covers many real applications, and we give two as examples, the paid-up valuation principle and reversionary bonus on participating contracts.</description>

      <title>WoSNN: Stochastic Solver for PDEs with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental step in various scientific and engineering studies. As a classic stochastic solver, the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method is a well-established and efficient algorithm that provides accurate local estimates for PDEs. In this paper, by integrating machine learning techniques with WoS and space discretization approaches, we develop a novel stochastic solver, WoS-NN. This new method solves elliptic problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, facilitating precise and rapid global solutions and gradient approximations. The method inherits excellent characteristics from the original WoS method, such as being meshless and robust to irregular regions. By integrating neural networks, WoS-NN also gives instant local predictions after training without re-sampling, which is especially suitable for intense requests on a static region. A typical experimental result demonstrates that the proposed WoS-NN method provides accurate field estimations, reducing errors by around $75\%$ while using only $8\%$ of path samples compared to the conventional WoS method, which saves abundant computational time and resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Assessing One-Dimensional Cluster Stability by Extreme-Point Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and geometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their span contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our approach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative reduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive analytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected shrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that these curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct an elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical shrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher classification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in small-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for large n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g. DBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without any density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both theoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and cluster stability analysis.</description>

Abstract: Expectiles are statistical parameters which also provide a class of sublinear risk measures in finance. They are solutions of continuous optimization problems. The corresponding first order condition provides two different fixed point characterizations for expectiles, both of which can be utilized for computing them. Although especially the so-called two-sided version is already implemented and widely used, a general convergence proof appears to be new.</description>

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the adaptive Euler-Maruyama (EM) schemes for the approximation of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with common noise. When the drift and diffusion coefficients both satisfy the superlinear growth conditions, the $L^p$ convergence rates in finite and infinite horizons are revealed, which reacts to the particle number and step size. Subsequently, there is an illustration of the theory results by means of two numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP) with long-range swap, a new interacting particle system combining the backward-push rule with the forward-jump rule. Although governed by local dynamics, the model induces effective long-range particle exchanges. We establish its integrability by proving two-particle reducibility and showing that the associated scattering matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we derive explicit contour integral formulas for transition probabilities. These results position the long-range swap model as a novel exactly solvable multispecies process, characterized by distinctive algebraic features and opening new directions for further study in integrable probability and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the $d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient descent can achieve comparable guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample a target probability distribution, which arises in many applications in machine learning. Inspired by regime-switching stochastic differential equations in the probability literature, we propose and study regime-switching Langevin dynamics (RS-LD) and regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (RS-KLD). Based on their discretizations, we introduce regime-switching Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-LMC) and regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-KLMC) algorithms, which can also be viewed as LMC and KLMC algorithms with random stepsizes. We also propose frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (FRS-KLD) and its associated algorithm frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (FRS-KLMC), which can also be viewed as the KLMC algorithm with random frictional coefficients. We provide their 2-Wasserstein non-asymptotic convergence guarantees to the target distribution, and analyze the iteration complexities. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a derivation of the explicit price for the perpetual American put option in the Black-Scholes model, time-capped by the first drawdown epoch beyond a predefined level. We demonstrate that the optimal exercise strategy involves executing the option when the asset price first falls below a specified threshold. The proof relies on martingale arguments and the fluctuation theory of L\'evy processes. To complement the theoretical findings, we provide numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

      <title>Robustness to noise and erasures of Gabor frames in finite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the robustness of structured frames to measurement noise and erasures, with the focus on Gabor frames $(g, \Lambda)$ with arbitrary sets of time-frequency shifts $\Lambda$. This property of frames is important in many signal processing applications, from wireless communication to phase retrieval and quantization. We aim to analyze the dependence of the frame bounds of such frames on their structure and cardinality and provide constructions of nearly tight Gabor frames with small $\vert \Lambda \vert$. We show that the frame bounds of Gabor frames with a random window $g$ and frame set $\Lambda$ show similar behavior to the frame bounds of random frames with independent entries. Moreover, we study uniform estimates for the frame bounds in the case of measurement erasures. We prove numerical robustness to erasures for mutually unbiased bases frames with erasure rate up to 50\% and show that the Gabor frame generated by the Alltop window can provide results similar to the best previously known deterministic constructions.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic number of random triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chromatic number of typical triangle-free graphs with $\Theta \left( n^{3/2} (\log n)^{1/2} \right)$ edges and establish the width of the scaling window for the transitions from $\chi = 3$ to $\chi = 4$ and from $\chi = 4$ to $\chi = 5$.
  The transition from $3$- to $4$-colorability has scaling window of width $\Theta(n^{4/3} (\log n)^{-1/3})$. To prove this, we show a high probability equivalence of the $3$-colorability of a random triangle-free graph at this density and the satisfiability of an instance of bipartite random $2$-SAT, for which we establish the width of the scaling window following the techniques of Bollob{\'a}s, Borgs, Chayes, Kim, and Wilson.
  The transition from $4$- to $5$-colorability has scaling window of width $\Theta(n^{3/2} (\log n)^{-1/2})$. To prove this, we show a high probability equivalence of the $4$-colorability of a random triangle-free graph at this density and the simultaneous $2$-colorability of two independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs. For this transition, we also establish the limiting probability of $4$-colorability inside the scaling window.</description>

      <title>Totally convex functions, $L^2$-Optimal transport for laws of random measures, and solution to the Monge problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Optimal Transport problem for laws of random measures in the Kantorovich-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$, associated with a Hilbert space $\mathrm{H}$ (with finite or infinite dimension) and for the corresponding quadratic cost induced by the squared Wasserstein metric in $\\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}).$
  Despite the lack of smoothness of the cost, the fact that the space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ is not Hilbertian, and the curvature distortion induced by the underlying Wasserstein metric, we will show how to recover at the level of random measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ the same deep and powerful results linking Euclidean Optimal Transport problems in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ and convex analysis.
  Our approach relies on the notion of totally convex functionals, on their total subdifferentials, and their Lagrangian liftings in the space square integrable $\mathrm{H}$-valued maps $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$
  With these tools, we identify a natural class of regular measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ for which the Monge formulation of the OT problem has a unique solution and we will show that this class includes relevant examples of measures with full support in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ arising from the push-forward transformation of nondegenerate Gaussian measures in $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of the randomly forced Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers(KdVB) equation driven by non-additive white noise. Under reasonable conditions, we show that exponential ergodicity for KdVB equation driven by a space-time localised noise and ergodicity for KdVB equation driven by a multiplicative white noise. Our proof is based on some newly developed analytical properties for KdVB equation, such as Carleman estimate, truncated observability inequality, Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate. Combining these analytical properties with coupling method and asymptotic coupling method, we can investigate the long time behavior of randomly forced KdVB equation.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Expectation-Maximisation and Applications to Gaussian Mixture Model Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in different settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connections existing between max-infinitely divisible distributions and Poisson processes from the point of view of functional analysis. More precisely, we derive functional identities for the former by using well-known results of Poisson stochastic analysis. We also introduce a family of Markov semigroups whose stationary measures are the so-called multivariate max-stable distributions. Their generators thus provide a functional characterization of extreme valued distributions in any dimension. Additionally, we give a few functional identities associated to those semi-groups, namely a Poincar{\'e} identity and commutation relations. Finally, we present a stochastic process whose semigroup corresponds to the one we introduced and that can be expressed using extremal stochastic integrals.</description>

      <title>Canonical Forms as Dual Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dual volume representations of canonical forms for positive geometries in projective spaces, expressing their rational canonical functions as Laplace transforms of measures supported on the convex dual of the semialgebraic set. When the measure is non-negative, we term the geometry completely monotone, reflecting the property of its canonical function. We identify a class of positive geometries whose canonical functions admit such dual volume representations, characterized by the algebraic boundary cut out by a hyperbolic polynomial, for which the geometry is a hyperbolicity region. In particular, simplex-like minimal spectrahedra are completely monotone, with representing measures related to the Wishart distribution, capturing volumes of spectrahedra or their boundaries. We explicitly compute these measures for positive geometries in the projective plane bounded by lines and conics or by a nodal cubic, revealing periods evaluating to transcendental functions. This dual volume perspective reinterprets positive geometries by replacing logarithmic differential forms with probability measures on the dual, forging new connections to partial differential equations, hyperbolicity, convexity, positivity, algebraic statistics, and convex optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a possible extension of probabilistic well-posedness theory of nonlinear dispersive PDEs with random initial data beyond variance blowup. As a model equation, we study the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation (BBM) with Gaussian random initial data. By introducing a suitable vanishing multiplicative renormalization constant on the initial data, we show that solutions to BBM with the renormalized Gaussian random initial data beyond variance blowup converge in law to a solution to the stochastic BBM forced by the derivative of a spatial white noise. By considering alternative renormalization, we show that solutions to the renormalized BBM with the frequency-truncated Gaussian initial data converges in law to a solution to the linear stochastic BBM with the full Gaussian initial data, forced by the derivative of a spatial white noise. This latter result holds for the Gaussian random initial data of arbitrarily low regularity. We also establish analogous results for the stochastic BBM forced by a fractional derivative of a space-time white noise.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically stable revision and comparative probability: a representation theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic) logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a selection function to be representable as a strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games and to revealed preference theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.</description>

      <title>Invariance principle for fragmentation processes derived from conditioned stable Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aldous, Evans and Pitman (1998) studied the behavior of the fragmentation process derived from deleting the edges of a uniform random tree on $n$ labelled vertices. In particular, they showed that, after proper rescaling, the above fragmentation process converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$ to the fragmentation process of the Brownian CRT obtained by cutting-down the Brownian CRT along its skeleton in a Poisson manner.
  In this work, we continue the above investigation and study the fragmentation process obtained by deleting randomly chosen edges from a critical Galton-Watson tree $\mathbf{t}_{n}$ conditioned on having $n$ vertices, whose offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our main results establish that, after rescaling, the fragmentation process of $\mathbf{t}_{n}$ converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$ to the fragmentation process obtained by cutting-down proportional to the length on the skeleton of an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy tree of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$. We further show that the latter can be constructed by considering the partitions of the unit interval induced by the normalized $\alpha$-stable L\'evy excursion with a deterministic drift studied by Miermont (2001).

      <title>Stochastic optimization on matrices and a graphon McKean-Vlasov limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic gradient descents on the space of large symmetric matrices of suitable functions that are invariant under permuting the rows and columns using the same permutation. We establish deterministic limits of these random curves as the dimensions of the matrices go to infinity while the entries remain bounded. Under a ``small noise'' assumption the limit is shown to be the gradient flow of functions on graphons whose existence was established in Oh, Somani, Pal, and Tripathi, \texit{J Theor Probab 37, 1469--1522 (2024)}. We also consider limits of stochastic gradient descents with added properly scaled reflected Brownian noise. The limiting curve of graphons is characterized by a family of stochastic differential equations with reflections and can be thought of as an extension of the classical McKean-Vlasov limit for interacting diffusions to the graphon setting. The proofs introduce a family of infinite-dimensional exchangeable arrays of reflected diffusions and a novel notion of propagation of chaos for large matrices of diffusions converging to such arrays in a suitable sense.</description>

Abstract: We prove that under a multi-scale heavy traffic condition, the stationary distribution of the scaled queue length vector process in any generalized Jackson network has a product-form limit. Each component in the product form follows an exponential distribution, corresponding to the Brownian approximation of a single station queue. The ``single station'' can be constructed precisely and its parameters have a good intuitive interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the study of stochastic games for which each player faces an optimal stopping problem. In our setting, the players may interact through the criterion to optimise as well as through their dynamics. After briefly discussing the N-player game, we formulate the corresponding mean-field problem. In particular, we introduce a weak formulation of the game for which we are able to prove existence of Nash equilibria for a large class of criteria. We also prove that equilibria for the mean-field problem provide approximated Nash equilibria for the N-player game, and we formally derive the master equation associated with our mean-field game.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Mirror Gradient Flow as the limit of the Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of marginals obtained from the iterations of the Sinkhorn algorithm or the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPFP) on joint densities, converges to an absolutely continuous curve on the $2$-Wasserstein space, as the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero and the number of iterations is scaled as $1/\varepsilon$ (and other technical assumptions). This limit, which we call the Sinkhorn flow, is an example of a Wasserstein mirror gradient flow, a concept we introduce here inspired by the well-known Euclidean mirror gradient flows. In the case of Sinkhorn, the gradient is that of the relative entropy functional with respect to one of the marginals and the mirror is half of the squared Wasserstein distance functional from the other marginal. Interestingly, the norm of the velocity field of this flow can be interpreted as the metric derivative with respect to the linearized optimal transport (LOT) distance. An equivalent description of this flow is provided by the parabolic Monge-Amp\`{e}re PDE whose connection to the Sinkhorn algorithm was noticed by Berman (2020). We derive conditions for exponential convergence for this limiting flow. We also construct a Mckean-Vlasov diffusion whose marginal distributions follow the Sinkhorn flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with $L^2$-(super)critical focusing interaction potentials. We establish a precise divergence rate of the partition function as we remove regularization, where the optimal constant is given by (i) (the negative of) the minimum value of the Hamiltonian given an $L^2$-constraint in the $L^2$-critical case and (ii) the optimal constant for certain Bernstein's inequality in the mass-supercritical case. In particular, our result in the $L^2$-critical case precisely quantifies the phase transition of the focusing Gibbs measure at the critical $L^2$ threshold, previously studied by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) and Sosoe, Tolomeo, and the fourth author (2022).</description>

      <title>Free energy and fluctuations in the random normal matrix model with spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large $n$ expansions for the partition function of a Coulomb gas $$Z_n=\frac 1 {\pi^n}\int_{\mathbb{C}^n}\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}|z_i-z_j|^2\prod_{i=1}^n e^{-nQ(z_i)}\, d^2 z_i,$$ where $Q$ is a radially symmetric confining potential on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$.
  The droplet is not assumed to be connected, but may consist of a number of disjoint connected annuli and possibly a central disk. The boundary condition is ``soft edge'', i.e., $Q$ is smooth in a $\mathbb{C}$-neighbourhood of the droplet.
  We include the following possibilities: (i) existence of ``outposts'', i.e., components of the coincidence set which falls outside of the droplet, (ii) a conical (or Fisher-Hartwig) singularity at the origin, (iii) perturbations $Q-\frac h n$ where $h$ is a smooth radially symmetric test-function.
  In each case, the free energy $\log Z_n$ admits a large $n$ expansion of the form \begin{equation*}\log Z_n=C_1n^2+C_2n\log n+C_3 n+C_4\log n+C_5+\mathcal{G}_{n}+o(1)\end{equation*} where $C_1,\ldots,C_5$ are certain geometric functionals. The $n$-dependent term $\mathcal{G}_n$ is bounded as $n\to\infty$; it arises in the presence of spectral gaps.
  We use the free energy expansions to study the distribution of fluctuations of linear statistics. We prove that the fluctuations are well approximated by the sum of a Gaussian and certain independent terms which provide the displacement of particles from one component to another. This displacement depends on $n$ and is expressed in terms of the Heine distribution. We also prove (under suitable assumptions) that the number of particles which fall near a spectral outpost converges to a Heine distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Central Limit Theorem for the log-partition function of 2D directed polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log-partition function $ \log W_N(\beta)$ of the two-dimensional directed polymer in random environment is known to converge in distribution to a normal distribution when considering temperature in the subcritical regime $\beta=\beta_N=\hat{\beta}\sqrt{\pi/\log N}$, $\hat{\beta}\in (0,1)$ (Caravenna, Sun, Zygouras, Ann. Appl. Prob. (2017)). In this paper, we present an elementary proof of this result relying on a decoupling argument and the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables. The argument is inspired by an analogy of the model to branching random walks.</description>

      <title>The giant component of excursion sets of spherical Gaussian ensembles: existence, uniqueness, and volume concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of a well-concentrated giant component in the supercritical excursion sets of three important ensembles of spherical Gaussian random fields: Kostlan's ensemble, band-limited ensembles, and the random spherical harmonics. Our main results prescribe quantitative bounds for the volume fluctuations of the giant that are essentially optimal for non-monochromatic ensembles, and suboptimal but still strong for monochromatic ensembles.
  Our results support the emerging picture that giant components in Gaussian random field excursion sets have similar large-scale statistical properties to giant components in supercritical Bernoulli percolation. The proofs employ novel decoupling inequalities for spherical ensembles which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diffusion approximation error for queueing systems with general primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state diffusion-approximation error for continuous-time queueing systems with generally distributed primitives. Across four canonical systems -- the $G/G/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, the join-the-shortest-queue system, and a two-station tandem queue -- a common picture emerges: the error decomposes into interior and boundary terms. The former are simpler to handle and can be bounded using only low-order moments of the system's primitives -- when the approximation error is measured using the Wasserstein distance, three moments suffice. The boundary terms are inherently more delicate: while crude bounds are easy to obtain, sharper (e.g., order optimal) bounds require deeper, model specific, insights.
  Methodologically, we extend the generator comparison approach of Stein's method to piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). The discontinuous nature of the PDMP at jump times necessitates using the basic adjoint relationship (BAR), instead of the infinitesimal generator, to characterize the stationary distribution. A second-order Taylor expansion of the BAR jump terms, coupled with a Palm-inversion step that converts event-averaged quantities into time averages, yields the candidate diffusion generator and a transparent interior/boundary error decomposition. In parallel, we show how the prelimit generator approach -- working with the Poisson equation of the queueing system instead of the diffusion process -- offers a promising avenue for bounding the challenging boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Universality of the mean-field equations of networks of Hopfield-like neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of characterising the mean-field limit of a network of Hopfield-like neurons. Building on the previous works of Ben Arous and Guionnet we establish for a large class of networks of Hopfield-like neurons, i.e. rate neurons, the mean-field equations on a time interval $[0,\,T]$, $T&gt;0$, of the thermodynamic limit of these networks, i.e. the limit when the number of neurons goes to infinity. Here, we do not assume that the synaptic weights describing the connections between the neurons are i.i.d. as zero-mean Gaussians. The limit equations are stochastic and very simply described in terms of two functions, a ``correlation'' function noted $K_Q(t,\,s)$ and a ``mean'' function noted $m_Q(t)$. The ``noise'' part of the equations is a linear function of the Brownian motion, which is obtained by solving a Volterra equation of the second kind whose resolving kernel is expressed as a function of $K_Q$. We give a constructive proof of the uniqueness of the limit equations. We use the corresponding algorithm for an effective computation of the functions $K_Q$ and $m_Q$, given the weights distribution. Several numerical experiments are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of quadratic RBSDEs and BSDEs with one-sided growth restrictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of bounded and unbounded solutions for reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The generators of these equations satisfy a one-sided growth restriction on the variable $y$ and have a general quadratic growth in the variable $z$. The solutions $Y_t$ (and the obstacles of RBSDEs) take values in either $\mathbf{R}$ or $(0, \infty)$. We obtain the existence of solutions primarily by using the methods from Essaky and Hassani (2011) and Bahlali et al. (2017). For the uniqueness of solutions, we provide a method applicable when the generators are convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$. Our method relies on the $\theta$-difference technique introduced by Briand and Hu (2008), and some comparison arguments based on RBSDEs. We also establish some general comparison theorems for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.</description>

      <title>On the speed of coming down from infinity for subcritical branching processes with pairwise interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the phenomenon of coming down from infinity for subcritical cooperative branching processes with pairwise interactions (BPI processes) under suitable conditions. BPI processes are continuous-time Markov chains that extend classical branching models by incorporating additional mechanisms accounting for both competitive and cooperative interactions between pairs of individuals.
  Our main focus is on characterising the speed at which BPI processes evolve when starting from a very large initial population in the subcritical regime. In addition, we investigate their second-order fluctuations. Furthermore, our results also apply to a class of exchangeable fragmentation-coalescent processes introduced by Berestycki (2004) and several other models from population genetics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the mean field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) with double mean reflections, whose generator and constraints both depend on the distribution of the solution. When the generator is Lipschitz continuous, based on the backward Skorokhod problem with nonlinear constraints, we investigate the solvability of the doubly mean reflected MFBSDEs by constructing a contraction mapping. Furthermore, if the constraints are linear, the solution can also be constructed by a penalization method. For the case of quadratic growth, we obtain the existence and uniqueness results by using a fixed-point argument, the BMO martingale theory and the {\theta}-method.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called polynomial ensembles and its subclass P\'olya ensembles. This latter subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the eigenvalue (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <title>Fourth-Moment Theorems for Sums of Multiple Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nualart &amp; Pecatti ([Nualart and Peccati, 2005, Thm 1]) established the first fourth-moment theorem for random variables in a fixed Wiener chaos, i.e. they showed that convergence of the sequence of fourth moments to the fourth moment of the standard Gaussian distribution is sufficient for weak convergence to the standard Gaussian. In this paper, we provide what we believe to be the first generalization to chaos expansions with more than a single term. Specifically, we show that a fourth-moment theorem holds for random variables consisting of sums of two multiple integrals of orders $p, q \in N$, where $p, q$ have different parities. Furthermore, we show that such random variables cannot themselves be Gaussian, again generalizing what is known for the fixed Wiener chaos setting. Finally, we show a fourth-moment theorem for variables with infinite Wiener chaos expansions when the terms in the expansions are independent and satisfy an additional regularity condition in terms of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator.</description>

      <title>On the critical parameters of branching random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a discrete spatial structure $X$, we define continuous-time branching processes that model a population breeding and dying on $X$. These processes are usually called branching random walks. They are characterized by breeding rates $k_{xy}$ (governing the rate at which individuals at $x$ send offspring to $y$), and by a multiplicative speed parameter $\lambda$. These processes also serve as models for epidemic spreading, where $\lambda k_{xy}$ represents the infection rate from $x$ to $y$. Two critical parameters of interest are the global critical parameter $\lambda_w$, related to global survival, and the local critical parameter $\lambda_s$, related to survival within finite sets (with $\lambda_w\le\lambda_s$). In disease control, the primary goal is to lower $\lambda$ so that the process dies out, at least locally. Nevertheless, a process that survives globally can still pose a threat, especially if sudden changes cause global survival to transition into local survival. In fact, local modifications to the rates can affect the values of both critical parameters, making it important to understand when and how they can be increased. Using results on the comparison of extinction probabilities for a single branching random walk across different sets, we extend the analysis to extinction probabilities and critical parameters of pairs of branching random walks whose rates coincide outside a fixed set $A \subseteq X$. We say that two branching random walks are equivalent if their rates coincide everywhere except on a finite subset of $X$. Given an equivalence class of branching random walks, we prove that if one process has $\lambda^*_w \neq \lambda^*_s$, then $\lambda^*_w$ is the maximal possible value of this parameter within the class. We describe the possible configurations for the critical parameters within these equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ as functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, the locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.
  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Strong averaging principle for nonautonomous multi-scale SPDEs with fully local monotone and almost periodic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of nonautonomous multi-scale stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients. By introducing the evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous Markov semigroups, we study the averaging principle for such kind of system. Specifically, we first prove the slow component in the multi-scale stochastic system converges strongly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients retain the dependence of the scaling parameter. Furthermore, if the coefficients satisfy uniformly almost periodic conditions, we establish that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of another averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. The main contribution of this paper extends the basic nonautonomous framework investigated by Cheng and Liu in [11] to a fully coupled framework, as well as the autonomous framework explored by Liu et al. in [27] to the more general nonautonomous framework. Additionally, we improve the locally monotone coefficients discussed in [11,27] to the fully local monotone coefficients, thus our results can be applied to a wide range of cases in nonlinear nonautonomous stochastic partial differential equations, such as multi-scale stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-heat equation and multi-scale stochastic liquid-crystal-porous-media equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic dynamics of infinite particle systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ interacting through the $d$-dimensional Coulomb potential. For arbitrary inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and all dimensions $d\ge2$, we construct solutions to the associated infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (ISDEs). Our main results establish the existence of strong solutions and their pathwise uniqueness. The resulting labeled process is an $(\mathbb{R}^d)^N$-valued diffusion with no invariant measure, while the associated unlabeled process is reversible with respect to the Coulomb random point field. Furthermore, we prove that finite-particle systems converge to these infinite-particle dynamics, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for Coulomb interacting Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation: Multivariable Systems and Static Bayesian Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1207.5293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a symbolic framework inspired by the Dirac notation in quantum mechanics, to multivariable probability systems and static Bayesian networks (BNs). By introducing PBN for joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions (PDs), as well as marginal and conditional expectations, we demonstrate how to express dependencies among multiple random variables concisely and manipulate them algebraically. Using the well-known Student BN as an example of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we show how to apply PBN to analyze predictions, inferences (using both bottom-up and top-down approaches), and expectations. We also extend PBN to BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes both continuous and discrete random variables, utilizes user-specific data, and provides tailored predictions through discrete-display (DD) nodes as proxies for their continuous variable parents. Compared to traditional probability notation, PBN offers a unifying operator-like framework that simplifies the analysis of probabilistic models. This work highlights the potential of PBN as both an educational tool and a practical framework for probabilistic modeling, paving the way for applications in causal reasoning, inferences, expectations, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: The probability that a zero of a random real polynomial of increasing degree is real tends to zero. However, passing from polynomials to Laurent polynomials yields a surprising result: the probability that a root is real tends not to zero, but to $1/\sqrt{3}$. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for systems of Laurent polynomials in several variables. By considering Laurent polynomials as functions associated with torus representations, we describe an analogous phenomenon for representations of any reductive linear group. In the case of a simple group, we provide a formula for the aforementioned limiting probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of radially symmetric Coulomb gas ensembles at inverse temperature $\beta=2$, for which the droplet consists of a number of concentric annuli, having at least one bounded ``gap'' $G$, i.e., a connected component of the complement of the droplet, which disconnects the droplet. Let $n$ be the total number of particles. Among other things, we deduce fine asymptotics as $n \to \infty$ for the edge density and the correlation kernel near the gap, as well as for the cumulant generating function of fluctuations of smooth linear statistics. We typically find an oscillatory behaviour in the distribution of particles which fall near the edge of the gap. These oscillations are given explicitly in terms of a discrete Gaussian distribution, weighted Szeg\H{o} kernels, and the Jacobi theta function, which depend on the parameter $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply recent ideas about complexity and randomness to the philosophy of laws and chances. We develop two ways to use algorithmic randomness to characterize probabilistic laws of nature. The first, a generative chance* law, employs a nonstandard notion of chance. The second, a probabilistic* constraining law, impose relative frequency and randomness constraints that every physically possible world must satisfy. The constraining notion removes a major obstacle to a unified governing account of non-Humean laws, on which laws govern by constraining physical possibilities; it also provides independently motivated solutions to familiar problems for the Humean best-system account (the Big Bad Bug and the zero-fit problem). On either approach, probabilistic laws are tied more tightly to corresponding sets of possible worlds: some histories permitted by traditional probabilistic laws are now ruled out as physically impossible. Consequently, the framework avoids one variety of empirical underdetermination while bringing to light others that are typically overlooked.</description>

Abstract: We establish functional limit theorems for ergodic sums of observables with power singularities for expanding circle maps. In the regime where the observables have infinite variance, we show that when rescaled by $N^{1/s}(\ln N)^\alpha$, the partial sum process has limit points consisting precisely of increasing piecewise constant functions with finitely many jumps. Our approach combines trimming techniques with a multiple Borel-Cantelli argument. It provides a functional law of the iterated logarithm for heavy-tailed processes where classical almost sure invariance principles do not apply.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any Riemannian foliation with a simply connected and negatively curved leaf space the normal exponential map of a leaf is a diffeomorphism. As an application, if the leaves are furthermore minimal submanifolds, we give a sharp estimate for the bottom of the spectrum of such a Riemannian manifold. Our proof of the spectral estimate also yields an estimate for the bottom of the spectrum of the horizontal Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Limiting eigenvalue distribution of the general deformed Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <title>WeSpeR: Computing non-linear shrinkage formulas for the weighted sample covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the issue of computing the non-linear shrinkage formulas for the weighted sample covariance in high dimension. We use theoretical properties of the asymptotic sample spectrum in order to derive the \textit{WeSpeR} algorithm and significantly speed up non-linear shrinkage in dimension higher than $1000$. Empirical tests confirm the good properties of the \textit{WeSpeR} algorithm. We provide the implementation in PyTorch for it.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of contingency tables and partitions: Two practical examples of the Burnside process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives new, efficient algorithms for approximate uniform sampling of contingency tables and integer partitions. The algorithms use the Burnside process, a general algorithm for sampling a uniform orbit of a finite group acting on a finite set. We show that a technique called `lumping' can be used to derive efficient implementations of the Burnside process. For both contingency tables and partitions, the lumped processes have far lower per step complexity than the original Markov chains. We also define a second Markov chain for partitions called the reflected Burnside process. The reflected Burnside process maintains the computational advantages of the lumped process but empirically converges to the uniform distribution much more rapidly. By using the reflected Burnside process we can easily sample uniform partitions of size $10^{10}$.</description>

      <title>Explainable post-training bias mitigation with distribution-based fairness metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel optimization framework with distribution-based fairness constraints for efficiently producing demographically blind, explainable models across a wide range of fairness levels. This is accomplished through post-processing, avoiding the need for retraining. Our framework, which is based on stochastic gradient descent, can be applied to a wide range of model types, with a particular emphasis on the post-processing of gradient-boosted decision trees. Additionally, we design a broad class of interpretable global bias metrics compatible with our method by building on previous work. We empirically test our methodology on a variety of datasets and compare it to other methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Maritime Transportation Behavior Using AIS Trajectories and Markovian Processes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is central to the global economy, and analyzing its large-scale behavioral data is critical for operational planning, environmental stewardship, and governance. This work presents a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to model vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with particular emphasis on disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the maritime domain into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for distinct vessel types using cell transition frequencies and dwell times. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize maritime dynamics across multiple temporal resolutions. Focusing on commercial, fishing, and passenger vessels, we analyze the temporal evolution of mobility behaviors during the pandemic, highlighting significant yet transient disruptions to recurring transport patterns. The methodology we contribute to this paper allows for an extensive behavioral analytics key for transportation planning. Accordingly, our findings reveal vessel-specific mobility signatures that persist across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting behaviors invariant to time. In contrast, we observe temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, reflecting the influence of social isolation measures and operational constraints on non-essential maritime transport in this region.</description>

      <title>An approximation theory for Markov chain compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the compression of reversible Markov chains with rigorous error control. Given a subset of selected states, we construct reduced dynamics that can be lifted to an approximation of the full dynamics, and we prove simple spectral and nuclear norm bounds on the recovery error in terms of a suitably interpreted Nystr\"{o}m approximation error. We introduce two compression schemes: a projective compression based on committor functions and a structure-preserving compression defined in terms of an induced Markov chain over the selected states. The Nystr\"{o}m error appearing in our bounds can be controlled using recent results on column subset selection by nuclear maximization. Numerical experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Integrable multispecies totally asymmetric stochastic interacting particle systems with homogeneous rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.</description>

      <title>Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</description>
