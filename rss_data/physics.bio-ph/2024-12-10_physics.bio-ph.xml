      <title>Order-disorder phase transition of cell membrane induced by THz irradiation studied via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism by which THz radiation non-thermally affects living organisms, the lateral diffusion constants of lipid molecules in the cell membranes of HeLa cells were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching under THz wave irradiation (THz-FRAP) at frequencies of 0.10, 0.29, and 0.48 THz, with power densities ranging from 20 to 89 mW/cm2. The potential heating effects of the THz irradiation were eliminated through temperature calibration using an ultrathin thermocouple, allowing for the investigation of the non-thermal effects of THz radiation. Irradiation at 0.10 and 0.29 THz induced an increase in diffusion constants at temperatures lower than the cell growth temperature. This suggests that THz irradiation induces the order-disorder phase transition of the cell membrane lipids by affecting the dynamics of bound water molecules. Our findings have important implications for the establishment of safety standards for THz radiation and for the potential development of new methods for cell manipulation using THz irradiation in the future</description>

      <title>Patient-specific prediction of glioblastoma growth via reduced order modeling and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBL) is one of the deadliest brain cancers in adults. The GBL cells invade the physical structures within the brain extracellular environment with patient-specific features. In this work, we propose a proof-of-concept for mathematical framework of precision oncology enabling rapid parameter estimation from neuroimaging data in clinical settings.
  The proposed diffuse interface model of GBL growth is informed by neuroimaging data, periodically collected in a clinical study from diagnosis to surgery and adjuvant treatment. We build a robust and efficient computational pipeline to aid clinical decision-making based on integrating model reduction techniques and neural networks. Patient specificity is captured through the segmentation of the magnetic resonance imaging into a computational replica of the patient brain, mimicking the brain microstructure by incorporating also the diffusion tensor imaging data.
  The full order model (FOM) is first discretized using the finite element method and later approximated by a reduced order model (ROM) adopting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Trained by clinical data, we finally use neural networks to map the parameter space of GBL evolution over time and to predict the patient-specific model parameters from the observed clinical evolution of the tumor mass.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Based Deep Learning for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of muscle activation and muscle forces plays an essential role in neuro-rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder treatments. Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Non-classical Temperature Dependence of Chirality-Induced Magnetization and Its Implications for RNA's Homochirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single-handedness of biomolecules is a characteristic feature of life on Earth, yet achieving and maintaining a homochiral prebiotic network is a significant challenge. In our previous studies, we reached homochirality in an RNA precursor, ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), using magnetized magnetite surfaces as chiral reagents, due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. We further demonstrated that RAO can induce net magnetization on previously demagnetized surfaces, indicating a self-reinforcing feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. However, these processes depend on spin interactions that generally weaken at higher temperatures, raising concerns about the robustness of our mechanisms in natural settings. Additionally, the temperature dependence of CISS remains poorly understood. To address these questions, we investigated the temperature dependence of chirality-induced magnetization. Contrary to classical expectations, we observed a significant increase in induced net magnetization with increasing temperatures, suggesting a phonon-assisted process. Concurrently, we noted a corresponding increase in the relative yield of RAO during its prebiotic synthesis. Our results support a vibronic contribution to CISS and indicate that spin-controlled processes leading to RNA homochirality can occur reliably and effectively over a range of temperatures likely present in prebiotic environments.</description>

      <title>Beating of eukaryotic flagella via Hopf bifurcation of a system of stalled molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of the beating of cilia and flagella in fluids is a particularly active field of study, given the biological relevance of these organelles. Various mathematical models have been proposed to represent the nonlinear dynamics of flagella, whose motion is powered by the work of molecular motors attached to filaments composing the axoneme. Here, we formulate and solve a nonlinear model of activation based on the sliding feedback mechanism, capturing the chemical and configurational changes of molecular motors driving axonemal motion. This multiscale model bridges microscopic motor dynamics with macroscopic flagellar motion, providing insight into the emergence of oscillatory beating. We validate the framework through linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear numerical simulations, showing the onset of spontaneous oscillations. To make the analysis more comprehensive, we compare our approach with two established sliding feedback models.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with saturating rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle whose speed and tumbling rate are space-dependent on an infinite line. Unlike most of the previous work on such models, here we make the physical assumption that at large distances, these rates saturate to a constant. For our choice of rate functions, we show that a stationary state exists, and the exact steady state distribution decays exponentially or faster and can be unimodal or bimodal. The effect of boundedness of rates is seen in the mean-squared displacement of the particle that displays qualitative features different from those observed in the previous studies where it approaches the stationary state value monotonically in time; in contrast, here we find that if the initial position of the particle is sufficiently far from the origin, the variance in its position either varies nonmonotonically or plateaus before reaching the stationary state. These results are captured quantitatively by the exact solution of the Green's function when the particle has uniform speed but the tumbling rates change as a step-function in space; the insights provided by this limiting case are found to be consistent with the numerical results for the general model.</description>
