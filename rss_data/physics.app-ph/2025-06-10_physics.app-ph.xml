      <title>Ge0.95Sn0.05 on Si avalanche photodiode with Spectral Response Cutoff at 2.14 micrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeSn-based avalanche photodiode (APD) operating in shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelength was demonstrated in this work. A separate absorption and charge multiplication (SACM) structure was employed to take advantage of long wavelength absorption in GeSn and low impact ionization ratio of Si. Due to lattice mismatch between Si and GeSn that would degrade GeSn material quality if with direct growth, a 240-nm-thick Ge buffer was utilized which simultaneously allows for the transporting photo generated electrons from GeSn absorber to Si multiplication layer. Spectral response showed the cut off wavelength beyond 2.1 {\mu}m at room temperature. Dart current and capacitance-voltage measurements indicated a punch-through voltage of -10 V. The measured responsivities were 0.55 A/W and 0.34 A/W under 1.55 {\mu}m and 1.9 {\mu}m excitation lasers, respectively. The maximum gain was obtained as 3.44 at 77 K under 1.9 {\mu}m laser. Even at 250 K, the calculated gain was greater than unity. Simulation of electric field distribution revealed that the GeSn is partially depleted at operating voltages, which can be improved by reducing the background doping levels in GeSn absorber and Ge buffer layer.</description>

      <title>Study of electronic band alignment in SiGeSn/GeSn quantum well via internal photoemission effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiGeSn-based optoelectronic devices, which operate across a broad infrared wavelength range, have attracted significant attention, particularly heterostructures utilizing quantum wells are widely utilized. In these structures, band alignment type and barrier height are crucial for carrier confinement, making them highly desirable information to obtain. This work leverages the internal photoemission effect to extract effective barrier heights from a Si0.024Ge0.892Sn0.084 / Ge0.882Sn0.118 single quantum well structure, which was pseudomorphically grown on Ge0.9Sn0.1 and Ge buffered Si substrate. The extracted effective barrier heights are approximately 22{plus minus}2 and 50{plus minus}2 meV for electrons and holes, respectively. Moreover, we have identified the type-I band alignment between GeSn well and SiGeSn barrier, as indicated by an internal photoemission threshold of 555 {plus minus} 1 meV.</description>

      <title>A duality between surface charge and work function in scanning Kelvin probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a powerful technique for macroscopic imaging of the electrostatic potential above a surface. Though most often used to image work-function variations of conductive surfaces, it can also be used to probe the surface charge on insulating surfaces. In both cases, relating the measured potential to the underlying signal is non-trivial. Here, we derive general relationships between the measured SKPM voltage and the underlying source, revealing either can be cast as a convolution with an appropriately scaled point spread function (PSF). For charge that exists on a thin insulating layer above a conductor, the PSF has the same shape as what would occur from a work-function variation alone, differing by a simple scaling factor. We confirm this relationship by: (1) backing it out from finite-element simulations of work-function and charge signals, and (2) experimentally comparing the measured PSF from a small work-function target to that from a small charge spot. This scaling factor is further validated by comparing SKPM charge measurements with Faraday cup measurements for highly charged samples from contact-charging experiments. Our results highlight a hereto unappreciated connection between SKPM voltage and charge signals, offering a rigorous recipe to extract either from experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-contact temperature sensors are widely used, often utilizing infrared light for temperature measurement. However, specific applications demand non-contact detection, particularly within closed containers containing fluids or gases, where optical methods are unsuitable. Our approach is designed precisely for this purpose. We conducted measurements, introduced a prototype of our detector, and confirmed its compatibility with nonmagnetic containers.</description>

      <title>Reduced-weight near-cloaks for underwater invisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limiting the total weight of an acoustic cloak is of fundamental importance in underwater applications, where buoyancy of the cloaked object is desirable. Unfortunately, it is well known that traditional cloaking strategies imply either a mass tending to infinity or a total weight equal to the Archimedes' force, thus making a perfect cloak that preserves the buoyancy of the target impossible. In this paper, we discuss strategies to reduce the weight of the cloak seeking a good compromise between weight reduction and acoustic performance. In particular, we compare and combine two existing strategies: the so-called eikonal cloak, where an impedance mismatched cloak is adopted, and the near-cloak, where a non-singular transformation makes the target equivalent to a smaller obstacle. We show that properly combining these strategies allows to reduce the mass of the cloak while maintaining a scattering reduction in line with the existing literature. We also investigate radially varying mismatch as a way to further improve the balance between scattering reduction and buoyancy.</description>

      <title>On the role of secondary electrons in the color change of high-dose X-ray irradiated topaz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its high brightness, synchrotron light allows for investigating with extreme precision the physical properties of matter. The irradiation with high-dose X-ray beams may also lead to modification of the latter, thus allowing for material processing. Here we investigate the color change of topaz irradiated with synchrotron light, shedding light on the role played by secondary electrons in the formation of color centers. As a matter of fact, treatments of natural topaz to induce its color change are largely used in the jewelry industry. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms behind the topaz's color change have not yet been fully understood. To date, it has been shown that the combined action of high-energy beam irradiation (either electrons, neutrons, or {\gamma}-rays) and thermal annealing permits to provide colorless natural topaz with an artificial blue color, which is largely appealed in the gem market. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to irreversibly provide natural topaz with a blue color even by exploiting lower energy beams, such as X-rays, provided that enough dose is absorbed, thus paving the way for developing novel protocols for making artificially blue topazes.</description>

      <title>A high -quality and -throughput colloidal lithography by mechanical assembly and ice-based transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal lithography has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication techniques, offering the ability to create nanoscale patterns in a cost-effective and scalable manner. However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique that combines rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two applications: (1) antireflective "moth-eye" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring scalable nanostructuring. This work represents a significant advancement in colloidal lithography, addressing critical challenges and unlocking its potential for practical applications in optics, biotechnology, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Force Reconstruction in Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution imaging and quantitative force measurement, which is critical for understanding nanoscale mechanical, chemical, and biological interactions. In dynamic AFM modes, however, interaction forces are not directly measured; they must be mathematically reconstructed from observables such as amplitude, phase, or frequency shift. Many reconstruction techniques have been proposed over the last two decades, but they rely on different assumptions and have been applied inconsistently, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparison. Here, we systematically evaluate major force reconstruction methods in both frequency- and amplitude-modulation AFM, detailing their theoretical foundations, performance regimes, and sources of error. To support benchmarking and reproducibility, we introduce an open-source software package that unifies all widely used methods, enabling side-by-side comparisons across different formulations. This work represents a critical step toward achieving consistent and interpretable AFM force spectroscopy, thereby supporting the more reliable application of AFM in fields ranging from materials science to biophysics.</description>

      <title>Probing Millikelvin Temperature Sensitivity in Chiral Nanoparticles via Optical Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing interest in utilizing nanostructures as nanoscale heat sources, the ability to precisely measure photothermal effects at the nanoscale has become increasingly significant. Techniques based on fluorescence or Raman signals often suffer from challenges in accurate calibration, far-field imaging methods are limited by diffraction-limited spatial resolution, and electron microscopy requires vacuum conditions, restricting in situ applicability. In contrast, tip-based measurement techniques offer sub-diffraction spatial resolution under ambient conditions, making them well-suited for nanoscale photothermal mapping. In this study, we employ tip-based optical force nanoscopy combined with phase-informed decomposition to investigate the origin of the photothermal force, enable nanoscale mapping, and evaluate temperature sensitivity. Our system achieves a temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.1 K without necessitating an additional temperature-sensitive layer. We anticipate that our approach has the potential to serve as a versatile platform for investigating localized thermal effects in fields such as semiconductors, nanophotonics, and photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronically Active GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge Heterojunctions Created via Semiconductor Grafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, advancements in semiconductor devices have been driven by lattice-matched heterojunctions with tailored band alignments through heteroepitaxy techniques. However, there is significant interest in expanding the capabilities of heterojunction devices, in particular utilizing extreme lattice mismatches. We demonstrate the manipulation of device behaviors and performance enhancement achievable through a lattice-mismatched, single-crystalline GaAs/GeSn-multi-quantum well (MQW)/Ge n-i-p heterojunction by employing advanced semiconductor grafting technology. With engineered band alignment and optical field distribution, the grafted GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge n-i-p photodiode achieved outstanding performance: a record-low dark current density of 1.22E10^-7 A/cm^2, an extended spectral response from ~0.5 to 2 um, and improved photoresponsivity of RVIS of 0.85 A/W and RNIR of 0.40 A/W at 520 and 1570 nm, respectively. The dark current density is at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art GeSn photodiodes. The photoresponsivity demonstrates an approximately sevenfold enhancement in the VIS range and a threefold improvement in the NIR range compared to the reference epitaxial photodiode. This work presents a unique strategy for constructing lattice-mismatched semiconductor heterojunction devices. More importantly, the implications transcend the current GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge example, offering potential applications in other material systems and freeing device design from the stringent lattice-matching constraints of conventional heteroepitaxy.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable nonvolatile flatband absorbers in the mid-infrared with wide spectral tuning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advances in reconfigurable photonics have provided new avenues for manipulating light on the subwavelength scale, on-demand control of infrared absorption remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a plasmonic metasurface based on the phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 with in-situ electrically-switchable infrared absorption in the 3-5 microns wavelength range. Unlike traditional infrared microstructures based on volatile phase change materials, our device does not require the external stimuli to be continuously applied in order to maintain a given optical state, thus enabling zero static power operation. Furthermore, the 400x deep-subwavelength field localization supported by our device not only allows robust tuning of its spectral response but also makes its absorptivity independent of the angle of incidence, thus enabling a flatband behavior. We conduct switching of our device using rapid thermal annealing and reversible switching using electrical pulses over 26 cycles. Our device provides new avenues for infrared absorption control and serves as a steppingstone for the next generation of mid-wave infrared photonics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coloration in Core-Shell Plasmonic Nanopixels Based on Organic Conductive Polymers: A First-Principles and FDTD Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From raindrops to planets, the scattering of electromagnetic fields introduces exciting phenomena that can be utilized for display devices. Here, we designed an electrochromic nanoparticle on mirror (eNPoM) structure with core-shell geometries for low-power nanoscale pixels with rapid coloration abilities based on four electrochromic organic conducting polymers utilizing the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Au nanoparticles are coated with electrochromic conductive polymers (such as PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh) and positioned on the metal mirror. The electric field enhancement and the impact of shell thickness are analyzed. Dielectric properties of all polymers resulting from atomistic calculation were utilized for FDTD simulation, which helps to correlate the direct relationship between polymer structure and optical properties. Notably, the study reveals significant wavelength tunability of 100nm, 40nm, 70nm, and over 40nm using PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh shells, respectively. Additionally, the potential for RGB color production using a TiN layer on the mirror is explored. For the first time, complex structures such as bow tie and gear were utilized to model the nanopixels studied and a significant absorption peak shift was observed. Chromaticity coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space and CIELAB2000 color difference quantify color change capabilities during the redox cycle, and a comparative analysis of organic and inorganic materials highlights the prospects of the proposed plasmonic nanopixels.</description>

      <title>Roles of Non-switchable Domains and Internal Bias in Electrocaloric and Pyroelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state cooling and energy harvesting via pyroelectric effect (PEE) and electrocaloric effect (ECE) in ferroelectric thin films could be enhanced beyond their intrinsic ferroelectric response by exploiting the recently observed direction-dependent enhancement of the PEE; however, its microscopic origin remains unknown. Herein, we report direct hysteresis measurements of pyrocurrent ($I_{\rm p}$) and ECE-induced temperature change versus bias voltage in 1-$\mu$m-thick Pb(Zr$_{0.65}$Ti$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ capacitors. Both hysteresis loops exhibit pronounced asymmetries along the voltage and response axes. By superimposing direct current voltage offsets, we isolate a residual $I_{\rm p}$-axis shift, revealing a contribution of non-switchable ferroelectric polarization. This non-switchable polarization can be converted into switchable polarization via poling with bipolar triangular pulses, confirming the governing role of defect-induced domain pinning. After 100 pulses, time-dependent aging was observed for pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses, with the switchable contribution markedly decaying and the non-switchable component remaining nearly constant, indicating partial repinning. The change in voltage-axis shift agrees well with the ratio of non-switchable to switchable polarization, demonstrating that voltage shift also arises from pinned domains. These insights clarify the critical role of non-switchable polarization in the PEE and ECE performance, suggesting strategies to optimize the directional response in ferroelectric devices through controlled poling and defect engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting inductors with impedance surpassing the resistance quantum, i.e., superinductors, are important for quantum technologies because they enable the development of protected qubits, enhance coupling to systems with small electric dipole moments, and facilitate the study of phase-slip physics. We demonstrate superinductors with densely packed meandered traces of granular aluminum (grAl) with inductances up to $4\,\mu\mathrm{H}$, achieving impedances exceeding $100\,\mathrm{k}\Omega$ in the $4-8\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Ring resonators made with grAl meandered superinductors exhibit quality factors on the order of $10^5$ in the single-photon regime and low non-linearity on the order of tens of $\mathrm{Hz}$. Depending on the grAl resistivity, at $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$, we measure frequency noise spectral densities in the range of $10^2$ to $10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. In some devices, in the single-photon regime, we observe a positive Kerr coefficient of unknown origin. Using more complex fabrication, the devices could be released from the substrate, either freestanding or suspended on a membrane, thereby further improving their impedance by a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Strain Transfer and Optoelectronic Performance in MoS2 Devices via Formvar Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the influence of polyvinyl formal (PVFM), commonly known as Formvar, in comparison to polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), as encapsulation materials on the strain performance of MoS2 monolayer and bilayer flakes on flexible polypropylene (PP) substrates. Notably, optical differential reflectance measurements reveal that PVFM and PMMA encapsulation significantly enhances the mechanical and thermal strain gauge factors by approximately 2-fold (up to ~-50 meV/%) and 6-fold (up to ~-1.5 meV/{\deg}C), respectively, while PC shows a slightly lower enhancement. Moreover, all three polymers increase the maximum achievable strain from approximately 1.4% to 2.3%. Furthermore, devices fabricated on PP substrates exhibit improved optoelectronic performance when encapsulated with PVFM, including increased and faster photocurrent response and extended device lifetime.</description>

      <title>Stark Tuning and Charge State Control in Individual Telecom C-Band Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telecom-wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single-photons compatible with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in a InP-based $n^{++}$--$i$--$n^{+}$ heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired individuals. The antennas, being a crucial component of these systems, must be lightweight, flexible, low-cost, and compact. However, existing antennas suffer from a rigid form factor and limited reconfigurability. This article presents a low-profile, fast scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The novel meandering microstrip design allows independent control of gain and scanning rate (rate of change of main beam pointing direction with frequency). Experimental results show that the LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -35{deg} to 45{deg} over the operating frequency band, while the half power beamwidth (HPBW) is within 20{deg} in planar condition. To assess the on-body applicability, the antenna's performance is evaluated under bending. When placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius), the beam steers from -25{deg} to 55{deg} with a maximum realized gain degradation of 1.75 dB, and an increase of HPBW up to 25{deg}. This demonstrates the LWA's robustness in conformal conditions, while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning capabilities. Simulations confirm that the LWA's ground plane minimizes user exposure, adhering to international guidelines. Finally, we demonstrate a 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, enabling beam-forming in the E-plane from -50{deg} to 50{deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{deg}. Mutual coupling analysis reveals that isolation loss and active reflection coefficient remain below 15 dB throughout the operating band.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Embedded Element Patterns of Reactively Loaded Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06291v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing reactively loaded antennas and antenna arrays. The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Neuron Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Low-Power Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Model of Sorption-Induced Static Mode Nanomechanical Sensing for Multi-Component Analytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomechanical sensors and their arrays have attracted significant attention for detecting, distinguishing, and identifying target analytes, especially complex mixtures of odors. In the static mode operation, sensing signals are obtained by a concen-tration-dependent sorption-induced mechanical strain/stress. Understanding of the dynamic responses is crucial for develop-ing practical artificial olfaction; however, the analytical formulations are still limited to single-component analytes. Here, we derive an analytical model of viscoelastic material-based static mode nanomechanical sensing for multi-component analytes by extending the theoretical model via solving differential equations. The present model can reduce the dynamic responses to the multi-component target analytes observed in the experimental signal responses. Moreover, the use of optimized fitting parameters extracted from pure vapors with viscoelastic parameters allows us to predict the concentration of each analyte in the multi-component system.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative and reproducible optical characterization of single quantum emitters is crucial for quantum photonic materials research, yet controlling for experimental conditions remains challenging due to a lack of an established reference standard. We propose nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) color centers as reliable, stable and robust sources of single-photon emission. We select 4 potential reference emitter candidates from a study of thousands of NV$^{-}$ centers. Candidates were remeasured at a second laboratory, correlating optical pump power and NV$^{-}$ center emission intensity at saturation in addition to corresponding $g^{(2)}(0)$ values. A reference nanodiamond is demonstrated to control for experimental conditions, with reproducible and reliable single-photon emission, as a model for a new single-photon emitter reference standard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties. However, direct and oriented synthesis is challenging due to low formation energies that lead to rapid, uncontrolled growth during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during deposition reveals formation of the n =1 phase at the ear;y stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) confirm a single oriented n = 1 phase, independent of the substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth on strained epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ remain stable for over 184 days without any sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films and stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Highly Uniform Thermally Undercut Silicon Photonic Devices in a 300 mm CMOS Foundry Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut process in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5$\times$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 $\mu$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40$\times$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale comparison of non-undercut and undercut silicon photonic devices using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Further, we demonstrate a comprehensive wafer-scale analysis of the influence of undercut trench opening geometry on device tuning efficiency. Notably, we observe highly uniform performance across the full 300 mm wafer for multiple device types, emphasizing that our process can be scaled to large-scale photonic circuits with high yield. These results open new opportunities for large-scale integrated photonic circuits using thermo-optic devices, paving the way for scalable, low-power silicon photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>
