      <title>A tutorial on panel data analysis using partially observed Markov processes via the R package panelPomp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R package panelPomp supports analysis of panel data via a general class of partially observed Markov process models (PanelPOMP). This package tutorial describes how the mathematical concept of a PanelPOMP is represented in the software and demonstrates typical use-cases of panelPomp. Monte Carlo methods used for POMP models require adaptation for PanelPOMP models due to the higher dimensionality of panel data. The package takes advantage of recent advances for PanelPOMP, including an iterated filtering algorithm, Monte Carlo adjusted profile methodology and block optimization methodology to assist with the large parameter spaces that can arise with panel models. In addition, tools for manipulation of models and data are provided that take advantage of the panel structure.</description>

      <title>Best Linear Unbiased Estimate from Privatized Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, it can be beneficial to release "redundant" outputs, in the sense that a quantity can be estimated by combining different combinations of privatized values. Indeed, this structure is present in the DP 2020 Decennial Census products published by the U.S. Census Bureau. With this structure, the DP output can be improved by enforcing self-consistency (i.e., estimators obtained by combining different values result in the same estimate) and we show that the minimum variance processing is a linear projection. However, standard projection algorithms are too computationally expensive in terms of both memory and execution time for applications such as the Decennial Census. We propose the Scalable Efficient Algorithm for Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (SEA BLUE), based on a two step process of aggregation and differencing that 1) enforces self-consistency through a linear and unbiased procedure, 2) is computationally and memory efficient, 3) achieves the minimum variance solution under certain structural assumptions, and 4) is empirically shown to be robust to violations of these structural assumptions. We propose three methods of calculating confidence intervals from our estimates, under various assumptions. We apply SEA BLUE to two 2010 Census demonstration products, illustrating its scalability and validity.</description>

      <title>Scalable mixed-domain Gaussian process modeling and model reduction for longitudinal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models that combine both categorical and continuous input variables have found use in longitudinal data analysis of and computer experiments. However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions, which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process samplers using couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods -- such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) samplers -- provide asymptotically exact estimators of expectations under a target distribution. There is growing interest in alternatives to this asymptotic regime, in particular in constructing estimators that are exact in the limit of an infinite amount of computing processors, rather than in the limit of an infinite number of Markov iterations. In particular, Jacob et al. (2020) introduced coupled MCMC estimators to remove the non-asymptotic bias, resulting in MCMC estimators that can be embarrassingly parallelised. In this work, we extend the estimators of Jacob et al. (2020) to the continuous-time context and derive couplings for the bouncy, the boomerang and the coordinate samplers. Some preliminary empirical results are included that demonstrate the reasonable scaling of our method with the dimension of the target.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo with Inexact Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an unbiased method for Bayesian posterior means based on kinetic Langevin dynamics that combines advanced splitting methods with enhanced gradient approximations. Our approach avoids Metropolis correction by coupling Markov chains at different discretization levels in a multilevel Monte Carlo approach. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed estimator is unbiased, attains finite variance, and satisfies a central limit theorem. It can achieve accuracy $\epsilon&gt;0$ for estimating expectations of Lipschitz functions in $d$ dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-2})$ expected gradient evaluations, without assuming warm start. We exhibit similar bounds using both approximate and stochastic gradients, and our method's computational cost is shown to scale independently of the size of the dataset. The proposed method is tested using a multinomial regression problem on the MNIST dataset and a Poisson regression model for soccer scores. Experiments indicate that the number of gradient evaluations per effective sample is independent of dimension, even when using inexact gradients. For product distributions, we give dimension-independent variance bounds. Our results demonstrate that in large-scale applications, the unbiased algorithm we present can be 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than the ``gold-standard" randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>LASPATED: a Library for the Analysis of SPAtio-TEmporal Discrete data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe methods, tools, and a software library called LASPATED, available on GitHub (at https://github.com/vguigues/) to fit models using spatio-temporal data and space-time discretization. A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</description>

      <title>Noise-free comparison of stochastic agent-based simulations using common random numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of every agent-based model (ABM) of health and disease. By representing each individual in a synthetic population, agent-based models enable detailed analysis of intervention impact and parameter sensitivity. Yet agent-based modeling has a fundamental signal-to-noise problem, in which small changes between simulations cannot be reliably differentiated from stochastic noise resulting from misaligned random number realizations. We introduce a novel methodology that eliminates noise due to misaligned random numbers, a first for agent-based modeling. Our approach enables meaningful individual-level analysis between ABM scenarios because all differences are driven by mechanistic effects rather than random number noise. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three disparate examples. Results consistently show reductions in the number of simulations required to achieve a given standard error with levels exceeding 10-fold for some applications.</description>
