      <title>Energy-Efficient Cryogenic Neuromorphic Network with Superconducting Memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic neuromorphic systems, inspired by the brains unparalleled efficiency, present a promising paradigm for next generation computing architectures.This work introduces a fully integrated neuromorphic framework that combines superconducting memristor(SM) based spiking neurons and synapse topologies to achieve a low power neuromorphic network with non volatile synaptic strength.This neurosynaptic framework is validated by implementing the cart pole control task, a dynamic decision making problem requiring real time computation.Through detailed simulations, we demonstrate the network's ability to execute this task with an average fitness of 5965 timesteps across 1000 randomized test episodes, with 40 percent achieving the target fitness of 15,000 timesteps (0.02s per timestep).The system achieves 23 distinct spiking rates across neurons, ensuring efficient information encoding.Our findings establish the potential of SM based cryogenic neuromorphic systems to address the energy and scalability limitations of traditional computing, paving the way for biologically inspired, ultra low power computational frameworks.</description>

      <title>Solving Boolean satisfiability problems with resistive content addressable memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving optimization problems is a highly demanding workload requiring high-performance computing systems. Optimization solvers are usually difficult to parallelize in conventional digital architectures, particularly when stochastic decisions are involved. Recently, analog computing architectures for accelerating stochastic optimization solvers have been presented, but they were limited to academic problems in quadratic polynomial format. Here we present KLIMA, a k-Local In-Memory Accelerator with resistive Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) and Dot-Product Engines (DPEs) to accelerate the solution of high-order industry-relevant optimization problems, in particular Boolean Satisfiability. By co-designing the optimization heuristics and circuit architecture we improve the speed and energy to solution up to 182x compared to the digital state of the art.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Transformer Models for Image Super-Resolution: Techniques, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, which has been affected by a specific degradation process. This is achieved by enhancing detail and visual quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based methods have remolded image super-resolution by enabling high-quality reconstructions surpassing previous deep-learning approaches like CNN and GAN-based. This effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, such as limited receptive fields, poor global context capture, and challenges in high-frequency detail recovery. Additionally, the paper reviews recent trends and advancements in transformer-based SR models, exploring various innovative techniques and architectures that combine transformers with traditional networks to balance global and local contexts. These neoteric methods are critically analyzed, revealing promising yet unexplored gaps and potential directions for future research. Several visualizations of models and techniques are included to foster a holistic understanding of recent trends. This work seeks to offer a structured roadmap for researchers at the forefront of deep learning, specifically exploring the impact of transformers on super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>LLM-Ehnanced Holonic Architecture for Ad-Hoc Scalable SoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern system of systems (SoS) become increasingly adaptive and human centred, traditional architectures often struggle to support interoperability, reconfigurability, and effective human system interaction. This paper addresses these challenges by advancing the state of the art holonic architecture for SoS, offering two main contributions to support these adaptive needs. First, we propose a layered architecture for holons, which includes reasoning, communication, and capabilities layers. This design facilitates seamless interoperability among heterogeneous constituent systems by improving data exchange and integration. Second, inspired by principles of intelligent manufacturing, we introduce specialised holons namely, supervisor, planner, task, and resource holons aimed at enhancing the adaptability and reconfigurability of SoS. These specialised holons utilise large language models within their reasoning layers to support decision making and ensure real time adaptability. We demonstrate our approach through a 3D mobility case study focused on smart city transportation, showcasing its potential for managing complex, multimodal SoS environments. Additionally, we propose evaluation methods to assess the architecture efficiency and scalability,laying the groundwork for future empirical validations through simulations and real world implementations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</description>
