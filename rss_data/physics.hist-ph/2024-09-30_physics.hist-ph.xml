      <title>The Supernova of 1054AD, the Armenian chronicle of Hetum, and Cronaca Rampona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3865</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.3865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rareness of nearby supernovae ensures particular value to the historic records for determination of their light curves. We provide the translation of 13th century Armenian chronicle of Hetum, which by its unexpected association to Cronaca Rampona and other chronicles can influence the debates whether there are reliable European records of the supernova of 1054 AD, as well as the analysis of the records vs the conjunction with the Moon and their role in assigning of the Type I or II to that supernova.</description>

      <title>How can scientists establish an observer-independent science? Embodied cognition, consciousness and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.15428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence is growing for the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that action and perception co-determine each other, forming an action-perception loop. This suggests that we humans somehow participate in what we perceive. So, how can scientists escape the action-perception loop to obtain an observer-independent description of the world? Here we present a set of conjectures informed by the philosophy of mind and a reverse-engineering of science and quantum physics to explore this question. We argue that embodiment, as traditionally understood, can manifest aspects of imaginary-time quantum dynamics. We then explore what additional constraints are required to obtain aspects of genuine, real-time quantum dynamics. In particular, we conjecture that an embodied scientist doing experiments must be described from the perspective of another scientist, which is ignored in traditional approaches to embodied cognition, and that observers play complementary roles as both objects experienced by other observers and ``subjects'' that experience other objects.</description>
