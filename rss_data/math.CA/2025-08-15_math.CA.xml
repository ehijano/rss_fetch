      <title>An analytical parameterization for all solutions of the two-dimensional moment problem under Carleman-type conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional moment problem consists of finding a positive Borel measure $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} t_1^m t_2^n d\mu = s_{m,n}$, $m,n=0,1,2,...$, where $s_{m,n}$ are prescribed real constants (moments). We study this moment problem in the case when the sequence $\{ s_{m,n} \}_{m,n=0}^\infty$ is positive semi-definite, and the following Carleman-type conditions hold: $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{ \sqrt[2k]{ s_{2m,2k} + s_{2m+2,2k} } } = \infty,\quad m=0,1,2,.... $$ In this case all solutions of the moment problem are parameterized by a class of analytic contractive operator-valued functions. The special case of the determinate moment problem is characterized. We introduce a notion of a generalized resolvent for a pair of commuting symmetric operators. We use basic properties of such generalized resolvents as a main tool in studying the above moment problem.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Confluent hypergeometric kernel determinant on multiple large intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confluent hypergeometric point process represents a universality class which arises in a variety of different but related areas. It particularly describes the local statistics of eigenvalues in the bulk of spectrum near a Fisher-Hartwig singular point for a broad class of unitary ensembles. It is the aim of this work to investigate large gap asymptotics of this process over a union of disjoint intervals $\cup_{j=0}^{n}(sa_j,sb_j)$, where $a_0&lt;b_0&lt;\dots&lt;a_m&lt;0&lt;b_m&lt;\dots&lt;a_n&lt;b_n$ for some $0\leq m \leq n$. As $s\to +\infty$, we establish a general asymptotic formula up to and including the oscillatory term of order $1$, which involves a $\theta$-functions-combination integral along a linear flow on an $n$-dimensional torus. If the linear flow has ``good Diophantine properties'' or the ergodic properties, we further improve the error estimate or the leading term for the asymptotics of the integral. These results can be combined for the case $n=1$, which lead to a precise large gap asymptotics up to an undetermined constant.</description>

      <title>Modular differential equations and orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study second-order modular differential equations whose solutions transform equivariantly under the modular group. In the reducible case, we construct all such solutions using an explicit ansatz involving Eisenstein series and the $J$-invariant, reducing the problem to an algebraic system. We show that the roots of this system are captured by orthogonal polynomials satisfying a Fuchsian differential equation. Their recurrence, norms, and weight function are derived, completing the classification of equivariant solutions in this setting.</description>

      <title>Compactness of the Bloom sparse operators and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the characterization of compactness for the sparse operator (associated with symbol in weighted VMO space) in the two weight setting on the spaces of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss. As a direct application we obtain the compactness characterization for the maximal commutators with respect to the weighted VMO functions and the commutator of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on the homogeneous spaces. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to compactness characterization for operators in the multilinear Bloom setting.</description>

      <title>Nevai's condition for measures with unbounded supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the three dimensional Maxwell-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we prove global well-posedness for the massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the Lorenz gauge in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, for small, sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data, as well as modified scattering for the solutions. Heuristically we exploit the close connection between the massive Maxwell-Dirac and the wave-Klein-Gordon equations, while developing a novel approach which applies directly at the level of the Dirac equations. The modified scattering result follows from a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions inside the light cone, which we derive via the method of testing with wave packets of Ifrim-Tataru.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary (Fibonacci) words of 1's and 2's, graded by digit sum. Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549--568), we define clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ that generate random Fibonacci words of increasing length; unlike for the Young lattice (powered by the classical Schur functions), clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations -- parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. Second, we connect Fibonacci positivity with: (i) total positivity of tridiagonal matrices; (ii) Stieltjes moment sequences; (iii) the combinatorics of set partitions; and (iv) families of univariate orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme. We further link moment sequences of orthogonal polynomials to combinatorial structures on Fibonacci words, a connection that may be of independent interest. Third, we analyze scaling limits of the induced random words, obtaining stick-breaking-type limits (linked to GEM laws), new dependent stick-breaking limits, and limits supported on the discrete part of the Martin boundary of $\mathbb{YF}$. These results significantly extend the asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$ proved by Gnedin--Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), 433--446).
  Finally, we prove Cauchy-type identities for clone Schur functions with quadridiagonal-determinant right-hand side (in contrast to the product form for classical Schur functions), and construct models of random permutations and involutions from Fibonacci-positive specializations together with a Robinson--Schensted correspondence adapted to $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. A key development is the reformulation of the reverse sampling process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE), which allows for efficient sampling using high-order numerical solvers. Unlike traditional time integrator analysis, the accuracy of this sampling procedure depends not only on numerical integration errors but also on the approximation quality and regularity of the learned score function, as well as their interaction. In this work, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of deterministic samplers derived from probability flow ODEs for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules. Specifically, we develop and analyze $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes, under the practical assumption that the first and second derivatives of the learned score function are bounded. We prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions can be bounded as \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension, and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum solver step size. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets further confirm that the derivatives of the learned score function are bounded in practice.</description>
