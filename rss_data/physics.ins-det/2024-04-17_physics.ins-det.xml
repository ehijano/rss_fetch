      <title>A newly developed multi-kilo-channel high-speed and precision waveform digitization system for neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jinping Neutrino Experiment(JNE), conducted within the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, aims to detect and analyze of solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and supernova neutrinos. A one-ton prototype will soon be in commision with an upgrade from 30 channels to 60 channels, which will increase the data bandwidth by one to two orders of magnitude and exceed the capacity of the current CAEN DAQ system. Additionally, enhancing the performance and flexibility of JNE DAQ system is crucial. This paper presents the design of a new Tsinghua DAQ system for the JNE and its performance and stability. The new Tsinghua DAQ(THDAQ) system for JNE is based on the cPCI protocol and demonstrates powerful performance improvements: ADC ENOB of the THDAQ system approximately exceeds 9.8-bit, marking a 14% improvement over the CAEN DAQ system; The maximum clock deviation within a single chassis is 85.6 ps, satisfying sub-nanosecond synchronization criteria; Each DAQ board features two QSFP+ optical ports with 82.5Gbps transmission capability, while the PCIe board supports a transmission rate of 100.2 Gbps. In addition, comparative experiments between the two systems were also tested in detail. The analysis results of waveform and charge spectrum prove the high stability of the THDAQ system. This provides a foundation for the 60-channel and 4000-channel DAQ systems.</description>

      <title>Millisecond-resolved infrared spectroscopy study of polymer brush swelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of millisecond-resolved polymer brush swelling dynamics using infrared spectroscopy with a custom-built quantum cascade laser-based infrared spectrometer at a 1 kHz sampling rate after averaging. By cycling the humidity of the environment of the polymer brush, we are able to measure the swelling dynamics sequentially at different wavenumbers. The high sampling rate provides us with information on the reconformation of the brush at a higher temporal resolution than previously reported. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we study the brush swelling dynamics as a reference experiment and to correct artefacts of the infrared measurement approach. This technique informs on the changes in the brush thickness and refractive index. Our results indicate that the swelling dynamics of the polymer brush are poorly described by Fickian diffusion and the Berens-Hopfenberg formalism, pointing toward more complicated underlying transport.</description>

      <title>Advances in Atom Interferometry and their Impacts on the Performance of Quantum Accelerometers On-board Future Satellite Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry have cleared the path for space applications of quantum inertial sensors, whose level of stability is expected to increase dramatically with the longer interrogation times accessible in space. In this study, a comprehensive in-orbit model is developed for a Mach-Zehnder-type cold-atom accelerometer. Performance tests are realized under different assumptions, and the impact of various sources of errors on instrument stability is evaluated. Current and future advances for space-based atom interferometry are discussed, and their impact on the performance of quantum sensors on-board satellite gravity missions is investigated in three different scenarios: state-of-the-art scenario, near-future (between the next 5 and 10 years) and far-future scenarios (between the next 10 to 20 years). We show that one can achieve a sensitivity level close to 5E-10 with the current state-of-the-art technology. We also estimate that in the near and far-future, atom interferometry in space is expected to achieve sensitivity levels of 1E-11 and 1E-12, respectively. A roadmap for improvements in atom interferometry is provided that would maximize the performance of future CAI accelerometers, considering their technical capabilities. Finally, the possibility and challenges of having ultra-sensitive atom interferometry in space for future space missions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A 25-micron single photon sensitive kinetic inductance detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements characterizing the performance of a kinetic inductance detector array designed for a wavelength of 25 microns and very low optical background level suitable for applications such as a far-infrared instrument on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. In a pulse counting mode of operation at low optical flux, the detectors can resolve individual 25-micron photons. In an integrating mode, the detectors remain photon noise limited over more than six orders of magnitude in absorbed power from 70 zW to 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of 4.6 x 10^-20 W/rtHz at 1 Hz. In addition, the detectors are highly stable with flat power spectra under optical load down to 1 mHz. Operational parameters of the detector are determined including the efficiency of conversion of the incident optical power into quasiparticles in the aluminum absorbing element and the quasiparticle self-recombination constant.</description>

      <title>Realization of Planar Optical Tweezer (2D-LOT) Powered by Light Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the realization of the first planar optical tweezer trap system by a sheet of light. To visualize the trapping of the target object (dielectric bead or live cell) in a plane, an orthogonal widefield detection is employed. The planar / two-dimensional lightsheet optical tweezer (2D-LOT) sub-system is realized in an inverted microscopy mode with illumination from the bottom. A 1064 nm laser (power $\sim 500 mW$) is expanded and directed to a combination of cylindrical lens and high NA objective lens to generate a tightly-focused diffraction-limited light sheet. The object to be trapped is injected in the specimen chamber (consists of two coverslips placed at a distance of $\approx 1~mm$) using a syringe. The illumination of trap-laser light is along Z-direction (with coverslip along XZ-plane) whereas, the detection is achieved perpendicular to the coverslip (along Y-axis). The orthogonal detection is employed to directly visualize the trapping in a plane. The characterization of system PSF estimates the size of light sheet trap PSF to be, $2073.84 ~\mu m^2$ which defines the active trap region / area. Beads are tracked on their way to the trap region for determining the trap stiffness along Z and X i.e, $k_z = 1.13 \pm 0.034 ~pN/\mu m$ and $k_x = 0.74 \pm 0.021 ~pN/ \mu m$. Results (image and video) show real-time trapping of dielectric beads in the trap zone (2D plane) generated by the light sheet. The beads can be seen getting trapped from all directions in the XZ-plane. Prolonged exposure to the light sheet builds up a 2D array of beads in the trap zone. Similar experiments on live NIH3T3 cells show cells trapped in the 2D trap. The potential of the planar trap lies in its ability to confine objects in two dimensions, thereby opening new kinds of experiments in biophysics, atomic physics, and optical physics.</description>

      <title>Reactor neutrino physics potentials of cryogenic pure-CsI crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a world-leading scintillation light yield among inorganic crystals measured from a 0.5~kg pure-CsI detector operated at 77 Kelvin. Scintillation photons were detected by two 2-inch Hamamatsu SiPM arrays equipped with cryogenic front-end electronics. Benefiting the light yield enhancement of pure-CsI at low temperatures and the high photon detection efficiency of SiPM, a light yield of 30.1 photoelectrons per keV energy deposit was obtained for X-rays and $\gamma$-rays with energies from 5.9~keV to 59.6~keV. Instrumental and physical effects in the light yield measurement are carefully analyzed. This is the first stable cryogenic operation of kg-scale pure-CsI crystal readout by SiPM arrays at liquid nitrogen temperatures for several days. The world-leading light yield opens a door for the usage of pure-CsI crystal in several fields, particularly in detecting the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of reactor neutrinos. The potential of using pure-CsI crystals in neutrino physics is discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Towards a realistic noise modelling of quantum sensors for future satellite gravity missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and gradiometers have emerged as promising candidates for future gravimetric satellite missions due to their potential for detecting gravitational forces and gradients with high precision and accuracy. Current satellite gravimetry missions have demonstrated the utility of gravity data in understanding global mass transport phenomena, climate dynamics, and geological processes. However, state-of-the-art measurement techniques face noise and long-term drift limitations, which might propagate on the recovery of Earth's time-varying gravity field. Quantum sensors, particularly atom interferometry-based devices, offer promise for improving the accuracy and stability of space-based gravity measurements. This study explores the sensitivity of CAI accelerometers and gradiometers. We explore the low-low satellite-to-satellite and gravity gradiometry measurements to build analytical models of measurements and associated errors. We selected an ambitious scenario for CAI parameters that illustrates a potential path for increasing instrument accuracies and capabilities for space gravimetry. Two operational modes, concurrent and sequential, are compared to mitigate the effects of inaccurately known attitude rates on Coriolis accelerations. The sequential mode shows the potential to reduce these effects since the atom cloud has initial zero velocity, otherwise the Corilis effects are dominant in the concurrent operational mode. The CAI configuration considered in this study allows for the time variable gravity signal to be observed for the case of low-low Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking missions, but is inadequate to gravity gradient missions because of the reduced signal amplitude.</description>

      <title>Combined Pre-Supernova Alert System with Kamland and Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preceding a core-collapse supernova, various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming core-collapse supernova can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande have been monitoring pre-supernova neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande on pre-supernova neutrino detection. A pre-supernova alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the Super-Kamiokande detector is developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-supernova neutrino signal from a 15 M$_{\odot}$ star within 510 pc of the Earth, at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hours in advance.</description>
