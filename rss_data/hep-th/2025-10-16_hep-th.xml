      <title>Diffeomorphism invariant tensor networks for 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</description>

      <title>Tests of restricted Quantum Focusing and a universal CFT bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT. We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d&gt;2$, we derive a new CFT constraint: the coincident limit of the product of two averaged null energy operators in any CFT cannot be zero. Equivalently, the rQFC imposes an upper bound of $2d-1$ on the scaling dimension of the leading even-spin Regge trajectory, analytically continued in $J$ and evaluated at $J=3$. The bound holds in free and weakly-interacting CFTs, and is saturated by the double-trace trajectories in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling. We speculate about a strengthened Quantum Null Energy Condition that would imply our results.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional Disorder and Logarithmic Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory. Motivated by the logarithmic behavior often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping logarithmic defects.</description>

      <title>Open case for a closed universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new no-go theorem for cosmology: spatially flat (k=0) and open (k=-1) Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) non-static spacetimes cannot be simultaneously nonsingular, geodesically complete, and consistent with the averaged null energy condition (ANEC). Equivalently, any dynamic flat or open universe that is complete must violate the ANEC. By contrast, closed universes (k=+1) uniquely admit nonsingular, geodesically complete, ANEC-consistent solutions, with global de Sitter space as the canonical realization that saturates the ANEC. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that positive spatial curvature naturally mimics the phenomenology of phantom dark energy (w&lt;-1), biasing flat-model reconstructions of w(z) at the 1% level. These results sharpen the classical singularity theorems, establish a new classification of eternal cosmologies, and motivate renewed scrutiny of spatial curvature in both theory and observation.</description>

      <title>De Sitter holographic complexity from Krylov complexity in DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the recent connection between the high energy limit of the double-scaled SYK model and two-dimensional de Sitter solutions of sine dilaton gravity to identify the length of a family of geodesics spanned between future and past infinities with Krylov spread complexity. This constitutes an explicit top-down microscopic realization of holographic complexity in a cosmological spacetime. Our identification is different from the existing holographic complexity proposals for de Sitter geometries which are anchored either on horizons as holographic screens or on timelike observers. This leads us to introduce and investigate a new cosmological holographic complexity proposal in any dimension. It is based on extremal timelike volumes anchored at the asymptotic past and future and at large values of the anchoring boundary coordinate grows linearly with growth rate proportional to the product of de Sitter entropy and temperature.</description>

      <title>Shadow sectors of gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories admit configurations in which the fields behave as if in the presence of static charge densities, or ``shadow charges". These correspond to nontrivial initial conditions for the fields that generate gauge transformations, the Gauss' law operators. In non-abelian theories, such configurations seem to demand additional physical fields with exactly static charge densities. In contrast with this expectation, we show that gauge theory alone provides a consistent and gauge-invariant description of shadow charges. Canonical quantization then yields continuous shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized ones for non-abelian theories. In general, our findings indicate that all local conservation laws give rise to gauge symmetries, even in the presence of second-class constraints.</description>

      <title>Tracking discontinuities in parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework in Feynman-parameter space to determine constraints on the sequential discontinuities of Feynman integrals. Our method is based on tracking the deformation of the integration contour as external kinematics are analytically continued. This procedure imposes powerful constraints on the analytic structure of Feynman integrals, providing crucial inputs for their bootstrap. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to integrals in dimensional regularization, with higher propagator powers, and to examples with non-uniform transcendental weight. The method is illustrated with several one- and two-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>On $\beta$-function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric integrable sigma models II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue studying regularization scheme dependence of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric sigma models. In the present work the previous result for the four loop $\beta$-function is extended to the five loop order. Namely, we find the renormalization scheme, in which the fifth loop contribution is completely eliminated, while the fourth loop contribution is represented by the certain invariant, which is coordinate independent for the metrics of some models. These models include complete $T$-duals of the $\eta$-deformed $SU(n)/U(n-1)$ models, as well as $\eta$- and $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ models, whose metrics solve the RG flow equation up to the fifth loop order. We also comment on the $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ and $SU(3)/U(2)$ case, showing that they satisfy five-loop RG flow equation, and discuss their K\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Twistor Wilson loops in large-$N$ Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for many years that, in Yang-Mills theories with $\mathcal{N}=4,2,2^*$ supersymmetry, certain nontrivial supersymmetric Wilson loops exist with v.e.v. either trivial or computable by localization that arises from a cohomological field theory, which also computes the nonperturbative prepotential in $\mathcal{N}=2,2^*$ theories. Moreover, some years ago it has been argued that, in analogy with the supersymmetric case, certain nontrivial twistor Wilson loops with trivial v.e.v. to the leading large-$N$ order exist in pure SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and are computed, to the leading large-$N$ order, by a topological field/string theory that, to the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order, conjecturally captures nonperturbative information on the glueball spectrum and glueball one-loop effective action as well. In fact, independently of the above, it has also been claimed that "every gauge theory with a mass gap should contain a possibly trivial topological field theory in the infrared", so that the aforementioned twistor Wilson loops realize a stronger version of this idea, as they have trivial v.e.v. at all energy scales and not only in the infrared. In the present paper, we provide a detailed proof of the triviality of the v.e.v. of twistor Wilson loops at the leading large-$N$ order in Yang-Mills theory that has previously been only sketched, opening the way to further developments.</description>

      <title>Unitarity of partially broken massless higher-spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we suggest a partially broken version of the Skvortsov-Vasiliev (SV) model for massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The traceless gauge parameter of the Weyl transformation is now required to be transverse. In the light-cone gauge we offer a simple proof that the model contains only spin-$s$ helicities as propagating modes. In the $s=3$ and $s=4$ cases we are able to calculate the two point amplitude and confirm unitarity in a explicitly Lorentz invariant way.
  For the recently suggested partially broken Fronsdal model, for $s=3$ and $s=4$, unitarity is also confirmed in a Lorentz invariant way from their two point amplitudes. In both Fronsdal and SV partially broken models the two point amplitudes differ from their unbroken counterparts by contact terms which guarantees the same particle content but indicates potential non-equivalence of possible interacting terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze equations describing gravitational waves in the Myers-Perry and Gibbons-Lu-Page-Pope geometries with arbitrary rotation parameters. Assuming that at least one rotation parameter vanishes, we demonstrate full separability of equations for several polarizations of gravitational waves and analyze the resulting ODEs. We also construct some examples of separable solutions describing gravitational excitations of black holes with the maximal number of rotation parameters.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Schwinger Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient, inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles, obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>The tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of complex Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tt*-equation (topological-anti-topological fusion equation) was introduced by S. Cecotti and C. Vafa for describing massive deformation of supersymmetric conformal field theories. B. Dubrovin formulated the tt*-equation as a flat bundle, called tt*-structure. In this paper, we construct a tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian of complex \(k\)-plane and obtain global solutions to the tt*-equation, following the idea of Bourdeau. We give a precise mathematical formulation and a description of the solutions by using p.d.e. theory and the harmonic map theory developed by J. Dorfmeister, F. Pedit and H. Wu (the DPW method). Furthermore, we give an isomorphism between tt*-structure for the \(k\)-th exterior product of tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the complex projective space and the tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Mirror Pairs: The Beginning of the End</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d mirror pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the internal inconsistency of the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model. Our proof is based on three assumptions. The first assumption is that in the full theory the structure of counter temcs coincides with the structure of the counter terms in the perturbation theory. The second assumption is the positivity of norm states - no ghosts in the spectrum of the model. The third assumption is that the canonical commutation relations among generalized coordinates and momenta are valid in renormalized theory. The obtained results mean that there are negative norm states in the spectrum of the WZ model.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one parameter family of holographic solutions in classical string theory in three spacetime dimensions. In Euclidean space, the solutions interpolate smoothly without developing a conical singularity between the cigar black hole times a (non contractible) spatial circle and a thermal solution which has a (non contractible) temporal circle. We study the phase transition and the holographic entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: We show that the 't Hooft anomaly of a quantum field theory with continuous flavor symmetry can be detected from rearrangements of the topological defect webs implementing the global symmetry in general spacetime dimension, which is concretized in 2D by the F-moves of the defect lines. Via dualizing the defects to flat background gauge field configurations, we characterize the 't Hooft anomaly by various cohomological data of the symmetry group, where the cohomology of Lie groups with discrete topology plays the central role. We find that an extra dimension emerges naturally as a consequence of the mathematical description of the 't Hooft anomaly in the case of flat gauging.</description>

      <title>On Krylov Complexity as a Probe of the Quantum Mpemba Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry, Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases where the total complexity fails to do so.</description>

      <title>Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality $D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with $N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx 0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.</description>

      <title>Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature: following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization. Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability as a description of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge and of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the vacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies that the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark condensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are not directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with chirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining electric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature T_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears suggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a very smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has been further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy density, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as N_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We have analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above T_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid. When N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the three-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally symmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems that become very large at T &gt; T_ch. Consequently the stringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the overlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark "mesons" with a very small mean free path.</description>

      <title>The Good Qualities of the Weak Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model motivates the existence of a good quality weak axion $a_W$, associated with the spontaneous breaking of $B\!+\!L$. Its anomalous couplings and tiny mass, generated from electroweak instantons, render $a_W$ photophobic. We find that the strongest bound on the associated decay constant, $f_W$, stems from a loop-induced coupling to electrons, leading to $f_W \gtrsim 1000$ TeV from stellar cooling. Spontaneous breaking of the abelian ${B\!+\!L}$ symmetry induces proton decay via higher dimensional operators controlled by a new physics scale, $\Lambda$. Existing Super-Kamiokande limits on these decay channels constrain the new physics scale to be $\Lambda \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The characteristic channel $p\to e^+ a_W$ and other possible operators mediating interactions with the Standard Model fields yield signals which are not detectable within the allowed parameter space. Future proton decay searches at the next-generation of neutrino experiments offer the most promising avenues to test the good qualities of the weak axion paradigm.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <title>Magnetic D-brane solitons: skyrmion strings ending on a N\'eel wall in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a D-brane.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified view of agnostic parametrizations for deformed black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations and Integrability of Quantum Field Theories with Time-dependent Interaction Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of solving quantum field theories with time dependent interaction strengths. We show that the recently formulated framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], which is a generalization of the regular Bethe ansatz technique, provides the exact many-body wavefunction. In this framework, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is reduced to a set of analytic difference equations and matrix difference equations, called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations. The consistency of the solution gives rise to constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths. For interaction strengths satisfying these constraints, the system is integrable, and the solution to the qKZ and the analytic difference equations provides the explicit form of the many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example by considering the $SU(2)$ Gross-Neveu model with time dependent interaction strength. Using this framework we solve the model with the most general time-dependent interaction strength and obtain the explicit form of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed matter systems for realizing these models.
  In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study de Sitter JT gravity in the canonical formulation to illustrate constructions of Hilbert spaces in quantum gravity, which is challenging due to the Hamiltonian constraints. The key ideas include representing states as "invariants" (solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or dual "co-invariants" (equivalence classes under gauge transformations), defining a physical inner product by group averaging, and relating this to Klein-Gordon inner products via gauge-fixing conditions. We identify a rich Hilbert space with positive-definite inner product which splits into distinct sectors, mirroring a similar structure in the classical phase space. Many (but not all) of these sectors are described exactly (in a constant extrinsic curvature gauge) by a mini-superspace theory, a quantum mechanical theory with a single constraint.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions of baryon and determinant operators for the chiral algebras obtained from the twist of N = 4 SYM with U(N) gauge group. In the context of Twisted Holography, we conjecture that a dual description should involve a D1-D5 brane system, and we construct from the correlators a candidate dual brane in the form of a derived coherent sheaf in SL(2,C). Extending this analysis, we compute similar baryon/determinant correlators of chiral algebras in symmetric and antisymmetric representations of SO and Sp gauge groups and construct the candidate dual branes. These branes exhibit Z_2 identifications consistent with conjectures relating SO/Sp chiral algebras to Kodaira-Spencer theory on SL(2,C)/Z_2 and the Type I topological string on SL(2,C).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of multi-twist operators in general CFTs, we study the leading-twist states of the $N$-body problem in AdS at large spin $J$. We find that for the majority of states the effective quantum-mechanical problem becomes semiclassical with $\hbar=1/J$. The classical system at $J=\infty$ has $N-2$ degrees of freedom, and the classical phase space is identified with the positive Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{+}(2,N)$. The quantum problem is recovered via a Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a classical Hamiltonian, which we describe explicitly. For $N=3$ the classical system has one degree of freedom and a detailed structure of the spectrum can be obtained from Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. For all $N$, we show that the lowest excited states are approximated by a harmonic oscillator and find explicit expressions for their energies.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <title>On The Black Hole Weak Gravity Conjecture and Extremality in the Strong-Field Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) implies that sufficiently small extremal black holes are necessarily in the strong-field regime of electrodynamics, and therefore probe the UV completion of the Maxwell sector. To investigate the WGC bounds arising from these small extremal black holes, we revisit black hole decay in generic field theories in asymptotically flat space. We derive a necessary and a sufficient condition for any black hole to decay, the latter amounting to a bound on the growth of charge relative to mass. We apply these conditions to extremal black holes derived in various UV completions of the Maxwell sector. We find that the Euler-Heisenberg and DBI effective actions satisfy the sufficient condition for decay, while the ModMax model fails the necessary one, rendering it incompatible with the WGC. Using the decay conditions, we show that the black hole WGC implies positivity of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling beta function. This provides an independent argument that classically stable (embedded-Abelian) colored black holes cannot exist. We also show that the black hole WGC constrains conformal hidden sector models, and is always satisfied in their AdS dual realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied an $SO(4)$ gauged $O(5)$ Skyrmion on $\mathbb{R}^4$ which can be seen as a static soliton in $4+1$ dimensions. This is a sequel of the known $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrmions on $\mathbb{R}^D$ in $D=2$ and in $D=3$, like which they are localised to an absolute scale and are topologically stable, their energies being bounded below by the winding number. In the absence of an analytic proof of existence some such solutions are constructed numerically. Two families of solutions are found, of which only one possesses a gauge decoupling limit. The curvatures of both of these solutions decay as $r^{-3}$, a property they share with the Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Symmetries of Planar Feynman Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the invariance of scalar Feynman graphs of any planar topology under the Yangian level-one momentum symmetry given certain constraints on the propagator powers. The proof relies on relating this symmetry to a planarized version of the conformal simplices of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis. In particular, this proves a momentum-space analogue of the position-space conformal condition on propagator powers. When combined with the latter, the invariance under the level-one momentum implies full Yangian symmetry of the considered graphs. These include all scalar Feynman integrals for which a Yangian symmetry was previously demonstrated at the level of examples, e.g. the fishnet or loom graphs, as well as generalizations to graphs with massive propagators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the potential experimental relevance of magnetically affected heavy-quark diffusion, we consider here a five-dimensional nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model to not only holographically model the QCD thermodynamics in a magnetic background, but also to probe the charged inner structure of a heavy quarkonium. The dual model's gravitational equations of motion can be solved in analytical form via the potential reconstruction method. Using a variety of tools -- spectral functions, hydrodynamic expansions or hanging strings -- we study the anisotropic diffusion constants and heavy-quark number susceptibility, each time reporting closed form expressions.</description>

      <title>$dS$ extremal surfaces, replicas, boundary Renyi entropies in $dS/CFT$ and time entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop further previous work on de Sitter extremal surfaces and time entanglement structures in quantum mechanics. In the first part, we first discuss explicit quotient geometries. Then we construct smooth bulk geometries with replica boundary conditions at the future boundary and evaluate boundary Renyi entropies in $dS/CFT$. The bulk calculation pertains to the semiclassical de Sitter Wavefunction and thus evaluates pseudo-Renyi entropies. In 3-dimensions, the geometry in quotient variables is Schwarzschild de Sitter. The 4-dim $dS$ geometry involves hyperbolic foliations and is a complex geometry satisfying a regularity criterion that amounts to requiring a smooth Euclidean continuation. Overall this puts on a firmer footing previous Lewkowycz-Maldacena replica arguments based on analytic continuation for the extremal surface areas via appropriate cosmic branes.
  In the second part (independent of de Sitter), we study various aspects of time entanglement in quantum mechanics, in particular the reduced time evolution operator, weak values of operators localized to subregions, a transition matrix operator with two copies of the time evolution operator, autocorrelation functions for operators localized to subregions, and finally future-past entangled states and factorization. Based on these, we then give some comments on a cosmological transition matrix using the de Sitter Wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Hilbert spaces: invariant and co-invariant states, inner products, gauge-fixing, and BRST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert spaces in theories of gravity are notoriously subtle due to the Hamiltonian constraints, particularly regarding the inner product. To demystify this subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity, and connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space interpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional (or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual ideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by requiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and explain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate that the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner product. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we explain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group averaging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the BRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and other physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and Gaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in the semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Study of chaos and scrambling in hairy AdS Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the Poincar\'e section. We perform an independent spectral analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic methods -- entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we heuristically consider the region near the soliton tip to provide the infrared physics of scrambling in analogy with the near-horizon region of a black hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties. Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the hair parameter.</description>

      <title>Scattering in the dual regime of Yang-Baxter deformed O(2N) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue to explore the previously suggested dual regime of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models, which is a new one-parametric deformation of the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ model. It can be obtained from the conventional YB deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N+2)$ sigma model by freezing two isometries. The scattering matrix in the non-deformed $\mathrm{O}(n)$ model is known to coincide with the rational $\mathfrak{so}_n$-invariant $R-$matrix. For $n = 2N$ this rational solution allows for two trigonometric deformations: the usual $D_N^{(1)}$ and the twisted $D_{N}^{(2)}$. The usual one is known to coincide with the scattering matrix of the conventional $\mathrm{YB-O}(2N)$ model. A natural question to ask is what sigma model corresponds to the twisted solution. In this work we claim that it is precisely our dual regime of $\mathrm{YB-O}(2N)$. We find the corresponding unitarizing function $F_N(\theta)$ explicitly, and, as a bonus, extract some physical properties of this system using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the scalar-tensor modification of the gravitational field of an ultrarelativistic particle beam and its effect on a test particle that is used as sensor. To do so, we solve the linearized scalar-tensor gravity field equations sourced by an energy-momentum tensor of a moving point particle. The geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation then predict the acceleration of the test particle as well as the momentum transfer due to a passing source. Comparing the momentum transfer predicted by general relativity and scalar tensor gravity, we find that there exists a relevant parameter regime where this difference increases significantly with the velocity of the source particle. Since ultrarelativistic particles are available at accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, ultraprecise acceleration sensors in the vicinity of the particle beam could potentially detect deviations from general relativity or constrain modified gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gases to an exponentially expanding universe - The Finsler-Friedmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Do Black Holes With Generalized Entropy Violate Bekenstein Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general yes, but also not quite. It is known that if the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by some kind of generalized entropy, then the Bekenstein bound may be grossly violated. In this work, we show that this undesired violation can be avoided if we employ the equivalence between generalized entropy and varying-$G$ gravity (GEVAG). In this approach, modifying entropy necessarily also modifies gravity (as one should expect if gravity is indeed inherently tied to thermodynamics), which leads to an effective gravitational "constant" $G_\text{eff}$ that is area-dependent, and a thermodynamic energy that is distinct from the ADM mass. We show that a relaxed Bekenstein bound of the form $S \leqslant CRE$ is always satisfied, albeit the coefficient $C$ is no longer $2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. This is a major advantage of the effective metric approach compared to previous GFT studies limited to volume perturbations. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that, in a very simple example, inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Considering that our results were obtained within a number of simplifying assumptions [...], we discuss how going beyond these assumptions could lead to a more desirable phenomenology. Overall, our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>Probing the sensitivity of anisotropic flow coefficients to the initial nuclear structure in pO and OO collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC have injected $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei in their accelerator complexes with a focus on investigating collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. The $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei are known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. This paper attempts to study the clustered-nuclear-geometry dependence of anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei. The study is performed in pO and OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$~TeV and 7~TeV respectively, employing a hybrid model encompassing IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods\,--\,Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are estimated. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for pO and OO collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. While the effect of $\alpha$-clustering in pO is found to be small, it is significant for each observable studied in OO collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of this effect has a noteworthy dependence on the size of the \textsuperscript{4}He.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the two-point field-strength correlation $g^2 \langle G_{\mu\nu}^a(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s') \rangle$ in the Landau gauge in SU(2) and SU(3) quenched lattice QCD, as well as the gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\nu^b(s') \rangle$. The Landau-gauge gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\mu^a(s') \rangle$ is well described by the Yukawa-type function $e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ for $r=0.1-1.0~{\rm fm}$ in both SU(2) and SU(3) QCD. Next, motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum, we investigate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \perp)) \rangle$ ($\hat \perp$: unit vector on the $xy$-plane), and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \parallel) \rangle$ ($\hat \parallel$: unit vector on the $tz$-plane). These two quantities reproduce all the correlation of $g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries in the Landau gauge. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. In contrast, the parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region of $r \gtrsim 0.4~{\rm fm}$, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to a significant cancellation in the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Finally, we decompose the field-strength correlation into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$ in the Landau gauge.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale.
  This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).</description>

      <title>Instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups, involutions on quiver varieties, and quantum symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moduli spaces of instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups are examples of fixed point sets of involutions on quiver varieties, i.e., $\sigma$-quiver varieties. In 2018 Yiqiang Li considered their equivariant cohomology, and by stable envelope of Maulik-Okounkov, constructed representations of coideal subalgebras of Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, called twisted Yangian. We calculate $K$-matrices as matrices in examples, identified the twisted Yangians with ones studied in other literature, and clarify conditions which we should impose to make them well-defined.</description>
