      <title>Schatten $p$-norm and numerical radius inequalities with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01962v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new refinement of the Kato's inequality and using this refinement we obtain several upper bounds for the numerical radius of a bounded linear operator as well as the product of operators, which improve the well known existing bounds. Further, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the positivity of $2\times 2$ certain block matrices and using this condition we deduce an upper bound for the numerical radius involving a contraction operator. Furthermore, we study the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities for the sum of two $n\times n$ complex matrices via singular values and from the inequalities we obtain the $p$-numerical radius and the classical numerical radius bounds. We show that for every $p&gt;0$, the $p$-numerical radius $w_p(\cdot): \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb C)\to \mathbb R$ satisfies $ w_p(T) \leq \sqrt{\frac12\left\| |T|^{2(1-t)}+|T^*|^{2(1-t)} \right\|^{} \, \big \||T|^{2t}+|T^*|^{2t} \big\|_{p/2}^{} } $ for all $t\in [0,1]$. Considering $p\to \infty$, we get a nice refinement of the well known classical numerical radius bound $w(T) \leq \sqrt{\frac12 \left\| T^*T+TT^* \right \|}.$
  As an application of the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities we develop a bound for the energy of graph. We show that
  $ \mathcal{E}(G) \geq \frac{2m}{ \sqrt{ \max_{1\leq i \leq n} \left\{ \sum_{j, v_i \sim v_j}d_j\right\}} },$ where $\mathcal{E}(G)$ is the energy of a simple graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ such that degree of $v_i$ is $d_i$ for each $i=1,2,\ldots,n.$</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for the invertibility of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invertibility of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space and the related Douglas problem are long standing open problems. In this paper we study the invertibility problem under the novel geometric condition on the image of the symbols, which relaxes the standard positivity condition. We show that under our geometric assumption, the Toeplitz operator $T_\varphi$ is invertible if and only if the Berezin transform of $|\varphi|$ is invertible in $L^{\infty}$. It is well known that the Douglas problem is still open for harmonic functions. We study a class of rather general harmonic polynomials and characterize the invertibility of the corresponding Toeplitz operators. We also give a number of related results and examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fourier Diffraction Theorem and Filtered Backpropagation for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns diffraction-tomographic reconstruction of an object characterized by its scattering potential. We establish a rigorous generalization of the Fourier diffraction theorem in arbitrary dimension, giving a precise relation in the Fourier domain between measurements of the scattered wave and reconstructions of the scattering potential. With this theorem at hand, Fourier coverages for different experimental setups are investigated taking into account parameters such as object orientation, direction of incidence and frequency of illumination. Allowing for simultaneous and discontinuous variation of these parameters, a general filtered backpropagation formula is derived resulting in an explicit approximation of the scattering potential for a large class of experimental setups.</description>

      <title>The space of Hardy-weights for quasilinear operators on discrete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for $p$-Schr\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs. Specifically, we prove a Maz'ya-type result, where we characterize the space of Hardy weights for $ p $-Schr\"odinger operators via a generalized capacity. The novel ingredient in the proof is the demonstration that the simplified energy of the $ p $-Schr\"odinger energy functional is compatible with certain normal contractions. As a consequence, we obtain a necessary integrability criterion for Hardy weights. Finally, using some tools of criticality theory, we investigate the existence of minimizers in the Hardy inequalities and discuss relations to Cheeger type estimates.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness and Fell bundles over discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural concept of positive definiteness for bundle maps between Fell bundles over (possibly different) discrete groups and describe several examples. Such maps induce completely positive maps between the associated full cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras in a functorial way. Under the assumption that the kernel of the homomorphism connecting the groups under consideration is amenable, they also induce completely positive maps between the associated reduced cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras. As an application, we define an approximation property for a Fell bundle over a discrete group which generalizes Exel's approximation property and still implies the weak containment property. Both approximation properties coincide when the unit fibre is nuclear.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry, and more specifically on Carnot groups, we consider the set of maps defined on a Hilbert space $H$: \[\mathscr{P}_{d}^m(H)=\bigg\{f:H\to \mathbb{R}^m\,\bigg|\, \forall\, E\subset H, \,\dim(E)&lt;\infty \implies f|_{E} \textrm{ is a polynomial map of degree $d$}\bigg\}.
  \] Example of maps belonging to this class are: the map $f:\ell^2\to \mathbb{R}$ constructed by Kukpa as a counterexample for the Sard theorem in infinite dimension; the Endpoint maps of Carnot groups.
  We prove that, for infinite-dimensional subspaces $V \subset H$ satisfying quantitative assumptions on their Kolmogorov $n$-width, the restriction of $f$ on $V$ has the Sard property, i.e. the set of critical values of $f|_{V}$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^m$. We prove various quantitative versions of this result, allowing to study the Sard property also for the case $V=H$. By constructing suitable examples, we prove the sharpness of our $n$-width assumptions.
  We apply these results to sub-Riemannian geometry, proving that on Carnot groups the Sard property holds true for the restriction of the Endpoint map on the set of real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence. This is a more functional-analytic approach to the Sard conjecture that, unlike previous ones, does not resort to reduction to finite-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Frames via Unilateral Iterations of a Bounded Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work in Dynamical Sampling, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a frame in a separable and infinite-dimensional Hilbert space to admit the form $\{T^{n} \varphi \}_{n \geq 0}$ with $T \in B(H)$. Also, a characterization of all the vectors $\varphi$ for which $\{T^{n} \varphi \}_{n \geq 0}$ is a frame for some $T \in B(H)$ is provided. Some auxiliary results on operator representations of Riesz frames are given as well.</description>

      <title>Stability via closure relations with applications to dissipative and port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider differential operators $A$ that can be represented by means of a so-called closure relation in terms of a simpler operator $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$ defined on a larger space. We analyze how the spectral properties of $A$ and $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$ are related and give sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the semigroup generated by $A$ in terms of the semigroup generated by $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$.
  As applications we study the long-term behaviour of a coupled wave-heat system on an interval, parabolic equations on bounded domains that are coupled by matrix valued potentials, and of linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with dissipation on an interval.</description>

      <title>Unique wavelet sign retrieval from samples without bandlimiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a signal from magnitudes of its wavelet frame coefficients when the analyzing wavelet is real-valued. We show that every real-valued signal can be uniquely recovered, up to global sign, from its multi-wavelet frame coefficients \[ \{\lvert \mathcal{W}_{\phi_i} f(\alpha^{m}\beta n,\alpha^{m}) \rvert: i\in\{1,2,3\}, m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\} \] for every $\alpha&gt;1,\beta&gt;0$ with $\beta\ln(\alpha)\leq 4\pi/(1+4p)$, $p&gt;0$, when the three wavelets $\phi_i$ are suitable linear combinations of the Poisson wavelet $P_p$ of order $p$ and its Hilbert transform $\mathscr{H}P_p$. For complex-valued signals we find that this is not possible for any choice of the parameters $\alpha&gt;1,\beta&gt;0$, and for any window. In contrast to the existing literature on wavelet sign retrieval, our uniqueness results do not require any bandlimiting constraints or other a priori knowledge on the real-valued signals to guarantee their unique recovery from the absolute values of their wavelet coefficients.</description>

      <title>On numerical diameters and linear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the diameter of the numerical range of bounded operators on Hilbert space and the induced seminorm, called the numerical diameter, on bounded linear maps between operator systems which is sensible in the case of unital maps and their scalar multiples. It is shown that the completely bounded numerical diameter is a norm that is comparable but not equal to the completely bounded norm. This norm is particularly interesting in the case of unital completely positive maps and their sections.</description>
