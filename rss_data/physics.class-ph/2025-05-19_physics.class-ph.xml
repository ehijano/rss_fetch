      <title>Capacitance of a Cube and a Hollow Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extended the surface element method proposed by Reitan and Higgins for calculating the capacitance of cubes, subdividing each face of a cube into up to \(600 \times 600 \) Subsquares. When each face was divided into \(90 \times 90\) Subsquares, the capacitance of the unit cube reached a maximum value of \(0.6608\) cm (\(0.7352\) pF). We further applied this method to compute the capacitance of hollow cylinders by dividing them into \(q\) annular rings (each \( 1\) cm in width), with each ring subdivided into \(m\) square elements ( \(1\) cm side length). The capacitance of hollow cylinders under varying \(q/m\) ratios was calculated and compared with Lekner's numerical results and Cavendish's experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement with both.</description>

      <title>The Hyperbolic Tangent as an Educational Tool for Teaching Variable Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approximate analytical solution to the Falling Astronaut Problem by means of the hyperbolic tangent, and it explores the educational opportunities presented by this technique. The author's previous paper presented a function for time in terms of position t(x) that modeled the motion of an astronaut as she falls from an arbitrary height to the surface of a spherical planet with no air resistance, but an exact analytical function for position in terms of time x(t) was not found. This paper derives an approximate function for x(t) using kinematic equations with constant acceleration and "switch functions," specifically the hyperbolic tangent. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pedagogical implications of the technique, its potential for deepening student understanding of non-constant motion, and applications beyond the classroom.</description>

      <title>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH2 under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Equinoctial Elements and Rodrigues Parameters: A New Set of Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>

      <title>Dirac-von Neumann Axiomatic Structure for Classical Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in \textit{classical} electromagnetism that parallels the Hilbert Space of quantum mechanics. The axioms of this classical theory are the so-called Dirac-von Neumann axioms, however, with classical potentials in place of the wavefunction and the indeterministic collapse postulate removed. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is a unique classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory, which simply reflects its wavenature. A classical analogue of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is developed for electromagnetic waves, and its implications discussed. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) classical mechanics (for point particles), and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate an elegant, completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical Lie commutators for electromagnetism.</description>
