      <title>Unitary and Open Scattering Quantum Walks on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of Unitary Quantum Walks on arbitrary graphs, parameterized by a family of scattering matrices. These Scattering Quantum Walks model the discrete dynamics of a system on the edges of the graph, with a scattering process at each vertex governed by the scattering matrix assigned to it. We show that Scattering Quantum Walks encompass several known Quantum Walks. Additionally, we introduce two classes of Open Scattering Quantum Walks on arbitrary graphs, also parameterized by scattering matrices: one class defined on the edges and the other on the vertices of the graph. We show that these walks give rise to proper Quantum Channels and describe their main spectral and dynamical properties, relating them to naturally associated classical Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary Wightman CFTs and non-unitary vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an equivalence of categories between: (i) M\"obius vertex algebras which are equipped with a choice of generating family of quasiprimary vectors, and (ii) (not-necessarily-unitary) M\"obius-covariant Wightman conformal field theories on the unit circle. We do not impose any technical restrictions on the theories considered (such as finite-dimensional conformal weight spaces or simplicity), yielding the most general equivalence between these two axiomatizations of two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory. This provides new opportunities to study non-unitary vertex algebras using the lens of algebraic conformal field theory and operator algebras, which we demonstrate by establishing a non-unitary version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem.</description>

      <title>The ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first counter-example showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This property had been conjectured to hold for decades and it plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counter-example involves an external potential generated by six nuclei of small fractional charges, placed far away from each other. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is proved to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. In addition, we show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. Although the conjecture remains open for real nuclei (of integer charges), our work sets some doubt on the validity of the energy convexity for general atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Landau-Pekar Formula for the effective Mass of the Polaron at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fr\"ohlich polaron in the regime of strong coupling and prove the asymptotically sharp lower bound on the effective mass $m_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)\geq \alpha^4 m_{\mathrm{LP}}-C\alpha^{4-\epsilon}$, where $m_{\mathrm{LP}}$ is an explicit constant. Together with the corresponding upper bound, which has been verified recently in [5], we confirm the validity of the celebrated Landau-Pekar formula [12] from 1948 for the effective mass $\underset{\alpha\rightarrow \infty}{\lim}\alpha^{-4}m_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)=m_{\mathrm{LP}}$ as conjectured by Spohn [25] in 1987.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey article, written for the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, 2nd edition, is devoted to the remarkable family of operators introduced by Charles Dunkl and to their $q$-analogues discovered by Ivan Cherednik. The main focus is on the r\^ole of these operators in studying integrable many-body systems such as the Calogero-Moser and the Ruijsenaars systems. To put these constructions into a wider context, we indicate their relationship with the theory of the rational Cherednik algebras and double affine Hecke algebras. While we do not include proofs, references to the original research articles are provided, accompanied by brief historical comments.</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Action-Dependent Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action-dependent field theories are systems where the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian depends on new variables that encode the action. After a friendly introduction, we make a quick presentation of a new mathematical framework for action-dependent field theory: multicontact geometry. The formalism is illustrated in a variety of action-dependent Lagrangians, some of which are regular and other singular, that come from some well-known theories whose Lagrangians have been modified to incorporate action-dependent terms. Detailed computations are provided, including the constraint algorithm, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. They include the Klein-Gordon equation, the Bosonic string theory, Metric-affine gravity, Maxwell's electromagnetism, (2+1)-dimensional gravity and Chern-Simons equation, and the heat equation and Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral formula, in which the two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral $\bar S(a,b,c;l_1,l_2)$ depends on positive integer parameters $a,b,c$, $l_1,l_2$ and is an element of the finite field $\mathbb F_p$ with odd prime number $p$ of elements. The formula is motivated by the analogy between multidimensional hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations and polynomial solutions of the same equations reduced modulo $p$.</description>

      <title>Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.
  M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.
  We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy.</description>

      <title>Tilted Solid-On-Solid is liquid: scaling limit of SOS with a potential on a slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid (SOS) model famously exhibits a roughening transition: on an $N\times N$ torus with the height at the origin rooted at $0$, the variance of $h(x)$, the height at $x$, is $O(1)$ at large inverse-temperature $\beta$, vs. $\asymp \log |x|$ at small $\beta$ (as in the Gaussian free field (GFF)). The former--rigidity at large $\beta$--is known for a wide class of $|\nabla\phi|^p$ models ($p=1$ being SOS) yet is believed to fail once the surface is on a slope (tilted boundary conditions). It is conjectured that the slope would destabilize the rigidity and induce the GFF-type behavior of the surface at small $\beta$. The only rigorous result on this is by Sheffield (2005): for these models of integer height functions, if the slope $\theta$ is irrational, then Var$(h(x))\to\infty$ with $|x|$ (with no known quantitative bound).
  We study a family of SOS surfaces at a large enough fixed $\beta$, on an $N\times N$ torus with a nonzero boundary condition slope $\theta$, perturbed by a potential $V$ of strength $\epsilon_\beta$ per site (arbitrarily small). Our main result is (a) the measure on the height gradients $\nabla h$ has a weak limit $\mu_\infty$ as $N\to\infty$; and (b) the scaling limit of a sample from $\mu_\infty$ converges to a full plane GFF. In particular, we recover the asymptotics Var$(h(x))\sim c\log|x|$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a tilted $|\nabla\phi|^p$ model, or a perturbation thereof, where the limit is recovered at large $\beta$. The proof looks at random monotone surfaces that approximate the SOS surface, and shows that (i) these form a weakly interacting dimer model, and (ii) the renormalization framework of Giuliani, Mastropietro and Toninelli (2017) leads to the GFF limit. New ingredients are needed in both parts, including a nontrivial extension of [GMT17] from finite interactions to any long range summable interactions.</description>

Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.08257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we show that the conformal nets corresponding to WZW models are rational, resolving a long-standing open problem. Specifically, we show that the Jones-Wassermann subfactors associated with these models have finite index. This result was first conjectured in the early 90s but had previously only been proven in special cases, beginning with Wassermann's landmark results in type A. The proof relies on a new framework for the systematic comparison of tensor products (a.k.a. `fusion') of conformal net representations with the corresponding tensor product of vertex operator algebra modules. This framework is based on the geometric technique of `bounded localized vertex operators,' which realizes algebras of observables via insertion operators localized in partially thin Riemann surfaces. We obtain a general method for showing that Jones-Wassermann subfactors have finite index, and apply it to additional families of important examples beyond WZW models. We also consider applications to a class of positivity phenomena for VOAs, and use this to outline a program for identifying unitary tensor product theories of VOAs and conformal nets even for badly-behaved models.</description>

Abstract: The hyperbolic Lie algebras with symmetrizable Cartan matrix are classified, there are 142 of them some of which can be ``superized'' to an almost affine Lie superalgebra. We list all 97 pairs (a hyperbolic Lie algebra $H$, its superized almost affine Lie superalgebra $S(H)$). Several (18 of the total 66) superizable hyperbolic Lie algebras have multiple superizations. The tracks of cosmological billiards corresponding to both terms of these pairs ($H\leftrightarrow S(H)$) are the same since the Weyl chambers of $H$ and of $S(H)$ differ only by a~scale.
  We also classified ``superizations'' of hyperbolic Lie algebras with non-symmetrizable Cartan matrix. No interpretations of these Lie (super)algebras are known to us.</description>

Abstract: Geometric quantization is a natural way to construct quantum models starting from classical data. In this work, we start from a symplectic vector space with an inner product and -- using techniques of geometric quantization -- construct the quantum algebra and equip it with a distinguished state. We compare our result with the construction due to Sorkin -- which starts from the same input data -- and show that our distinguished state coincides with the Sorkin-Johnson state. Sorkin's construction was originally applied to the free scalar field over a causal set (locally finite, partially ordered set). Our perspective suggests a natural generalization to less linear examples, such as an interacting field.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Lieb-Thirring bounds</title>

Abstract: We prove upper and lower bounds for the number of eigenvalues of semi-bounded Schr\"odinger operators in all spatial dimensions. As a corollary, we obtain two-sided estimates for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of atomic Hamiltonians with Kato potentials. Instead of being in terms of the potential itself, as in the usual Lieb-Thirring result, the bounds are in terms of the landscape function, also known as the torsion function, which is a solution of $(-\Delta + V +M)u_M =1$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$; here $M\in\mathbb{R}$ is chosen so that the operator is positive. We further prove that the infimum of $(u_M^{-1} - M)$ is a lower bound for the ground state energy $E_0$ and derive a simple iteration scheme converging to $E_0$.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>

      <title>Commutator-based operator splitting for linear port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop high-order splitting methods for linear port-Hamiltonian systems, focusing on preserving their intrinsic structure, particularly the dissipation inequality. Port-Hamiltonian systems are characterized by their ability to describe energy-conserving and dissipative processes, which is essential for the accurate simulation of physical systems. For autonomous systems, we introduce an energy-associated decomposition that exploits the system's energy properties. We present splitting schemes up to order six. In the non-autonomous case, a port-based splitting is employed. This special technique makes it possible to set up methods of arbitrary even order. Both splitting approaches are based on the properties of the commutator and ensure that the numerical schemes not only preserve the structure of the system but also faithfully fulfill the dissipation inequality. The proposed approaches are validated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for almost-minimizers of some nonlocal perturbations of the perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity theorem for almost-minimizers of the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}=P-\gamma P_{\varepsilon}$, where $\gamma\in(0,1)$ and $P_{\varepsilon}$ is a nonlocal energy converging to the perimeter as $\varepsilon$ vanishes. Our theorem provides a criterion for $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity at a point of the boundary which is uniform as the parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$. Since the two terms in the energy are of the same order when $\varepsilon$ is small, we are considering here much stronger nonlocal interactions than those considered in most related works. As a consequence of our regularity result, we obtain that, for $\varepsilon$ small enough, volume-constrained minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}$ are balls. For small $\varepsilon$, this minimization problem corresponds to the large mass regime for a Gamow-type problem where the nonlocal repulsive term is given by an integrable $G$ with sufficiently fast decay at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modifications of Dirac operators in supergravity flux backgrounds are considered. Modified spin curvature operators and squares of modified Dirac operators corresponding to Schr\"odinger-Lichnerowicz-like formulas are obtained for different types of flux modifications. Symmetry operators of modified massless and massive Dirac equations are found in terms of modified Killing-Yano and modified conformal Killing-Yano forms. Extra constraints for symmetry operators in terms of different types of fluxes and modified Killing-Yano forms are determined.</description>

      <title>Analytic Approach for Computation of Topological Number of Integrable Vortex on Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytic method to calculate the vortex number on a torus is constructed, focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss" phenomena occasionally occur.</description>

      <title>Learning PDEs from data on closed surfaces with sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of underlying surface partial differential equation (PDE) from observational data has significant implications across various fields, bridging the gap between theory and observation, enhancing our understanding of complex systems, and providing valuable tools and insights for applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed physical-informed sparse optimization (PIS), for learning surface PDEs. Our approach incorporates both $L_2$ physical-informed model loss and $L_1$ regularization penalty terms in the loss function, enabling the identification of specific physical terms within the surface PDEs. The unknown function and the differential operators on surfaces are approximated by some extrinsic meshless methods. We provide practical demonstrations of the algorithms including linear and nonlinear systems. The numerical experiments on spheres and various other surfaces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simultaneously achieving precise solution prediction and identification of unknown PDEs.</description>

      <title>Locality, Correlations, Information, and non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems generically exhibit breakdown of Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds, motivating study of whether new locality measures might shed light not seen by existing measures. In this paper we extend the standard connected correlation function (CC) to NH systems in a form that recovers locality. Additionally, we use the metric formalism to derive a modified CC which recovers not just locality but even LR bounds in local $PT$-Symmetric systems, and discuss extensions of both CCs to the $n$-partite case. We show that in Hermitian systems $\delta\rho = \rho-\rho_A\otimes\rho_B$ can be written as a linear combination of CCs, allowing us to place an LR bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$. We show this generically extends to an LR bound on mutual information as well. We then extend this to NH systems, where we show its violations can be used to place a necessary condition on which NH Hamiltonians are capable of nonlocal entanglement generation. Numerical simulations are provided by means of exact diagonalization for the NH Transverse-Field Ising Model, demonstrating both breakdown and recovery of LR bounds.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>
