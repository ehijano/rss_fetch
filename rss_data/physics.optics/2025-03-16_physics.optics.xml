      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium Raman Spectroscopy (STERS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new method in cavity- and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with improved temporal resolution in the measurement of stochastic Raman spectral fluctuations. Our approach combines Fourier spectroscopy and photon correlation to decouple the integration time from the temporal resolution. Using statistical optics simulations, we establish the relationship between time resolution and Raman signal strength, revealing that typical Raman spectral fluctuations, commensurate with molecular conformational dynamics, can theoretically be resolved on micro- to millisecond timescales. The method can further extract average single-molecule dynamics from small sub-ensembles, thereby potentially mitigating challenges in achieving strictly single-molecule isolation on SERS substrates.</description>

      <title>Self-calibration in two dimensional aperture mask optical interferometry: a new method for wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new methodology in optical aperture masking interferometry involving Fourier analysis of the complex visibilities (real and imaginary, or amplitude and phase), derived from the interferometric images. The analysis includes use of a non-redundant aperture mask, and self-calibration of the hole-based complex voltage gains to correct for non-uniform illumination and phase fluctuations across the mask. The technique is demonstrated using the Synchrotron Radiation Interferometry (SRI) facility at the ALBA synchrotron light source. Application of the technique results in a joint derivation of the Gaussian shape of the electron beam, and of the hole-based voltage gain amplitude and phase distribution over the mask area. The gain phases are linearly related to the photon path-lengths through the optical system for the ray to each hole, and hence represent an accurate wavefront sensor (WFS) determining the path-length distortions across the wavefront. Wavefront sensing is a vital technology in fields ranging from adaptive optics to metrology to optometry. We calculate that the rms precision of this WFS method is better than 1~nm per frame in the current experiment. We compare the technique to the standard Shack-Hartman WFS. We also show that a structure-agnostic imaging and deconvolution process can be used with the visibility data to determine the beam shape without assuming a Gaussian model, and hence the technique is generalizable to more complex source morphologies.</description>

      <title>Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron ptychography describes a family of algorithms which are used to enable the reconstruction of complex specimen transmission functions of a sample in order to obtain both phase and amplitude information, as applied within the realms of electron microscopy. Ptychographic methods can be very useful in the imaging of beam sensitive materials, samples with both strongly- and weakly-scattering elements, and for mapping the functional properties of materials. Ptychography can further be used to achieve image resolutions far beyond the conventional resolution limit defined by the imaging aperture size. In this article, we review the development of ptychography and compare presently available methods to perform ptychographic image reconstruction on data collected in the (scanning) (transmission) electron microscope. We aim to enable the reader to determine optimal data collection parameters, and the most suitable ptychographic method for the information they seek to determine from their sample.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient PCSEL Design: A Data-Driven Approach for Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven design approach for photonic crystals to achieve high efficiency in photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs). By discretizing the photonic crystal structure into a grid, we enable the generation of arbitrary lattice designs. Multiple fully connected layers combined with a position embedding module extract essential features from the photonic crystal designs, while coupled-wave theory (CWT) is used to evaluate the efficiency based on the ratio of surface-emitting to edge-emitting resonant modes. The model achieves high prediction accuracy, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.88 for SEE and 0.78 for the log-transformed Q. Additionally, we perform Shapley value analysis to identify the most important Fourier coefficients, providing insights into the factors that impact the performance of PCSEL designs. Our work speeds up the design process and offers valuable guidance for optimizing high-performance PCSELs, supporting the development of fully photonic design automation (PDA).</description>

      <title>A Fully Reconfigurable All-Optical Integrated Nonlinear Activator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks have been considered as the promising candidates for next-generation neuromorphic computation, aiming to break both the power consumption wall and processing speed boundary of state-to-date digital computing architectures. Optics has shown its advantages in parallelism and linear manipulation. However, the lack of low-power and high-speed all-optical nonlinear activation neurons limits its revolution in large-scale photonic neural networks. Here we demonstrate an all-optical nonlinear activator (AONA) based on Fano-enhanced nonlinear optical effects in intra-cavity field, in which our device enables reconfigurability both in shape and type of the nonlinear functions (NFs) relying on the tuning biases on Fano interference and cavity buildup. Experimental results show that our AONA enables nonlinear optical computing with low-power continuous-wave light of 0.1 mW threshold, which can also support the overall processing speed of 13 GHz. The performances of the generated reconfigurable NFs are verified in the classification of handwritten digits and image recognition tasks, yielding the converged cost and enhanced accuracy compared to the linear-only networks. Our proposed device would pave the way for energy-efficient and accelerated all-optical intelligent processors with versatile functionalities and large-scale integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel composite polarization controller. With our design, which comprises two half-wave plates and two quarter-wave plates the retardance and rotation can be changed continuously by simply rotating the half-wave plates. The idea is universal since any commercial half and quarter-wave plates may be used to achieve any desired polarization change.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Pre-Sample Photonic-based Free-Electron Modulator in Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial and temporal light modulation is a well-established technology that enables dynamic shaping of the phase and amplitude of optical fields, significantly enhancing the resolution and sensitivity of imaging methods. Translating this capability to electron beams is highly desirable within the framework of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to benefit from the nanometer spatial resolution of these instruments. In this work, we report on the experimental realization of a photonic-based free-electron modulator integrated into the column of two ultrafast TEMs for pre-sample electron-beam shaping. Electron-photon interaction is employed to coherently modulate both the transverse and longitudinal components of the electron wave function, while leveraging dynamically controlled optical fields and tailored design of electron-laser-sample interaction geometry. Using energy- and momentum-resolved electron detection, we successfully reconstruct the shaped electron wave function at the TEM sample plane. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the electron wave function before probing the sample, paving the way for the future development of innovative imaging methods in ultrafast electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum photon-pair source with chiral ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonreciprocity-a fundamental phenomenon enabling directional control of quantum states and photon correlations-has long been recognized as pivotal for quantum technologies. However, the experimental realization of nonreciprocal quantum photon-pair generation, as a critical prerequisite for advancing quantum systems, continues to be an outstanding challenge that remains unaddressed in practice. Here, we experimentally implement a highly-efficient nonreciprocal quantum photon source in a micro/nano-scale helical structured nonlinear optical fluid. Intriguing helical quasi-phase matching is achieved by deliberately engineering the pitch of the chiral ferroelectric structure, thus enabling spontaneous parametric down-conversion with record-high brightness (5,801.6 Hz*mW-1, 10,071% enhancement over phase-mismatched systems) and high coincidence-to-accidental ratio, rivaling state-of-the-art centimeter-scale nonlinear crystals. In particular, by tailoring the ferroelectric helix structure with orthogonally aligned head and tail polarization vectors, we demonstrate up to 22.6 dB isolation in biphoton generation coupled with nonreciprocal quantum polarization states, while maintaining classical optical reciprocity. This quantum liquid-crystal-based platform, combining flexible tunability and superior performance of purely quantum nonreciprocity at micro/nano scales, builds a bridge between a wide range of soft-matter systems, nonreciprocal physics, and emerging quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Direct Nucleation of Hierarchical Nanostructures on Plasmonic Fiber Optics Enables Enhanced SERS Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative fabrication method to achieve bottom-up in situ surface-overstructured Au nanoislands (NIs) with tunable grades of surface coverage, elongation, and branching, directly on micro-optical fibers for sensing applications. These all-in-gold hierarchical nanostructures consist of NIs coated with surface protrusions of various morphologies. They are created in solution using a selective seeded growth approach, whereby additional gold growth is achieved over Au NIs formerly developed on the fiber facet by a solid-state dewetting approach. The morphology of nanosized surface-NI overstructuring can be adjusted from multi-dot-decorated Au NIs to multi-arm-decorated Au NIs. This engineering of optical fibers allows for improved remote surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) molecular detection. By combining solid-state dewetting and wet-chemical approaches, we achieve stable in-contact deposition of surface-overstructured NIs with the optical fiber solid substrate, alongside precise control over branching morphology and anisotropy extent. The fiber optic probes engineered by surface-overstructured NIs exhibit outstanding sensing performance in an instant and through-fiber detection scheme, achieving a remarkable detection limit at 10-7 M for the R6G aqueous solution. These engineered probes demonstrate an improved detection limit by one order of magnitude and enhanced peak prominence compared to devices solely decorated with pristine NIs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical metasurfaces empowered by bound-states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical bound-states in the continuum (BICs) have greatly enriched the field of nonlinear optics with novel ways to control and manipulate light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. This has been made possible by their unique physical properties, including effective confinement of light, non-trivial topological features, and robustness upon the propagation of the optical field both in the real and momentum space. Regarding the exploration of nonlinear optical response in various photonic nanostructures supporting BICs, particular attention has been paid to optical metasurfaces, chiefly due to their ability to control the light flow at subwavelength scale, design and fabrication flexibility, and convenient phase-matching conditions. In this review, we outline and discuss recent advances in metasurface-based frequency conversion processes utilizing the versatile physics of BICs, with a particular emphasis on the main physics background pertaining to nonlinear optical phenomena and optics of BICs, as well as state-of-the-art functionalities enabled by BIC-driven nonlinear metasurfaces. These applications include harmonic generation, harmonic chiroptical effects, generation of complex quantum states, and broadband terahertz generation. In addition, several emerging research fields and the existing challenges of photonic nanodevices relying on BICs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pushing DSP-Free Coherent Interconnect to the Last Inch by Optically Analog Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support the boosting interconnect capacity of the AI-related data centers, novel techniques enabled high-speed and low-cost optics are continuously emerging. When the baud rate approaches 200 GBaud per lane, the bottle-neck of traditional intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) architectures becomes increasingly evident. The simplified coherent solutions are widely discussed and considered as one of the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel coherent architecture based on self-homodyne coherent detection and optically analog signal processing (OASP) is demonstrated. Proved by experiment, the first DSP-free baud-rate sampled 64-GBaud QPSK/16-QAM receptions are achieved, with BERs of 1e-6 and 2e-2, respectively. Even with 1-km fiber link propagation, the BER for QPSK reception remains at 3.6e-6. When an ultra-simple 1-sps SISO filter is utilized, the performance degradation of the proposed scheme is less than 1 dB compared to legacy DSP-based coherent reception. The proposed results pave the way for the ultra-high-speed coherent optical interconnections, offering high power and cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning Based Structured Illumination Microscopy Reconstruction with Light Field Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a pivotal technique for dynamic subcellular imaging in live cells. Conventional SIM reconstruction algorithms depend on accurately estimating the illumination pattern and can introduce artefacts when this estimation is imprecise. Although recent deep learning-based SIM reconstruction methods have improved speed, accuracy, and robustness, they often struggle with out-of-distribution data. To address this limitation, we propose an Awareness-of-Light-field SIM (AL-SIM) reconstruction approach that directly estimates the actual light field to correct for errors arising from data distribution shifts. Through comprehensive experiments on both simulated filament structures and live BSC1 cells, our method demonstrates a 7% reduction in the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and substantially lowers reconstruction artefacts. By minimizing these artefacts and improving overall accuracy, AL-SIM broadens the applicability of SIM for complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Static and Dynamic Disorder: Contrasting Effects on Dark State Population inside a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions between molecules and quantized electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity open up novel possibilities, though inevitably influenced by disorder, an inherent attribute of realistic molecular systems. Here, we explore the steady-state optical response of molecular emitters within a lossy cavity, with a focus on the combined effects of static and dynamic disorder, as frequently observed in solution-phase experiments. By analyzing the transmission spectra, molecular energy change, and dark state population, we uncover the contrasting effects of static and dynamic disorder on the dark state population and its interplay with polariton states. We find that the Rabi splitting exhibits an inversion with increasing disorder strength where the maximum splitting is determined by the interplay of static and dynamic disorder. Furthermore, we identify a dark state-induced polariton linewidth narrowing, revealing a mechanism distinct from motional narrowing induced by frequency fluctuations. These mechanistic insights highlight the critical role of dark states, establishing a foundation for future developments in the fields of polariton chemistry and strong coupling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>On the origin of bulk-related anisotropies in surface optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) is a powerful method for probing the optical properties of surfaces, used routinely in research and industrial applications, yet the origin of 'bulk-related' features that appear in the spectra of various surfaces has been debated for nearly 40 years. It is often argued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy (SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric function. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic effects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the key to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a layer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the origins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified silicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction, the 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the surface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our findings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well with low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation of 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances bulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to, or are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest that previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related' features in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CVQBoost, a novel classification algorithm that leverages early hardware implementing Quantum Computing Inc's Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC) paradigm, Dirac-3 [Nguyen et. al. arXiv:2407.04512]. We apply CVQBoost to a fraud detection test case and benchmark its performance against XGBoost, a widely utilized ML method. Running on Dirac-3, CVQBoost demonstrates a significant runtime advantage over XGBoost, which we evaluate on high-performance hardware comprising up to 48 CPUs and four NVIDIA L4 GPUs using the RAPIDS AI framework. Our results show that CVQBoost maintains competitive accuracy (measured by AUC) while significantly reducing training time, particularly as dataset size and feature complexity increase. To assess scalability, we extend our study to large synthetic datasets ranging from 1M to 70M samples, demonstrating that CVQBoost on Dirac-3 is well-suited for large-scale classification tasks. These findings position CVQBoost as a promising alternative to gradient boosting methods, offering superior scalability and efficiency for high-dimensional ML applications such as fraud detection.</description>

      <title>A spinless crystal for a high-performance solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient 120nm wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.02)\times10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and a multi-photon (more than 2) internal quantum efficiency $p_{\ge 2}=1.0$.</description>

      <title>FLASH{\mu}: Fast Localizing And Sizing of Holographic Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D location and size of microparticles from diffraction images - holograms - is a computationally expensive inverse problem that has traditionally been solved using physics-based reconstruction methods. More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.</description>

      <title>Noise immunity in quantum optical systems through non-Hermitian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth, perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more. For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise. Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to topological descriptions of interacting states of light.</description>

Abstract: Time lenses have been recognized as crucial components for manipulating ultrafast optical pulses in various applications, from ultrafast spectroscopy to interfacing of optical quantum systems. However, the existing analytical model for the electro-optic time lens underutilizes its potential. Here, we introduce a tunable time aperture model for sinusoidal time lenses, enabling precise control over the chirp rate without modifying the device. We derive a closed-form expression for the maximum phase error and demonstrate its dependence on the time aperture. We experimentally validate the model by achieving a 1.6-fold enhanced spectral bandwidth compression of Gaussian pulses compared to the conventional approach. Our framework offers a practical tool for designing efficient temporal optical systems, benefiting applications such as temporal imaging and optical signal processing in both classical and quantum optics, where precise control over spectro-temporal properties is crucial.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution microresonator-frequency-comb spectrometer</title>

Abstract: Spectral analysis is one of the most powerful technologies for studying and understanding matter. As the devices for spectral analysis, spectrometers are widely used in material detection, isotope analysis, trace gas detection, and the study of atomic and molecular hyperfine structures. While high resolution, wide bandwidth and fast speed are essential factors, they are always trade-offs for conventional spectrometers. Here, we present a soliton-microcomb-based spectrometer that overcomes these challenges by integrating dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) with double-sideband modulation and parallelized detection. Leveraging a high-quality silicon nitride microresonator, we generate a broadband, fully stabilized soliton microcomb and employ radio-frequency-modulated double sidebands to scan the optical spectrum with the resolution constrained only by the comb-line linewidth. By projecting the comb lines onto a two-dimensional charge-coupled device (CCD) via a virtually imaged phased array (VIPA)-grating system, we enable parallel processing of all spectral components, circumventing sequential scanning delays. The resulting spectrometer achieves 200-kHz resolution across a 4-THz bandwidth with minutes-level processing time while maintaining robustness against environmental fluctuations. Being promising for miniaturization, this work bridges the gap between laboratory-grade performance and field-deployable practicality, unlocking new possibilities for spectroscopy in astronomy, metrology, and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Stable gigahertz- and mmWave-repetition-rate soliton microcombs on X-cut lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs are a cornerstone of integrated frequency comb technologies, with applications spanning photonic computing, ranging, microwave synthesis, optical communications, and quantum light generation. In nearly all such applications, electro-optic (EO) components play a critical role in generating, monitoring, stabilizing, and modulating the solitons. Towards building photonic integrated circuits for next-generation applications, that will simultaneously maximize system performance and minimize size, weight, and power consumption metrics, achieving soliton microcombs and efficient EO modulation on a chip is essential. X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a leading photonic platform for the realization of high-performance integrated EO devices and systems. However, despite extensive research, soliton microcombs have remained elusive to X-cut TFLN due to its multiple strong Raman-active modes, in-plane refractive index anisotropy, and photorefractive effects. Here, we address this long-standing challenge and demonstrate versatile soliton microcombs on X-cut TFLN, with repetition-rates spanning from the gigahertz (~26 GHz) up to the millimeter-wave (~0.156 THz) regime. The combs feature exceptional long-term stability, maintaining a direct injection-locked state for over 90 minutes (manually terminated), with repetition-rate phase noise closely tracking that of a high-quality electronic microwave synthesizer. Our finding broadly advances both the fundamental science and practical applications of integrated comb sources by enabling efficient EO modulation and broadband coherent solitons to be monolithically combined on the same chip.</description>

Abstract: We report a generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation simulation model of an extreme learning machine (ELM) based on optical fiber propagation. Using handwritten digit classification as a benchmark, we study how accuracy depends on propagation dynamics, as well as parameters governing spectral encoding, readout, and noise. Test accuracies of over 91% and 93% are found for propagation in the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes respectively. Our simulation results also suggest that quantum noise on the input pulses introduces an intrinsic penalty to ELM performance.</description>

Abstract: We designed and built an adjustable repetition rate optical frequency comb using off-the-shelf components with several improvements to an established erbium fiber design. This design, built fully by an undergraduate, was assembled at a fraction of the cost of a commercial comb. This comb has a repetition rate of roughly 100 MHz with a tuning range of 3 MHz. A stabilization control loop for $f_{rep}$ achieved long term drifts of &lt; 1 Hz over several days. This comb will eventually be implemented for use in dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has driven the demand for faster optical components in data centres to unprecedented levels. A key advancement in this field is the integration of multiple photonic components onto a single chip, enhancing the performance of optical transceivers. Here, silicon photonics, benefiting from mature fabrication processes, has gained prominence. The platform combines modulators, switches, photodetectors and low-loss waveguides on a single chip. However, emerging standards like 1600ZR+ potentially exceed the capabilities of silicon-based modulators. To address these limitations, thin-film lithium niobate has been proposed as an alternative to silicon photonics, offering a low voltage-length product and exceptional high-speed modulation properties. More recently, the first demonstrations of thin-film lithium tantalate circuits have emerged, addressing some of the disadvantages of lithium niobate enabling a reduced bias drift and enhanced resistance to optical damage. As such, making it a promising candidate for next-generation photonic platforms. However, a persistent drawback of such platforms is the lithium contamination, which complicates integration with CMOS fabrication processes. Here, we present for the first time the integration of lithium tantalate onto a silicon photonics chip. This integration is achieved without modifying the standard silicon photonics process design kit. Our device achieves low half-wave voltage (3.5 V), low insertion loss (2.9 dB) and high-speed operation (&gt; 70 GHz), paving the way for next-gen applications. By minimising lithium tantalate material use, our approach reduces costs while leveraging existing silicon photonics technology advancements, in particular supporting ultra-fast monolithic germanium photodetectors and established process design kits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a single particle, relaxation into different ground states is governed by fixed branching ratios determined by the transition matrix element and the environment. Here, we show that in many-body open quantum systems the occupation probability of one ground state can be boosted well beyond what is dictated by single-particle branching ratios. Despite the competition, interactions suppress all but the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic where the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove that, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable for any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate model for the dynamics by mapping the evolution onto a fluid continuity equation, and analytically demonstrate that the dominant transition ratio converges to unity as a power law with increasing system size, for any branching ratios. This near-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad applicability. As an example, we discuss a protocol for molecular photoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst, amplifying the yield in a specific final state. Our results open new avenues for many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.</description>
