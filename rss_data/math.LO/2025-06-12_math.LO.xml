      <title>Considerations on Everett J. Nelson's connexive logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores Everett John Nelson's connexive logic, outlined in his PhD thesis and partially summarized in his 1930 paper \emph{Intensional Relations}, which is obtained by extending the system $\mathsf{NL}$ (reconstructed by E. Mares and F. Paoli) with a weak conjunction elimination rule explicitly assumed in the former but not in the latter. After a preliminary analysis of Nelson's philosophical ideas, we provide an algebraic-relational semantics for his logic and we investigate possible extensions thereof which are able to cope with Nelson's ideas with much more accuracy than the original system. For example, we will inquire into extensions whose algebraic-relational models are endowed with irreflexive incompatibility relations, or determine a ``weakly'' transitive entailment. Such an investigation will allow us to establish relationships between some of the trademarks of Nelson's thought and concepts of prominent importance for connexive logic, as e.g. Kapsner's strong connexivity and superconnexivity, as well as between the algebraic-relational semantics of Nelsonian logics and ordered structures that have gained great attention over the past years, namely partially ordered involutive residuate groupoids and (non-orthomodular) orthoposets.</description>

      <title>Growing a Modular Framework for Modal Systems- HOLMS: a HOL Light Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present dissertation introduces the research project on HOLMS (\textbf{HOL} Light Library for \textbf{M}odal \textbf{S}ystems), a growing modular framework for modal reasoning within the HOL Light proof assistant. To provide an accessible introduction to the library, the fundamentals of modal logic are outlined first, followed by a concise manual for the proof assistant itself. The core contribution of this work on HOLMS is the development of a unified and modular strategy for proving adequacy theorems with respect to relational semantics directly within HOL Light for several normal modal systems, currently including K, T, K4, and GL. Adequacy theorems establish a formal connection between syntactic proof systems and their intended relational models, ensuring that derivable statements align with valid ones. This approach extends previous research on G\"odel-L\"ob logic (GL) by two HOLMS developers. It also assesses the generality and compositionality of the completeness proofs in George Boolos' monograph \textit{The logic of provability}. Beyond theoretical contributions, HOLMS incorporates automated decision procedures and a countermodel constructor for K, T, K4, and GL, illustrating how general-purpose proof assistants can be effectively combined with research on labelled sequent calculi and key insights from correspondence and bisimulation theories. The implementation in HOL Light demonstrates the feasibility of mechanising modal reasoning in a flexible and robust manner, paving the way for further developments of the HOLMS framework.</description>

      <title>Notes on applicative matching logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching logic (ML) was developed by Grigore Ro\c{s}u and collaborators as a logic for defining the formal semantics of programming languages and for specifying and reasoning about the behavior of programs. These lecture notes present basic definitions and results on applicative matching logic (AML), a functional variant of ML introduced recently by Xiaohong Chen and Grigore Ro\c{s}u. They can be used as an introductory text in the theory of AML. Monk's textbook on mathematical logic has an enormous influence on the notes.</description>
