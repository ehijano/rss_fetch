      <title>External magnetic field induced paramagnetic squeezing effect in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) encounters the most intense magnetic field ever produced in nature, with a strength of approximately 10$^{19\sim 20}$ Gauss. Recent lattice-QCD calculations reveal that the QGP exhibits paramagnetic properties at high temperatures. When an external strong magnetic field is applied, it generates an anisotropic squeezing force density that competes with pressure gradients resulting from the purely QGP geometric expansion. In this study, we employ (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the paramagnetic squeezing effect of this force density on the anisotropic expansion of QGP in non-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider both up-to-date magnetic susceptibility and various magnetic field profiles in this work. We find that the impact of rapidly decaying magnetic fields is insignificant, while enduring magnetic fields produce a strong force density that diminishes the momentum anisotropy of the QGP by up to 10\% at the intial stage, leaving a visible imprint on the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of final charged particles. Our results provide insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and the dynamics of QGP expansion in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Wobbling motion in triaxial nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental evidence for the collective wobbling motion of triaxial nuclei is reviewed. The classification into transverse and longitudinal in the presence of quasiparticle excitations is discussed. The description by means of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model is discussed in detail.
  The structure of the states is analyzed using the spin-coherent-state and spin-squeezed-state representations of the reduced density matrices of the total and particle angular momenta, which distill the corresponding classical precessional motions. Various approximate solutions of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model are evaluated.
  The microscopic studies of wobbling in the small-amplitude random phase approximation are discussed. Selected studies of wobbling by means of the triaxial projected shell model are presented, which focus on how this microscopic approach removes certain deficiencies of the semi-microscopic quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian mixture model approach to quantifying the empirical nuclear saturation point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) in the limit of infinite symmetric nuclear matter exhibits an equilibrium density, $n_0 \approx 0.16 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, at which the pressure vanishes and the energy per particle attains its minimum, $E_0 \approx -16 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Although not directly measurable, the nuclear saturation point $(n_0,E_0)$ can be extrapolated by density functional theory (DFT), providing tight constraints for microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective field theory (EFT). However, when considering several DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ together, a discrepancy between model classes emerges at high confidence levels that each model prediction's uncertainty cannot explain. How can we leverage these DFT constraints to rigorously benchmark nuclear saturation properties of chiral interactions? To address this question, we present a Bayesian mixture model that combines multiple DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ using an efficient conjugate prior approach. The inferred posterior distribution for the saturation point's mean and covariance matrix follows a Normal-inverse-Wishart class, resulting in posterior predictives in the form of correlated, bivariate $t$-distributions. The DFT uncertainty reports are then used to mix these posteriors using an ordinary Monte Carlo approach. At the 95% credibility level, we estimate $n_0 \approx 0.157 \pm 0.010 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $E_0 \approx -15.97 \pm 0.40 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ for the marginal (univariate) $t$-distributions. Combined with chiral EFT calculations of the pure neutron matter EOS, we obtain bivariate normal distributions for the nuclear symmetry energy and its slope parameter evaluated at $n_0$: $S_v \approx 32.0 \pm 1.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $L\approx 52.6\pm 8.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ (95%), respectively. Our Bayesian framework is publicly available, so practitioners can readily use and extend our results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian uncertainty quantification for synthesizing superheavy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the theoretical prediction power for synthesizing superheavy elements beyond Og, a Bayesian uncertainty quantification method is employed to evaluate the uncertainty of the calculated evaporation residue cross sections (ERCS) for the first time. The key parameters of the dinuclear system (DNS) model, such as the diffusion parameter $\textit{a}$, the damping factor $E_\mathrm{d}$, and the level-density parameter ratio $a_\mathrm{f}/a_\mathrm{n}$ are systematically constrained by the Bayesian analysis of recent ERCS data. One intriguing behavior is shown that the optimal incident energies (OIE) corresponding to the largest ERCS weakly depend on the fission process. We also find that these parameters are strongly correlated and the uncertainty propagation considering the parameters independently is not reasonable. The 2$\sigma$ confidence level of posterior distributions for $a = 0.58_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ fm, $E_\mathrm{d} = 21.9_{-8.6}^{+8.8}$ MeV, and $a_\mathrm{f}/a_\mathrm{n} = 1.044_{-0.059}^{+0.061}$ are obtained. Furthermore, the confidence levels of the ERCS and OIE for synthesizing Z = 119 via the reactions($^{54}\mathrm{Cr}+^{243}\mathrm{Am}$), (${}^{50}\mathrm{Ti}+{}^{249}\mathrm{Bk}$), and (${}^{51}\mathrm{V}+{}^{248}\mathrm{Cm}$) are predicted. This work sets the stage for future analyses to explore the OIE and reaction systems for the synthesis of superheavy elements.</description>

      <title>Study of charge changing and interaction cross sections for 4$\leq$Z$ \leq$9 isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The root-mean-square proton and neutron radii for $^{7,9-12,14}\rm$ Be, $^{10-15,17}\rm$ B, $^{12-19}\rm$ C, $^{14,15,17-22}\rm$ N, $^{16,18-24}\rm$ O, and $^{18-21,23-26}\rm$ F isotopes are deduced from a systematic analysis of experimental charge changing and interaction cross sections in the framework of Glauber model. The calculations involve descriptions of nuclei based on Slater determinants using harmonic oscillator single-particle wave functions. The extracted proton and neutron radii have been examined in the light of some important features such as neutron skin thickness/halo-like structure/subshell closure observed in exotic isotopes.</description>

      <title>An extended NJL model for baryonic matter and quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering baryons as clusters of three quarks, we extend the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to describe baryonic matter, quark matter, and their transitions in a unified manner, where the Dirac sea and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are considered. In particular, a density-dependent structural function $\alpha_S$ is introduced to modulate the four(six)-point interaction strengths to reproduce the baryon masses in vacuum and medium. Vector interactions are considered with the exchange of $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons, where the density-dependent coupling constants are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties as well as the $\Lambda$-hyperon potential depth in nuclear medium. As density increases, quarks will emerge as quasi-free particles and coexist with baryons. This phase is interpreted as quarkyonic matter, where quarks are restricted to the lowest energy states in the presence of baryons, i.e., quarks are still confined. Similar to the treatment of $\alpha$ clustering in nuclear medium, a Pauli blocking term is added to baryon masses so that baryons eventually become unbound in the presence of a quark Fermi Sea. Then at large enough densities baryons vanish and a Mott transition takes place, we consider such a transition as deconfinement phase transition. Depending on the strengths of Pauli blocking term and quark-vector meson couplings, both first-order and continues phase transitions are observed for quarkyonic, chiral, and deconfinement phase transitions. The corresponding compact star structures are then investigated and confronted with various astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability in relativistic viscous and spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have applied thermodynamic stability analysis to derive the stability and causality conditions for conventional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and spin hydrodynamics. We obtain the thermodynamic stability conditions for second-order relativistic hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscous tensors, finding them identical to those derived from linear mode analysis. We then derive the thermodynamic stability conditions for minimal causal extended second-order spin hydrodynamics in canonical form, both with and without viscous tensors. Without viscous tensors, the constraints from thermodynamic stability exactly match those from linear mode analysis. In the presence of viscous tensors, the thermodynamic stability imposes more stringent constraints than those obtained from linear mode analysis. Our results suggest that conditions derived from thermodynamic stability analysis can guarantee both causality and stability in linear mode analysis.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole transition in proton-deuteron radiative capture at BBN energies within potential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $pd$ radiative capture reaction plays a vital role in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and stellar proton-proton chain. The study of the low-energy reaction is challenging in both experiments and theories. Using the framework of potential model, we analyze $pd$ radiative capture below 1 MeV for both electric dipole ($E1$) and magnetic dipole ($M1$) transitions. The obtained astrophysical $S$ factors agree well with recent results, especially at energies relevant to sensitive deuterium abundance. The calculated reaction rate shows good agreement, with less than a 5\% difference compared to recent works. The extrapolated value for $S(0)$ including both transitions is determined to be $0.211 \pm 0.016$ eV b. A comparison with experimental data using the $\chi^2$ test reveals the sensitivity of the $M1$ cross section at low energies to the scattering potential depth.</description>

      <title>Finite size effect on gluon dissociation of J/psi in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal quantities, including the the entropy density and gluon spectrum, of quark matter within a box that is finite in the longitudinal direction are calculated using a bag model. Under the assumption of entropy conservation, the corresponding gluon dissociation rate of J/psi is studied. It reaches a maximum at a certain longitudinal size L_m, below which the suppression is weak even if the temperature becomes higher than that without the finite size effect, and above which the dissociation rate approaches to the thermodynamic limit gradually with increasing longitudinal size of the fireball.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in selected Binary Tree States: Dicke/Total spin states, particle number projected BCS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Tree States (BTS) are states whose decomposition on a quantum register basis formed by a set of qubits can be made sequentially. Such states sometimes appear naturally in many-body systems treated in Fock space when a global symmetry is imposed, like the total spin or particle number symmetries. Examples are the Dicke states, the eigenstates of the total spin for a set of particles having individual spin $1/2$, or states obtained by projecting a BCS states onto particle number, also called projected BCS in small superfluid systems. Starting from a BTS state described on the set of $n$ qubits or orbitals, the entanglement entropy of any subset of $ k$ qubits is analyzed. Specifically, a practical method is developed to access the $k$ qubits/particles von Neumann entanglement entropy of the subsystem of interest. Properties of these entropies are discussed, including scaling properties, upper bounds, or how these entropies correlate with fluctuations. Illustrations are given for the Dicke state and the projected BCS states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lepton-neutron potential in configuration space is obtained. It is based on the Coulomb plus hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian integrated over the neutron charge and magnetic densities. Different parametrisations of the neutron electromagnetic form factors are compared. It is given in the operator form with a central, spin-spin, tensor and spin-orbit terms. The potentials for lowest partial waves states are presented. We compute the lepton-neutron lepton ($ln$) low-energy parameters for the S-waves, estimate the zero-energy cross sections for higher angular momentum states, and point out a possible divergence in the partial wave summation due to the spin-orbit potential.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Determinant Expansions via Transcorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI (FCI) method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. Additionally, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

Abstract: Transverse momentum spectra of identified pions, Kaons , protons and Lambdas produced at mid-rapidity (0 &lt; ycm &lt; 0.5) in p-Pb collisions at root(sNN) = 5.02 TeV is studied for different collision centralities by using a Unified Statistical Thermal Freeze-out Model (USTFM). A fairly good agreement is seen between the calculated results and the experimental data points taken from the ALICE experiment. Kinetic freeze-out conditions are extracted from the fits of the transverse momentum spectra of these hadrons for each centrality class. A comparison of the obtained freeze-out parameters with those of heavy-ion collisions (Pb + Pb) is made and discussed.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound in dense strong-interaction matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the speed of sound in strong-interaction matter at zero temperature and in density regimes which are expected to be governed by the presence of a color-superconducting gap. At (very) high densities, our analysis indicates that the speed of sound approaches its asymptotic value associated with the non-interacting quark gas from below, in agreement with first-principles studies which do not take the presence of a color-superconducting gap into account. Towards lower densities, however, the presence of a gap induces an increase of the speed of sound above its asymptotic value. Importantly, even if gap-induced corrections to the pressure may appear small, we find that derivatives of the gap with respect to the chemical potential can still be sizeable and lead to a qualitative change of the density dependence of the speed of sound. Taking into account constraints on the density dependence of the speed of sound at low densities, our general considerations suggest the existence of a maximum in the speed of sound. Interestingly, we also observe that specific properties of the gap can be related to characteristic properties of the speed of sound which are indirectly constrained by observations.</description>

      <title>Compiled Properties of Nucleonic Matter and Nuclear and Neutron Star Models from Non-Relativistic and Relativistic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compiles the model parameters and zero-temperature properties of an extensive collection of published theoretical nuclear interactions, including 255 non-relativistic (Skyrme-like) forces, 270 relativistic mean field (RMF) and point-coupling (RMF-PC) forces, and 13 Gogny-like forces. This forms the most exhaustive tabulation of model parameters to date. The properties of uniform symmetric matter and pure neutron matter at the saturation density are determined. Symmetry properties found from the second-order term of a Taylor expansion in neutron excess are compared to the energy difference of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density. Selected liquid-droplet model parameters, including the surface tension and surface symmetry energy, are determined for semi-infinite surfaces. Theoretical liquid droplet model neutron skin thicknesses of the neutron-rich closed-shell nuclei $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb are compared to published theoretical Hartree-Fock and experimental results. A similar comparison is made between theoretical liquid-droplet and experimental values of dipole polarizabilities. In addition, radii, binding energies, moments of inertia and tidal deformabilities of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 M$_\odot$ neutron stars are computed. An extensive correlation analysis of bulk matter, nuclear structure, and low-mass neutron star properties is performed and compared to nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Gluon imaging using azimuthal correlations in diffractive scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study coherent diffractive photon and vector meson production in electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions within the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory. We show that electron-photon and electron-vector meson azimuthal angle correlations are sensitive to non-trivial spatial correlations in the gluon distribution of the target, and perform explicit calculations using spatially dependent McLerran-Venugopalan initial color charge configurations coupled to the numerical solution of small $x$ JIMWLK evolution equations. We compute the cross-section differentially in $Q^2$ and $|t|$ and find sizeable anisotropies in the electron-photon and electron-$\mathrm{J}/\psi$ azimuthal correlations ($v_{1,2} \approx 2 - 10 \%$) in electron-proton collisions for the kinematics of the future Electron-Ion Collider. In electron-gold collisions these modulations are found to be significantly smaller ($v_{1,2} &lt;0.1 \%$). We also compute incoherent diffractive production where we find that the azimuthal correlations are sensitive to fluctuations of the gluon distribution in the target.</description>

      <title>Polarized fragmenting jet functions in Inclusive and Exclusive Jet Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a complete theoretical framework for analyzing the distribution of polarized hadrons within jets, with and without measuring the transverse momentum relative to the standard jet axis. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive the factorization and provide the theoretical calculation of both semi-inclusive and exclusive fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) under longitudinal and transverse polarization. With the polarized FJFs, one gains access to a variety of new observables that can be used for extracting both collinear and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). As examples, we provide numerical results for the spin asymmetry $A_{TU,T}^{\cos(\phi _S - \hat{\phi}_{S_h})}$ from polarized semi-inclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at RHIC kinematics, where a transversely polarized quark would lead to the transverse spin of the final-state hadron inside the jet and is thus sensitive to the transversity fragmentation functions. Similarly, another spin asymmetry, $A_{TU, L}^{\cos(\phi _q - \phi _{S})}$ from polarized exclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $ep$ collisions at EIC kinematics would allow us to access the helicity fragmentation functions. These observables demonstrate promising potential in investigating transverse momentum dependent PDFs and FFs and are worthwhile for further measurements.</description>

      <title>First Detailed Calculation of Atmospheric Neutrino Foregrounds to the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background in Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) -- a probe of the core-collapse mechanism and the cosmic star-formation history -- has not been detected, but its discovery may be imminent. A significant obstacle for DSNB detection in Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) is detector backgrounds, especially due to atmospheric neutrinos (more precisely, these are foregrounds), which are not sufficiently understood. We perform the first detailed theoretical calculations of these foregrounds in the range 16--90 MeV in detected electron energy, taking into account several physical and detector effects, quantifying uncertainties, and comparing our predictions to the 15.9 livetime years of pre-gadolinium data from Super-K stages I--IV. We show that our modeling reasonably reproduces this low-energy data as well as the usual high-energy atmospheric-neutrino data. To accelerate progress on detecting the DSNB, we outline key actions to be taken in future theoretical and experimental work. In a forthcoming paper, we use our modeling to detail how low-energy atmospheric-neutrino events register in Super-K and suggest new cuts to reduce their impact.</description>

      <title>Thermal x-ray studies of neutron stars and the equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The understanding of neutron star equation of state hinges on a comprehensive analysis of multi-messenger, multi-wavelength data. The recent scrutiny of PSR J0030+0451 data by NICER introduces complexities, unveiling a tension with another X-ray observation of the central compact object in HESS J1731-347, specifically concerning the mass-radius constraint of low-mass neutron stars. This tension persists when integrating NICER's updated data with LIGO/Virgo's gravitational-wave data from the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. Despite attempts to reconcile these disparate observations, the current combined data still can not distinguish different types of neutron stars -- whether they are pure neutron stars or hybrid stars. Bayesian inference indicates only modest changes in the posterior ranges of parameters related to the nuclear matter and deconfinement phase transition. This ongoing exploration underscores the intricate challenges in precisely characterizing neutron stars. It also points out that it is possible to probe the equation of state at different density regimes from future more accurate radii of neutron stars with various masses.</description>

      <title>Unified equations of state for cold nonaccreting neutron stars with Brussels-Montreal functionals. V. Improved parametrization of the nucleon density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We previously studied the inner crust and the pasta mantle of a neutron star within the 4th-order extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) approach with consistent proton shell corrections added perturbatively via the Strutinsky integral (SI) theorem together with the contribution due to pairing. To speed up the computations and avoid numerical problems, we adopted parametrized nucleon density distributions. However, the errors incurred by the choice of the parametrization are expected to become more significant as the mean baryon number density is increased, especially in the pasta mantle where the differences in the energy per nucleon of the different phases are very small, typically a few keV. To improve the description of these exotic structures, we discuss the important features that a nuclear profile should fulfill and introduce two new parametrizations. Performing calculations using the BSk24 functional, we find that these parametrizations lead to lower ETF energy solutions for all pasta phases than the parametrization we adopted before and more accurately reproduce the exact equilibrium nucleon density distributions obtained from unconstrained variational calculations. Within the ETFSI method, all parametrizations predict the same composition in the region with quasi-spherical clusters. However, the two new parametrizations lead to a different mantle structure at mean baryon densities above about 0.07 fm^-3, at which point lasagna is energetically favored. Interestingly, spherical clusters reappear in the pasta region. The inverted pasta phases such as bucatini and Swiss cheese are still found in the densest region above the core in all cases.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>
