      <title>Milankovi\'c Forcing in Deep Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical (or Milankovi\'c) forcing of the Earth system is key to understanding rhythmic climate change on time scales &gt;~ 10 kyr. Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological applications concerned with past astronomical forcing rely on astronomical calculations (solutions), which represent the backbone of cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology. Here we present state-of-the-art astronomical solutions over the past 3.5 Gyr. Our goal is to provide tuning targets and templates for interpreting deep-time cyclostratigraphic records and designing external forcing functions in climate models. Our approach yields internally consistent orbital and precession-tilt solutions, including fundamental solar system frequencies, orbital eccentricity and inclination, lunar distance, luni-solar precession rate, Earth's obliquity, and climatic precession. Contrary to expectations, we find that the long eccentricity cycle (previously assumed stable and labeled ''metronome'', recent period ~405 kyr), can become unstable on long time scales. Our results reveal episodes during which the long eccentricity cycle is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. For the ratio of eccentricity-to-inclination amplitude modulation (frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide distribution around the recent 2:1 ratio, i.e., the system is not restricted to a 2:1 or 1:1 resonance state. Our computations show that Earth's obliquity was lower and its amplitude (variation around the mean) significantly reduced in the past. We therefore predict weaker climate forcing at obliquity frequencies in deep time and a trend toward reduced obliquity power with age in stratigraphic records. For deep-time stratigraphic and modeling applications, the orbital parameters of our 3.5-Gyr integrations are made available at 400-year resolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of extraterrestrial peptides and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of protein precursors, due to the condensation of atomic carbon under the low-temperature conditions of the molecular phases of the interstellar medium, opens alternative pathways for the origin of life. We perform peptide synthesis under conditions prevailing in space and provide a comprehensive analytic characterization of its products. The application of 13C allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C + CO + NH3 reaction. Here, we address the question of how the efficiency of peptide production is modified by the presence of water molecules. We demonstrate that although water slightly reduces the efficiency of polymerization of aminoketene, it does not prevent the formation of peptides.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Flare Activity in GKM Stars Younger than 300 Myr over Five Years of TESS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are short-duration ($&lt;$ hours) bursts of radiation associated with surface magnetic reconnection events. Stellar magnetic activity generally decreases as a function of both age and Rossby number, $R_0$, a measure of the relative importance of the convective and rotational dynamos. Young stars ($&lt;300$ Myr) have typically been overlooked in population-level flare studies due to challenges with flare-detection methods. Here, we select a sample of stars that are members of 26 nearby moving groups, clusters, or associations with ages $&lt;$300 Myr that have been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite at 2-minute cadence. We identified 26,355 flares originating from 3,157 stars and robustly measure the rotation periods of 1,847 stars. We measure and find the flare frequency distribution (FFD) slope, $\alpha$, saturates for all spectral types at $\alpha \sim -0.5$ and is constant over 300 Myr. Additionally, we find that flare rates for stars $t_\textrm{age} = 50 - 250$ Myr are saturated below $R_0 &lt; 0.14$, which is consistent with other indicators of magnetic activity. We find evidence of annual flare rate variability in eleven stars, potentially correlated with long term stellar activity cycles. Additionally, we cross match our entire sample with GALEX and find no correlation between flare rate and Far- and Near-Ultraviolet flux. Finally, we find the flare rates of planet hosting stars are relatively lower than comparable, larger samples of stars, which may have ramifications for the atmospheric evolution of short-period exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The spectral evolution of white dwarfs: where do we stand?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the dense, burnt-out remnants of the vast majority of stars, condemned to cool over billions of years as they steadily radiate away their residual thermal energy. To first order, their atmosphere is expected to be made purely of hydrogen due to the efficient gravitational settling of heavier elements. However, observations reveal a much more complex situation, as the surface of a white dwarf (1) can be dominated by helium rather than hydrogen, (2) can be polluted by trace chemical species, and (3) can undergo significant composition changes with time. This indicates that various mechanisms of element transport effectively compete against gravitational settling in the stellar envelope. This phenomenon is known as the spectral evolution of white dwarfs and has important implications for Galactic, stellar, and planetary astrophysics. This invited review provides a comprehensive picture of our current understanding of white dwarf spectral evolution. We first describe the latest observational constraints on the variations in atmospheric composition along the cooling sequence, covering both the dominant and trace constituents. We then summarise the predictions of state-of-the-art models of element transport in white dwarfs and assess their ability to explain the observed spectral evolution. Finally, we highlight remaining open questions and suggest avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</description>

      <title>Damping Obliquities of Hot Jupiter Hosts by Resonance Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When orbiting hotter stars, hot Jupiters are often highly inclined relative to their host star equator planes. By contrast, hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are more aligned. Prior attempts to explain this correlation between stellar obliquity and effective temperature have proven problematic. We show how resonance locking -- the coupling of the planet's orbit to a stellar gravity mode (g mode) -- can solve this mystery. Cooler stars with their radiative cores are more likely to be found with g-mode frequencies increased substantially by core hydrogen burning. Strong frequency evolution in resonance lock drives strong tidal evolution; locking to an axisymmetric g mode damps semi-major axes, eccentricities, and as we show for the first time, obliquities. Around cooler stars, hot Jupiters evolve into spin-orbit alignment and may avoid engulfment. Hotter stars lack radiative cores, and therefore preserve congenital spin-orbit misalignments. We focus on resonance locks with axisymmetric modes, supplementing our technical results with simple physical interpretations, and show that non-axisymmetric modes also damp obliquity. Outstanding issues regarding the dissipation of tidally-excited modes and the disabling of resonance locks are discussed quantitatively.</description>
