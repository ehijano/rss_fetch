      <title>Measurement of SiPM Dark Currents and Annealing Recovery for Fluences Expected in ePIC Calorimeters at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) will be used to read out all calorimeters in the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). A thorough characterization of the radiation damage expected for SiPMs under anticipated EIC fluences is essential for accurate simulations, detector design, and effective operational strategies. In this study, we evaluate radiation damage for the specific SiPM models chosen for ePIC across the complete fluence range anticipated at the EIC, $10^8$ to $10^{12}$ 1-MeV $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$ per year, depending on the calorimeter location. The SiPMs were irradiated using a 64 MeV proton beam provided by the University of California, Davis 76" Cyclotron. We measured the SiPM dark-current as a function of fluence and bias voltage and investigated the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing to recover radiation damage. These results provide a comprehensive reference for the design, simulation, and operational planning of all ePIC calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Key Historical Experiments in Hadron Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental observations that led to the quark structure of matter and the development of hadron physics are reviewed with emphasis on the discoveries of mesons and baryons, starting in the 1940s with the pion and kaon which mediate the strong hadronic force. The evidence for an internal structure of the hadrons consisting of two or three elementary spin 1/2 particles is reviewed. The discoveries of hadrons made of the heavier charm and bottom quarks are described. In 2003 more complex multi-quark hadrons began to emerge. The subsequent developments beyond the early 2000s are covered in the Review of Particle Physics (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 030001). Given the very large number of observed hadrons, the choice of key experiments is somewhat subjective.</description>

      <title>Study of event and particle selection effects on elliptic flow background at the isobar experiments based on AMPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) has been a popular topic of high-energy nuclear physics in the last decade. The flow correlation $\gamma$ between charged hadron pairs of the same and opposite charges and their difference $\Delta \gamma$ were measured to separate the CME-driven signal from the collective flow background especially second-order elliptic $v_{2}$. The STAR experiment have stepped further to the isobar experiment to compare $\gamma$ and $\Delta \gamma$ between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr ~\cite{PhysRevC.105.014901}, which were theoretically expected to produce the same elliptic flow background but different CME signals. However, the measured flow backgrounds also differ between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr, indicating more fine-tuning of RP and centrality definition necessary.
  This analysis applied the AMPT model~\cite{PhysRevC.72.064901} to simulate the same collision system and energy as the STAR isobar experiment. Since the AMPT model does not include magnetic field effects, we expect comparing its output between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collision systems can provide an insight of the possible bias of flow background definition, and help improve the measurement of CME signal in real experiments. Multiple combinations of centrality and flow definition were chosen to study how the $v_2$ and their difference would be affected, especially by varying the particles selection of charge versus neutral properties and broadening (pseudo-)rapidity regions, while STAR CME work relied on charged-only particles at central rapidity.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Physics under the low-energy, high intensity frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous achievements and recent progress, nuclear physics is often (wrongly) considered an old field of research nowadays. However, developments in theoretical frameworks and reliable experimental techniques have made the field mature enough to explore many new frontiers. In this regard, extending existing knowledge to an emerging field of physics -- where particles interact with a relatively low-energy but high intensity field (intense enough so that multi-particle processes become comparable or more important than one-to-one processes) -- can lead to exciting discoveries. Investigations can be realized under a highly time-compressed beam source (e.g., particle sources generated by laser-matter interaction using high-power laser systems). Here we focus on a new scheme, where high-power laser systems are exploited as a driver to generate energetic ($\gamma$-ray) photons. Together with additional low-energy photons provided by a second, less intense laser, a multi-photon absorption scheme enables a very attainable manipulation of nuclear transitions including isomer pumping and depletion.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime experiment $\tau$SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).
  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.
  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a probe of hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions that has been experimentally confirmed. In this letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of the quantum entanglement framework in the experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.</description>

      <title>Two- versus three-body approach to femtoscopic hadron-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body approach to hadron-deuteron correlations is shown to turn into a two-body approach if the three-particle hadron-deuteron wave function factorizes into the deuteron wave-function and the wave function of a hadron motion relative to the deuteron. Then, the hadron-deuteron correlation function is as in the two-body approach only the source radius somewhat changes. For this reason, as we argue, the two-body approach works well for kaon-deuteron correlations but it fails for proton-deuteron ones in case of small sources. Applying the three-body approach generalized to the case where the radius of the hadron source is different from the nucleon source radius, we derive the source radius formula which used in the two-body approach gives the correlation function as in the `factorized' three-body one. The formula is discussed in the context of existing and future experimental data.</description>
