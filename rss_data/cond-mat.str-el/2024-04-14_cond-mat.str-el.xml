      <title>High thermoelectric power factor through topological flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) materials are useful for applications such as waste heat harvesting or efficient and targeted cooling. While various strategies towards superior thermoelectrics through a reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity have been developed, a path to enhance the power factor is pressing. Here, we report large power factors up to 5 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ at room temperature in the kagome metal Ni$_3$In$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$. This system is predicted to feature almost dispersionless flat bands in conjunction with highly dispersive Dirac-like bands in its electronic structure around the Fermi energy $E_\text{F}$ [L. Ye et al., Nature Physics 1-5 (2024)]. Within this study, we experimentally and theoretically showcase that tuning this flat band precisely below $E_\text{F}$ by chemical doping $x$ boosts the Seebeck coefficient and power factor, as highly mobile charge carriers scatter into the flat-band states. Our work demonstrates the prospect of engineering extremely flat and highly dispersive bands towards the Fermi energy in kagome metals and introduces topological flat bands as a novel tuning knob for thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum fluctuations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XXZ Heisenberg models on square and honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the XXZ Heisenberg model for spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ systems on square and honeycomb lattices. Utilizing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, complemented by Spiral Boundary Conditions (SBC) for mapping two-dimensional (2D) clusters onto one-dimensional (1D) chains, we meticulously explore the evolution of staggered magnetization and spin gaps across a broad spectrum of easy-axis anisotropies. Our study reveals that, despite the lower site coordination number of honeycomb lattice, which intuitively suggests increased quantum fluctuations in its N\'eel phase compared to the square lattice, the staggered magnetization in the honeycomb structure exhibits only a marginal reduction. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the dependence of staggered magnetization on the XXZ anisotropy $\Delta$, except in close proximity to $\Delta=1$, aligns with series expansion predictions up to the 12th order. Notably, for the $S=1/2$ honeycomb lattice, deviations from the 10th order series expansion predictions near the isotropic Heisenberg limit emphasize the critical influence of quantum fluctuations on the spin excitation in its N\'eel state. Additionally, our findings are numerically consistent with the singular behavior of the spin gap near the isotropic Heisenberg limit as forecasted by spin-wave theory. The successful implementation of SBC marks a methodological advancement, streamlining the computational complexity involved in analyzing 2D models and paving the way for more precise determinations of physical properties in complex lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor and the topological characterization of the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum metric and topological Euler number in a cyclically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with long-range hopping terms. By computing the quantum geometry tensor, we derive exactly expressions for the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the energy band electrons, and we obtain the phase diagram of the model marked by the first Chern number. Furthermore, we also obtain the topological Euler number of the energy band based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the topological characterization of the closed Bloch states manifold in the first Brillouin zone. However, some regions where the Berry curvature is identically zero in the first Brillouin zone results in the degeneracy of the quantum metric, which leads to ill-defined non-integer topological Euler numbers. Nevertheless, the non-integer "Euler number" provides valuable insights and provide an upper bound for absolute values of the Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>(C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$: a metal-organic two-ladder quantum magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets are a versatile materials platform for studying the emergent many-body physics and collective excitations that can arise even in systems with only short-range interactions. Understanding their low-temperature structure and spin Hamiltonian is key to explaining their magnetic properties, including unconventional quantum phases, phase transitions, and excited states. We study the metal-organic coordination compound (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and its deuterated counterpart, which upon its discovery was identified as a candidate two-leg quantum ($S = 1/2$) spin ladder in the strong-leg coupling regime. By growing large single crystals and probing them with both bulk and microscopic techniques, we deduce that two previously unknown structural phase transitions take place between 136 K and 113 K. The low-temperature structure has a monoclinic unit cell giving rise to two inequivalent spin ladders. We further confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 30 mK and discuss the implications of this two-ladder structure for the magnetic properties of (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid pase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized dc conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arise under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>A Microscopic Perspective on Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and of electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in "moir\'e materials", an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir\'e materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems, and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir\'e materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moir\'e ferroelectrics, and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moir\'e materials, but they have also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations and optimization above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows coherent control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as digitized quantum annealing and match the results of a 133-site optimization, where we identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step.</description>

      <title>High temperature transport in the one dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength $U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation functions in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnon-based thermal machine in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic insulators. The thermodynamical cycles are engineered by exposing a magnon spin system to thermal baths at different temperatures and tuning the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find for the Otto cycle that a thermal gas of magnons converts a fraction of heat into energy in the form of work, where the efficiency is maximized for specific values of DM, reaching the corresponding Carnot efficiency. We witness a positive to negative net work transition during the cycle that marks the onset of a refrigerator-like behavior. The work produced by the magnonic heat engine enhances the magnon chemical potential. The last enables a spin accumulation that might result in the pumping of spin currents at the interfaces of metal-magnet heterostructures. Our work opens new possibilities for the efficient leverage of conventional two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Many-body Chaos in the Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of simple operators is essential for the emergence of chaotic dynamics and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have proposed different measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator and Krylov complexity. It is established that the out-of-time-order correlator serves as the signature of quantum many-body chaos, while the Krylov complexity provides its upper bound. However, there exist non-chaotic systems in which Krylov complexity grows exponentially, indicating that the Krylov complexity itself is not a witness of many-body chaos. In this letter, we introduce the missing ingredient, named as the Krylov metric $K_{mn}$, which probes the size of the Krylov basis. We propose that the universal criteria for fast scramblers include (i) the exponential growth of Krylov complexity, (ii) the diagonal elements $K_{nn}\sim n^h$ with $h\in(0,1]$, and (iii) the negligibility of off-diagonal elements $K_{mn}$ with $m\neq n$. We further show that $h=\varkappa / 2\alpha$ is a ratio between the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\varkappa$ and the Krylov exponent $\alpha$. This proposal is supported by both generic arguments and explicit examples, including solvable SYK models, Luttinger Liquids, and many-body localized systems. Our results provide a refined understanding of how chaotic dynamics emerge from the Krylov space perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore higher-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) in the presence of a conformal defect that itself hosts another sub-dimensional defect. We refer to this new kind of conformal defect as the composite defect. We elaborate on the various conformal properties of the composite defect CFTs, including correlation functions, operator expansions, and conformal block expansions. As an example, we present a free O(N) vector model in the presence of a composite defect. Assuming the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) does hold even for the defect systems, we conclude that some boundary conditions can be excluded. Our investigations shed light on the rich phenomenology arising from hierarchical defect structures, paving the way for a deeper understanding of critical phenomena in nature.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area Epitaxy of Bulk-Insulating (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films and Nanowires by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Emulating generator coordinate method with extended eigenvector continuation: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmark study of generator coordinate method (GCM) combined with eigenvector continuation (EC) in two different schemes for the low-lying states of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, where the interaction strength is treated as a controlling parameter, simulating quantum many-body systems with the phase transition from non-collective to collective states. We demonstrate that the EC$_{\rm kmax}$ scheme accurately reproduces the low-lying states of the LMG model. In this scheme, the EC basis consists of the wave functions of low-lying states up to the $k_{\rm max}$-th state of sampling Hamiltonians. Compared to EC$_1$, which only includes the wave functions of the $k$-th state of sampling Hamiltonians for the $k$-th state of a target Hamiltonian, the EC$_{\rm kmax}$ scheme exhibits significantly improved efficiency and accuracy. This study suggests the potential utilization of the extended EC scheme as an efficient emulator for GCM calculations.</description>

      <title>Primary and Secondary Order Parameters in the Fully Frustrated Transverse Field Ising Model on the Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field-theory arguments, we study the fully frustrated (Villain) transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice. We consider a "primary" spin order parameter and a "secondary" dimer order parameter, which both lead to the same phase diagram but detect $Z_8$ and $Z_4$ symmetry, respectively. The spin order scales with conventional exponents, both in the finite temperature critical phase and at the $T = 0$ quantum critical point. The scaling of the dimer order requires more detailed investigations of the applicable low-energy theories; the height model at $T &gt; 0$ and the $O(2)$ model in 2+1 dimensions at $T = 0$. Relating the order parameters to operators in these effective models, we predict the secondary critical exponents and confirm them numerically. The relationships between the primary and secondary order parameters have not been previously discussed in this context and provide insight more broadly for Ising models whose low-energy physics involves dimer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Many-body entanglement and spectral clusters in the extended hard-core bosonic Hatano-Nelson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study many-body entanglements and spectra of the extended bosonic Hatano-Nelson model in the hard-core limit. We show that the system undergoes a phase transition from a gapless phase to a charge density wave phase accompanied by a $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in the first excited state. The phase transition is characterized by the crossing of the ground-state biorthogonal order parameter and the sudden change of the first excited-state entanglement entropy. The gapless phase is verified by the logarithmic scaling of the ground-state entanglement entropy with the central charge $c=1$. Furthermore, we show that all energy spectral clusters would form ellipses in strong nearest-neighbor interactions, for which we establish a universal scaling law. The lengths of the major and minor axes are shown to obey power laws with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction. The exact expressions are derived for the numbers of energy levels on the outermost elliptic ring of each clusters.</description>

      <title>Keldysh crossover in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in pulse laser technology have facilitated the exploration of non-equilibrium spectroscopy of electronic states in the presence of strong electric fields across a broad range of photon energies. The Keldysh crossover serves as an indicator that distinguishes between excitations resulting from photon absorption triggered by near-infrared multicycle pulses and those arising from quantum tunneling induced by terahertz pulses. Using time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group, we investigate the emergence of the Keldysh crossover in a one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator. We find that the Drude weight is proportional to photo-doped doublon density when a pump pulse induces photon absorption. In contrast, the Drude weight is suppressed when a terahertz pulse introduces doublons and holons via quantum tunneling. The suppressed Drude weight accompanies glassy dynamics with suppressed diffusion, which is a consequence of strong correlations and exhibits finite polarization decaying slowly after pulse irradiation. In the quantum tunneling region, entanglement entropy slowly grows logarithmically. These contrasting behaviors between the photon-absorption and quantum tunneling regions are a manifestation of the Keldysh crossover in 1D Mott insulators and provide a novel methodology for designing the localization and symmetry of electronic states called subcycle-pulse engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability of Anomalous Hall Crystals in multilayer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments showing an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have been interpreted in terms of a valley-polarized interaction-induced Chern band. The resulting many-body state can be viewed as an Anomalous Hall Crystal (AHC), with a further coupling to a weak moir\'e potential. We explain the origin of the Chern band and the corresponding AHC in the pentalayer system. To describe the competition between AHC and Wigner Crystal (WC) phases, we propose a simplified low-energy description that predicts the Hartree-Fock phase diagram to good accuracy. This theory can be fruitfully viewed as `superconducting ring' in momentum space, where the emergence of Chern number is analogous to the flux quantization in a Little-Parks experiment. We discuss the possible role of the moir\'e potential, and emphasize that even if in the moir\'e-less limit, the AHC is not favored (beyond Hartree-Fock) over a correlated Fermi liquid, the moir\'e potential will push the system into a `moir\'e-enabled AHC'. We also suggest that there is a range of alignment angles between R5G and hBN where a $C = 2$ insulator may be found at integer filling.</description>

      <title>$\frac{5}{2}$ fractional quantum Hall state in GaAs with Landau level mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau level mixing is the key in understanding the mysterious $5/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs quantum well. Theoretical calculations with and without Landau level mixing show striking differences. However, the way to deal with the considerable strong Landau level mixing in GaAs is still unsatisfactory. We develop a method combining the screening and the perturbation theories to study the nature of the $5/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs efficiently. The screening which has been succeed in explaining ZnO systems integrates out the low-energy Landau levels close to the related Landau level, while the other high-energy Landau levels are integrated out by the perturbation theory. We find that the ground states still hold the quasi-triplet degeneracy which implies the Pfaffian nature of the system. Furthermore, the particle-hole symmetry is only weakly violated since the particle-hole parity is close to unity. We propose that the ground state can be described in form as a superposition of the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states with varied weights depending on the external conditions. In the experimental environment the symmetrized Pfaffian component is dominant, corresponding a thermal conductance around $2.5$ quanta can be understood consequently.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in the two-dimensional dipolar XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment on a square-lattice Rydberg atom array realizing a long-range dipolar XY model [Chen et al., Nature (2023)], we numerically study the model's equilibrium properties. We obtain the phase diagram, critical properties, entropies, variance of the magnetization, and site-resolved correlation functions. We consider both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions and apply quantum Monte Carlo and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group techniques, generalizing the latter to a U(1) symmetric setting. Our simulations perform extensive thermometry for the first time in dipolar Rydberg atom arrays and establish conditions for adiabaticity and thermodynamic equilibrium. On the ferromagnetic side of the experiment, we determine the entropy per particle S/N~0.5, close to the one at the critical temperature, S_c/N = 0.585(15). The simulations suggest the presence of an out-of-equilibrium plateau at large distances in the correlation function, thus motivating future studies on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Rotation of gap nodes in the topological superconductor Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the family of odd-parity topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (CPSBS) has been elucidated to have gap nodes. Although the nodal gap structure has been established by specific-heat and thermal-conductivity measurements, there has been no direct observation of the superconducting gap of CPSBS using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). Here we report the first STS experiments on CPSBS down to 0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface, allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries in the bulk, can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle but crucial role of crystalline symmetry in topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Structural routes to stabilise superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at ambient pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bilayer perovskite La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has recently been found to enter a superconducting state under hydrostatic pressure at temperatures as high as 80 K. The onset of superconductivity is observed concurrent with a structural transition which suggests that superconductivity is inherently related to this specific structure. Here we perform density functional theory based structural relaxation calculations and identify several promising routes to stabilize the crystal structure which hosts the superconducting state at ambient pressure. We find that the structural transition is controlled almost entirely by a reduction of the b-axis lattice constant, which suggests that uniaxial compression along the [010] direction or in-plane biaxial compression are sufficient as tuning parameters to control this transition. Furthermore, we show that increasing the size of the A-site cations can also induce the structural transitions via chemical pressure and identify Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and Ba-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as potential candidates for a high temperature superconducting nickelate at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For QFTs in AdS the boundary correlation functions remain conformal even if the bulk theory has a scale. This allows one to constrain RG flows with numerical conformal bootstrap methods. We apply this idea to flows between two-dimensional CFTs, focusing on deformations of the tricritical and ordinary Ising model. We provide non-perturbative constraints for the boundary correlation functions of these flows and compare them with conformal perturbation theory in the vicinity of the fixed points. We also reproduce a completely general constraint on the sign of the $T\bar T$ deformation in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the experimental relevance of such states by providing a concrete and feasible protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a simple protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) functions.</description>

      <title>Order parameters in quasi-1D spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of what is meant by a meanfield. Meanfields are approximately maps - through some self consistency relation - of a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. This mapping can then be solved to represent properties of the complex many body problem using some self consistency relations. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problems (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models, where there is a 3D system composed of weakly coupled 1D spin chains with the coupling in the transverse direction weaker than in the 1D direction. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising (of any coupling sign) and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. We also consider more exotic models to illustrate other methods of solving 1D systems, namely the $N$-state Potts model. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for all three models, we see that they significantly differ from the usual meanfield estimates. Indeed if the 1D direction has coupling $\Gamma$ and the transverse directions have coupling $J$ with $\lambda\sim\frac{\Gamma}{J}\gg1$ then regular meanfield would predict the transition temperature to be $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\Gamma$ for all three models while 1D meanfield predicts temperatures of $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\log\left(\lambda\right)}$ for the Ising and Potts models and $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Cluster 1D meanfield extensions are also proposed.</description>
