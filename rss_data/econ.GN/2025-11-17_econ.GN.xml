      <title>Assaults on Judicial Independence under the Pretense of Modernization: Evidence from Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how government-orchestrated assaults on the judiciary, disguised as modernization efforts, undermine judicial independence. Our study focuses on Venezuela's constitutional overhaul in the early 2000s, initiated by Hugo Ch\'avez and implemented through a judicial emergency committee. We employ a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of populist attacks on judicial independence trajectories. By comparing Venezuela to a stable pool of countries without radical constitutional changes, our identification strategy isolates the effect of populist assaults from unobservable confounders and common time trends. Our findings reveal that authoritarian interventions lead to an immediate and lasting breakdown of judicial independence. The deterioration in judicial independence vis-\'a-vis the estimated counterfactual is robust to variations in the donor pool composition. It does not appear to be driven by pre-existing judicial changes and withstands numerous temporal and spatial placebo checks across over nine million randomly sequenced donor samples.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Environmental Regulation and Urbanization: a panel data analysis of Chinese prefecture-level cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the Industrial Revolution, the world economy has experienced rapid development, and China's economy has also achieved an unprecedented takeoff in the past. Behind the economic growth, population surge, and continuous improvement of people's living standards lies the enormous consumption of fossil energy and environmental pollution. This kind of pollution has caused irreparable damage to the world. The most concerned environmental issue globally at present is the global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. China is in a stage of rapid development, and as the largest developing country, China's development path has a significant impact on global climate change. At the same time, the global community also puts pressure on China to limit carbon dioxide emissions. To address energy shortages and environmental issues, countries around the world have introduced corresponding energy and environmental regulations. Due to different culture and government systems, the effects of energy and environmental regulations in various countries are also different. Therefore, it is still necessary to discuss China's energy and environmental regulations.This paper uses data from prefecture-level cities between 2003 and 2008 to discuss the impact of the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" environmental regulations on urbanization rates. It first provides a theoretical analysis of the relationship between environmental regulation and urbanization, finding that environmental regulation can influence urban population mobility through both crowding-in and crowding-out effects.</description>

      <title>HSBC until 1950: From its colonial cradle past the World Wars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europe's largest bank by assets as of 2025 started out in the 1860s in one of Europe's colonies: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC). Multiple wars forced Qing China and later the young Republic of China into a series of unequal treaties, one of which was the forced legalisation of the opium trade from parts of the British Empire into China, another was opening several cities, including Shanghai, for trade and granting extensive civil, property and business rights to non-residents and yet another was the annexation of Hong Kong by the United Kingdom. These are the conditions that created HSBC and in which it thrived, including from opium-related profits. During periods of relative calm, the bank grew geographically and made profits -- whether in moral or unethical, whether in legal or unlawful ways -- which helped HSBC weather the storms of civil and world wars. Other aspects contributed to HSBC's survival and success, such as its global nature, which allowed it to diversify and shift away from regions when danger emerges there and find shelter in safer havens. Yet the resilient survival abilities and the financial success of HSBC until 1950 should not distract from the fact that in addition to its tainted cradle and early profits from facilitating the poisoning of a whole society, its human resource system was also discrimination based, attempting to divide the one human race into different groups -- in spite of such practises being opposed to medical and biological facts. What is particularly interesting to see is that not only has HSBC yet to apologise for the early drug-related blood money it made: it even fails to mention its colonial, drug profits tainted past on any of its many history-themed pages sighted. Later sections contain possible reasons for HSBC's resilience and success, particularly interesting for entrepreneurs.</description>

      <title>Seasonality in the U.S. Housing Market: Post-Pandemic Shifts and Regional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonality has traditionally shaped the U.S. housing market, with activity peaking in spring-summer and declining in autumn-winter. However, recent disruptions, particularly post-COVID-19, raise questions about shift in these patterns. This study analyzes housing market date (1991-2024) to examine evolving seasonality and regional heterogeneity. Using Housing Price Index (HPI), inventory and sales data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, seasonal components are extracted via the X-13-ARIMA procedure, and statistical tests assess variations across regions. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in prices and volumes, with recent shifts toward earlier annual peak (March-April) and amplified seasonal effects. Regional variations align with differences in climate and market structure, while prices and sales volumes exhibit in-phase movement, suggesting thick-market momentum behaviour. These findings highlight key implications for policymakers, realtors and investors navigating post-pandemic market dynamics, offering insights into the timing and interpretation of housing market activities.</description>

      <title>AI and Worker Well-Being: Differential Impacts Across Generational Cohorts and Genders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between AI use and worker well-being outcomes such as mental health, job enjoyment, and physical health and safety, using microdata from the OECD AI Surveys across seven countries. The results reveal that AI users are significantly more likely to report improvements across all three outcomes, with effects ranging from 8.9% to 21.3%. However, these benefits vary by generation and gender. Generation Y (1981-1996) shows the strongest gains across all dimensions, while Generation X (1965-1980) reports moderate improvements in mental health and job enjoyment. In contrast, Generation Z (1997-2012) benefits only in job enjoyment. As digital natives already familiar with technology, Gen Z workers may not receive additional gains in mental or physical health from AI, though they still experience increased enjoyment from using it. Baby Boomers (born before 1965) experience limited benefits, as they may not find these tools as engaging or useful. Women report stronger mental health gains, whereas men report greater improvements in physical health. These findings suggest that AI's workplace impact is uneven and shaped by demographic factors, career stage, and the nature of workers' roles.</description>

      <title>Distracting from the Epstein files? Media attention and short-run shifts in Trump's Truth Social posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political "circuses" may undermine democratic accountability if leaders facing scandal can reliably pull media coverage toward fresh topics and away from substantive investigations or evaluations. We investigate whether politicians strategically alter their messaging during damaging media coverage ("strategic diversion") or maintain consistent provocative communication regardless of scandal coverage ("always-on circus"). Using computational text analysis of Donald Trump's Truth Social posts during the 2025 Epstein revelations, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in scandal coverage is associated with communication patterns that deviate from baseline by 0.28 standard deviations over a 4-day window. Although these findings do not provide formal causal identification, they are robust to timing placebos and falsification tests, are consistent with the interpretation that leaders may deploy diversionary communication specifically within their own friendly media ecosystem, which has implications for accountability in polarized democracies.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Investors' Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07630v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate investors voluntary disclosure decisions under uncertainty about their information endowment (Dye 1985). In our model, an investor may receive initial evidence about a target firm. Conditional on learning the initial evidence, the investor may receive additional evidence that helps interpret the initial evidence. The investor takes a position in the firms stock, then voluntarily discloses some or all of their findings, and finally closes their position after the disclosure. We present two main findings. First, the investor will always disclose the initial evidence, even though the market is uncertain about whether the investor possesses such evidence. Second, the investors disclosure strategy of the additional evidence increases stock price volatility: they disclose extreme news and withhold moderate news. Due to the withholding of the additional evidence, misleading disclosure arises as an equilibrium outcome, where the investors report decreases (increases) price despite their news being good (bad). These results remain robust when considering the target firms endogenous response to the investors report.</description>

      <title>Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence from a field experiment across 66 firms and 7,137 knowledge workers. Workers were randomly selected to access a generative AI tool integrated into applications they already used at work for email, meetings, and writing. In the second half of the 6-month experiment, the 80% of treated workers who used this tool spent two fewer hours on email each week and reduced their time working outside of regular hours. Apart from these individual time savings, we do not detect shifts in the quantity or composition of workers' tasks resulting from individual-level AI provision.</description>

      <title>How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an eight-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- appearing only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that, depending on the methodology, exclusive transactions account for between 77.2% and 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Moreover, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully attributed to persistent relationships between senders and builders: only between 7% and 8.4% of all on-chain exclusive transaction value originates from senders who route exclusively to one builder. Finally, we observe that transaction exclusivity is dynamic. Some transactions are exclusive at the start of a bidding cycle but later appear in blocks from multiple builders. Other transactions remain exclusive to a losing builder for two or three cycles before appearing in the public mempool. These transactions are therefore delayed and then exposed to potential attacks.</description>
