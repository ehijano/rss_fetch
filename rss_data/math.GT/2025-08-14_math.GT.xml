      <title>A supergroup series for knot complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a three variable series invariant $F_K (y,z,q)$ for plumbed knot complements associated with a Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)$. The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series.</description>

      <title>The bracket polynomial of the Celtic link shadow $CK_4^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Kauffman bracket polynomial for the shadow of the Celtic link $CK_4^{2n}$ using two complementary approaches. The first approach uses a recursive relation within the Celtic framework of Gross and Tucker, based on diagrammatic identities. The second approach makes use of a 4-tangle algebraic framework: a fundamental tangle is concatenated with itself n times to form an iterated composite tangle, and the Kauffman bracket polynomial is computed by decomposing the state space with respect to the basis elements of the 4-strand diagram monoid.</description>

      <title>Stably exotic 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of closed, smooth $4$-manifolds $M$ and $M'$ are stably exotic if they are stably homeomorphic but not stably diffeomorphic, where stabilisation refers to connected sum with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$. Orientable stable exotica do not exist by a result of Gompf, but Kreck showed that nonorientable examples are plentiful. We investigate which values of the fundamental group $\pi$ and the first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$ and $w_2$ admit stably exotic pairs, providing a complete description if $H_5(\pi;\mathbb{Z})=0$. In particular we produce new stable exotica, and new settings in which they do not arise.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps and framed $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given an element $X$ of the enhanced Teichm\"{u}ller space $\mathcal{T}^\pm(\mathbb{S}, \mathbb{M})$ and a type-preserving framed $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\hat{\rho} = (\rho,\beta)$, there is a $\rho$-equivariant harmonic map $f:\mathbb{H}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^3$ that is asymptotic to the framing $\beta$. Here, the domain is the universal cover of the punctured Riemann surface obtained from a conformal completion of $X$. Moreover, such a harmonic map is unique if one prescribes, in addition, the principal part of the Hopf differential at each puncture. The proof uses the harmonic map heat flow.</description>

      <title>A marking graph for finite-type Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clean markings on surfaces were a key component in Masur and Minsky's hierarchy machinery, which proved to be a powerful tool in the study of mapping class groups. We construct a marking graph for irreducible finite-type Artin groups which is quasi-isometric to the group modulo its center, i.e., an element of $A_{\Gamma}/Z(A_{\Gamma})$ is determined up to finite error by its action on one of our markings. To construct this graph, we construct suitable collections of transverse parabolic subgroups which extend the maximal simplices of the complex of irreducible parabolic subgroups to analogues of clean markings, and we define natural analogues of elementary moves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crochet provides a superior method for the production of two-dimensional surfaces from one-dimensional material. Compared to any of the other known processes to generate constant flat, spherical or hyperbolic shapes, it is the most flexible and precise way to build a dynamical system with very simple local rules and with very high precision of the intrinsic curvature.</description>

      <title>Strongly chiral rational homology spheres with hyperbolic fundamental groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $m\geq0$ and any prime $p\equiv3\ \mathrm{(mod \ 4)}$, we construct strongly chiral rational homology $(4m+3)$-spheres, which have real hyperbolic fundamental groups and only non-zero integral intermediate homology groups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ in degrees $1,2m+1$ and $4m+1$. This gives group theoretic analogues in high dimensions of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic rational homology $3$-spheres, as well as of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic manifolds of any dimension that are not rational homology spheres, which was shown by Weinberger. One of our tools will be $r$-spins. We thus investigate the relationship between the sets of degrees of self-maps of a given manifold and its $r$-spins, and give classes of manifolds for which the sets are equal.</description>

      <title>Large-genus asymptotics of saddle connection Siegel-Veech constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Siegel-Veech constants are powerful tools for counting saddle connections on a translation surface. Their computation can be involved, most famously with recursive formulas that use intricate combinatorics or intersection theory. From these formulas, asymptotics of Siegel-Veech constants for growing genus can be extracted. We extend the known asymptotics to all strata and to all multiplicities of saddle-connections between distinct zeros and of loops.</description>

      <title>The shape of surfaces that contain a great and a small circle through each point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the topological types of surfaces in the 3-dimensional unit sphere that contain both a great and a small circle through each point. In particular, these surfaces are homeomorphic to one of five normal forms and are either the pointwise product of circles in the unit quaternions or contain five concurrent circles. We classify the real singular loci of such surfaces and characterize how circles in the surface meet the self-intersection locus.</description>

      <title>Mirrors of conformal dynamics: Interplay between anti-rational maps, reflection groups, Schwarz reflections, and correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this survey is to present intimate interactions between four branches of conformal dynamics: iterations of anti-rational maps, actions of Kleinian reflection groups, dynamics generated by Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains, and algebraic correspondences. We start with several examples of Schwarz reflections as well as algebraic correspondences obtained by matings between anti-rational maps and reflection groups, and examples of Julia set realizations for limit sets of reflection groups (including classical Apollonian-like gaskets). We follow up these examples with dynamical relations between explicit Schwarz reflection parameter spaces and parameter spaces of anti-rational maps and of reflection groups. These are complemented by a number of general results and illustrations of important technical tools, such as David surgery and straightening techniques. We also collect several analytic applications of the above theory.</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-isotopic unit conormal bundles in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15936v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any compact connected submanifold $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\Lambda_K$ denote its unit conormal bundle, which is a Legendrian submanifold of the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we give examples of pairs $(K_0,K_1)$ of compact connected submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\Lambda_{K_0}$ is not Legendrian isotopic to $\Lambda_{K_1}$, although they cannot be distinguished by classical invariants. Here, $K_1$ is the image of an embedding $\iota_f \colon K_0 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is regular homotopic to the inclusion map of $K_0$ and the codimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is greater than or equal to $4$. As non-classical invariants, we define the strip Legendrian contact homology and a coproduct on it under certain conditions on Legendrian submanifolds. Then, we give a purely topological description of these invariants for $\Lambda_K$ when the codimension of $K$ is greater than or equal to $4$. The main examples $\Lambda_{K_0}$ and $\Lambda_{K_1}$ are distinguished by the coproduct, which is computed by using an idea of string topology.</description>
