      <title>Effect of new healthy and live food supplement on Anemia disease in Wistar rats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anemia is a decrease in hemoglobin and red blood cells and due to a decrease in hemoglobin, oxygen carrying capacity reduce. In this disease, the red blood cell the amount and volume decrease. In this research, healthy and live food powder were synthesized by a green route. This organic biomaterial was named NBS. The NBS healthy and live food powder has various vitamins, macro and micro molecules, and ingredients. Twenty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups, including control and treatment groups 1, 2 and 3. Nutritional supplements for healthy living were administered orally via gavage to rats in groups 1, 2, and 3 at 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ kg, respectively, and within a period of 20 days, one day in between. There was no intervention in the control group in order to reach baseline blood factors. At the end of the study, blood samples were taken from the heart, including blood-red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets using a fully automated blood cell counting machine. The results showed that the new dietary supplement reduced the level of hematocrit and platelets in the studied rats. The healthy and live food supplement at a concentration of 50 mg / kg increased blood levels compared to the control group. The results of this study showed that the use of healthy and live food supplement increased blood factors compared to the control group.</description>

      <title>The role of hydrodynamics in the synchronisation of {\it Chlamydomonas} flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While hydrodynamic coupling has long been considered essential for synchronisation of eukaryotic flagella, recent experiments on the unicellular biflagellate model organism {\it Chlamydomonas} demonstrate that -- at the single cell level -- intracellular mechanical coupling is necessary for coordination. It is therefore unclear what role, if any, hydrodynamic forces actually play in the synchronisation of multiple flagella within individual cells, arguably the building block of large scale coordination. Here we address this question experimentally by transiently blocking hydrodynamic coupling between the two flagella of single {\it Chlamydomonas}. Our results reveal that in wild type cells intracellularly-mediated forces are necessary and sufficient for flagellar synchronisation, with hydrodynamic coupling causing minimal changes in flagellar dynamics. However, fluid-mediated ciliary coupling is responsible for the extended periods of anti-phase synchronisation observed in a mutant with weaker intracellular coupling. At the single-cell level, therefore, flagellar coordination depends on a subtle balance between intracellular and extracellular forces.</description>
