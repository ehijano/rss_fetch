      <title>Finer limit circle/limit point classification for Sturm-Liouville operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an index $\ell_c \in \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace$ which we call the `regularization index' associated to the endpoints, $c\in\{a,b\}$, of nonoscillatory Sturm-Liouville differential expressions with trace class resolvents. This notion extends the limit circle/limit point dichotomy in the sense that $\ell_c~=~0$ at some endpoint if and only if the expression is in the limit circle case. In the limit point case $\ell_c&gt;0$, a natural interpretation in terms of iterated Darboux transforms is provided. We also show stability of the index $\ell_c$ for a suitable class of perturbations, extending earlier work on perturbations of spherical Schr\"odinger operators to the case of general three-coefficient Sturm-Liouville operators. We demonstrate our results by considering a variety of examples including generalized Bessel operators, Jacobi differential operators, and Schr\"odinger operators on the half-line with power potentials.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for ergodic Jacobi operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ergodic Jacobi operators and obtain estimates on the Lebesgue measure and the distance between maximum and minimum points of the spectrum in terms of the Lyapunov exponent. Our proofs are based on results from logarithmic potential theory and their connections with spectral theory of Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces of entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous spaces are de Branges' Hilbert spaces of entire functions with the property that certain weighted rescaling transforms induce isometries of the space into itself. A classical example of a homogeneous space is the Paley-Wiener space of entire functions with exponential type at most a being square integrable on the real axis. Other examples occur in the theory of the Bessel equation. Being homogeneous is a strong property, and one can describe all homogeneous spaces, their structure Hamiltonians, and the measures associated with chains of such spaces, explicitly in terms of powers, logarithms, and confluent hypergeometric functions.
  The theory of homogeneous spaces was in essence settled by L.de Branges in the early 1960's. However, in his work some connections and explicit formulae are not given, some results are stated without a proof, and last but not least a mistake occurs which seemingly remained unnoticed up to the day.
  In this paper we give a detailed account on homogeneous spaces. We provide explicit proofs for all formulae and relations between the mentioned objects, and correct the mentioned mistake.</description>

      <title>A note on the positivity of inverse operators acting on $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive and invertible linear operator $T$ acting on a $C^*$-algebra, we give necessary and sufficient criteria for the inverse operator $T^{-1}$ to be positive, too. Moreover, a simple counterexample shows that $T^{-1}$ need not be positive even if $T$ is unital and its spectrum is contained in the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Structured quantitative almost reducibility and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish \textit{structured quantitative almost reducibility}, tailored for analytic quasiperiodic $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles, which effectively addresses the challenge of infinitely many \textit{normal frequency} resonances. This method paves the way for optimal arithmetic reducibility results for such cocycles, thereby resolving Jitomirskaya's conjecture. From a spectral perspective, it leads to optimal arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic long-range operators on higher-dimensional lattices. In particular, using structured quantitative almost reducibility, we establish a sharp quantitative version of Aubry duality, enabling us to uncover new spectral insights for almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequencies. For example, we precisely determine the exponential decay rate of spectral gaps in non-critical cases, thus addressing a question raised by Goldstein. Additionally, we reveal the optimal asymptotic growth of extended eigenfunctions for subcritical almost Mathieu operators.</description>

      <title>First-order asymptotic perturbation theory for extensions of symmetric operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.00247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work offers a new prospective on asymptotic perturbation theory for varying self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators. Employing symplectic formulation of self-adjointness we obtain a new version of Krein formula for resolvent difference which facilitates asymptotic analysis of resolvent operators via first order expansion for the family of Lagrangian planes associated with perturbed operators. Specifically, we derive a Riccati-type differential equation and the first order asymptotic expansion for resolvents of self-adjoint extensions determined by smooth one-parameter families of Lagrangian planes. This asymptotic perturbation theory yields a symplectic version of the abstract Kato selection theorem and Hadamard-Rellich-type variational formula for slopes of multiple eigenvalue curves bifurcating from an eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator. The latter, in turn, gives a general infinitesimal version of the celebrated formula equating the spectral flow of a path of self-adjoint extensions and the Maslov index of the corresponding path of Lagrangian planes. Applications are given to quantum graphs, periodic Kronig-Penney model, elliptic second order partial differential operators with Robin boundary conditions, and physically relevant heat equations with thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>On the Ground State Energies of Discrete and Semiclassical Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the infimum of the spectrum, or ground state energy (g.s.e.), of a discrete Schr\"odinger operator on $\theta\mathbb{Z}^d$ parameterized by a potential $V:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and a frequency parameter $\theta\in (0,1)$. We relate this g.s.e. to that of a corresponding continuous semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with parameter $\theta$, arising from the same choice of potential. We show that: the discrete g.s.e. is at most the continuous one for continuous periodic $V$ and irrational $\theta$; the opposite inequality holds up to a factor of $1-o(1)$ as $\theta\rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently regular smooth periodic $V$; and the opposite inequality holds up to a constant factor for every bounded $V$ and $\theta$ with the property that discrete and continuous averages of $V$ on fundamental domains of $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ are comparable. Our proofs are elementary and rely on sampling and interpolation to map low-energy functions for the discrete operator on $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ to low-energy functions for the continuous operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and vice versa.</description>
