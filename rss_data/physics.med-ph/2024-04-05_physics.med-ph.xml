      <title>Data harvesting vs data farming: A study of the importance of variation vs sample size in deep learning-based auto-segmentation for breast cancer patients</title>

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in output, when training a model in three different scenarios: a large clinical delineated data set (with 700/78 patients for training/testing, from the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) RT Nation Study), a clinical but curated dataset (with 328/36 patients for training/testing, from the DBCG RT Nation Study) and a smaller, but dedicated data set created by delineation experts (with 123/14 patients for training/testing, consensus delineations created by delineation experts). The model performance was estimated based on the performance metrics dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff 95th percentile (HD95) and mean surface distance (MSD). Models were tested in test sets from their own cohort, and afterwards also compared in the dedicated data test set. The difference between model output was finally estimated by measuring the mean width and cranial caudal length of the model output for the models. When testing the model output between the clinical models and the dedicated models in their own test set, the two clinical models had a poorer performance, than the dedicated models, but not all metrics showed statistically significance. When testing the models in the dedicated data, the dedicated model showed a slightly better performance, along with fewer segmentation outliers. As a way of taking advantage of the strength from both types of data set, it could be an option to use a large clinical data set as a baseline model, and then finetune with smaller sized cohorts with dedicated delineations.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework to Personalize Passive Cardiac Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02807</link>

Abstract: Personalized cardiac mechanics modeling is a powerful tool for understanding the biomechanics of cardiac function in health and disease and assisting in treatment planning. However, current models are limited to using medical images acquired at a single cardiac phase, often limiting their applicability for processing dynamic image acquisitions. This study introduces an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework to estimate the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue using time-dependent medical image data. The iFEA framework relies on a novel nested optimization scheme, in which the outer iterations utilize a traditional optimization method to best approximate material parameters that fit image data, while the inner iterations employ an augmented Sellier's algorithm to estimate the stress-free reference configuration. With a focus on characterizing the passive mechanical behavior, the framework employs structurally based anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive models and physiologically relevant boundary conditions to simulate myocardial mechanics. We use a stabilized variational multiscale formulation for solving the governing nonlinear elastodynamics equations, verified for cardiac mechanics applications. The framework is tested in myocardium models of biventricle and left atrium derived from cardiac phase-resolved computed tomographic (CT) images of a healthy subject and three patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The impact of the choice of optimization methods and other numerical settings, including fiber direction parameters, mesh size, initial parameters for optimization, and perturbations to optimal material parameters, is assessed using a rigorous sensitivity analysis. The performance of the current iFEA is compared against an assumed power-law-based pressure-volume relation, typically used for single-phase image acquisition.</description>
