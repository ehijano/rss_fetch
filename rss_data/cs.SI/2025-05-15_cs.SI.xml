      <title>Visibility and Influence in Digital Social Relations: Towards a New Symbolic Capital?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics of visibility and influence in digital social relations, examining their implications for the emergence of a new symbolic capital. Using a mixedmethods design, the research combined semi-structured interviews with 20 digitally active individuals and quantitative social media data analysis to identify key predictors of digital symbolic capital. Findings reveal that visibility is influenced by content quality, network size, and engagement strategies, while influence depends on credibility, authority, and trust. The study identifies a new form of symbolic capital based on online visibility, influence, and reputation, distinct from traditional forms. The research discusses the ethical implications of these dynamics and suggests future research directions, emphasizing the need to update social theories to account for digital transformations.</description>

      <title>SALM: A Multi-Agent Framework for Language Model-Driven Social Network Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2) an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%, 82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks, we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity.</description>

      <title>Spatial public goods games with queueing and reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world social and economic systems, the provisioning of public goods generally entails continuous interactions among individuals, with decisions to cooperate or defect being influenced by dynamic factors such as timing, resource availability, and the duration of engagement. However, the traditional public goods game ignores the asynchrony of the strategy adopted by players in the game. To address this problem, we propose a spatial public goods game that integrates an M/M/1 queueing system to simulate the dynamic flow of player interactions. We use a birth-death process to characterize the stochastic dynamics of this queueing system, with players arriving following a Poisson process and service times being exponentially distributed under a first-come-first-served basis with finite queue capacity. We also incorporate reputation so that players who have cooperated in the past are more likely to be chosen for future interactions. Our research shows that a high arrival rate, low service rate, and the reputation mechanism jointly facilitate the emergence of cooperative individuals in the network, which thus provides an interesting and new perspective for the provisioning of public goods.</description>

      <title>Moving towards informative and actionable social media research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is nearly ubiquitous in modern life, and concerns have been raised about its putative societal impacts, ranging from undermining mental health and exacerbating polarization to fomenting violence and disrupting democracy. Despite extensive research, consensus on these effects remains elusive, with observational studies often highlighting concerns while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yield conflicting or null findings. This review examines how the complexity inherent in social systems can account for such discrepancies, emphasizing that emergent societal and long-term outcomes cannot be readily inferred from individual-level effects. In complex systems, such as social networks, feedback loops, hysteresis, multi-scale dynamics, and non-linearity limit the utility of approaches for assessing causality that are otherwise robust in simpler contexts. Revisiting large-scale experiments, we explore how null or conflicting findings may reflect these complexities rather than a true absence of effects. Even in cases where the methods are appropriate, assessing the net impacts of social media provides little actionable insight given that eliminating social media is not a realistic option for whole populations. We argue that progress will require a complexity-minded approach focused on specific design choices of online platforms that triangulates experimental, observational and theoretical methods.</description>

      <title>The Niche Connectivity Paradox: Multichrome Contagions Overcome Vaccine Hesitancy more effectively than Monochromacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of vaccine hesitancy has caused a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, alongside widespread skepticism and refusals of COVID-19 vaccinations. While categorizing individuals as either supportive of or opposed to vaccines provides a convenient dichotomy of vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy is far more complex and dynamic. It involves wavering individuals whose attitudes fluctuate -- those who may exhibit pro-vaccine attitudes at one time and anti-vaccine attitudes at another. Here, we identify and analyze multichrome contagions as potential targets for intervention by leveraging a dataset of known pro-vax and anti-vax Twitter users ($n =135$ million) and a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset ($n = 3.5$ billion; including close analysis of $1,563,472$ unique individuals). We reconstruct an evolving multiplex sentiment landscape using top co-spreading issues, characterizing them as monochrome and multichrome contagions, based on their conceptual overlap with vaccination. We demonstrate switchers as deliberative: they are more moderate, engage with a wider range of topics, and occupy more central positions in their networks. Further examination of their information consumption shows that their discourse often engages with progressive issues such as climate change, which can serve as avenues for multichrome contagion interventions to promote pro-vaccine attitudes. Using data-driven intervention simulations, we demonstrate a paradox of niche connectivity, where multichrome contagions with fragmented, non-overlapping communities generate the highest levels of diffusion for pro-vaccine attitudes. Our work offers insights into harnessing synergistic hitchhiking effect of multichrome contagions to drive desired attitude and behavior changes in network-based interventions, particularly for overcoming vaccine hesitancy.</description>

      <title>DyGSSM: Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the dynamic graph representation learning methods involve dividing a dynamic graph into discrete snapshots to capture the evolving behavior of nodes over time. Existing methods primarily capture only local or global structures of each node within a snapshot using message-passing and random walk-based methods. Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to encode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques to update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations. First, they neglect the extraction of global and local information simultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's performance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a lack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to optimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address the aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we propose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM). Our approach combines Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) for local feature extraction and random walk with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for global feature extraction in each snapshot. We then integrate the local and global features using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate an SSM based on HiPPO algorithm to account for long-term dependencies when updating model parameters, ensuring that model performance in each snapshot informs subsequent updates. Experiments on five public datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 17 out of 20 cases.</description>

      <title>Instant AoI Optimization through Relay Location Selection in Disaster Multi-hop Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorological disasters such as typhoons, forest fires, and floods can damage the communication infrastructures, which will further disable the communication capabilities of cellular networks. The multi-hop wireless communication based on IoT devices (e.g., rescue robots, UAVs, and mobile devices) becomes an available and rapidly deployable communication approach for search and rescue operations. However, Age of Information (AoI), an emerging network performance metric, has not been comprehensively investigated in this multi-hop model. In this paper, we first construct a UAV-relayed wireless network model and formulate the end-to-end instant AoI. Then we derive the optimal location of the relay UAV to achieve the minimum instant AoI by mathematical analysis. Simulations show that the derived relay location can always guarantee the optimal AoI and outperform other schemes.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Detection Based on Z-Score And Neighbor Table Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormhole attacks can cause serious disruptions to the network topology in disaster rescue opportunity networks.
  By establishing false Wormhole(WH) links, malicious nodes can mislead legitimate paths in the network, further causing serious consequences such as traffic analysis attacks (i.e., by eavesdropping and monitoring exchanged traffic), denial of service (DoS) or selective packet loss attacks. This paper uses rescue equipment (vehicle-mounted base stations, rescue control centers, etc.) as an effective third-party auditor (TPA), and combines the commonly used Z-Score (Standard Score) data processing method to propose a new detection method based on pure mathematical statistics for detecting wormhole attacks. Finally, we perform a large number of simulations to evaluate the proposed method. Since our proposed strategy does not require auxiliary equipment such as GPS positioning and timers, as a pure data statistical analysis method, it is obviously more economically valuable, feasible, and practical than other strategies in disaster relief.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Optimal Approximation Algorithm for Multiobjective Submodular Maximization at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09525v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing a single submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint is a well-studied and central topic in combinatorial optimization. However, finding a set that maximizes multiple functions at the same time is much less understood, even though it is a formulation which naturally occurs in robust maximization or problems with fairness considerations such as fair influence maximization or fair allocation.
  In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum over many submodular functions, which is known as multiobjective submodular maximization. All known polynomial-time approximation algorithms either obtain a weak approximation guarantee or rely on the evaluation of the multilinear extension. The latter is expensive to evaluate and renders such algorithms impractical. We bridge this gap and introduce the first scalable and practical algorithm that obtains the best-known approximation guarantee. We furthermore introduce a novel application fair centrality maximization and show how it can be addressed via multiobjective submodular maximization. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm outperforms known algorithms in terms of objective value and running time.</description>

      <title>The Susceptibility Paradox in Online Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding susceptibility to online influence is crucial for mitigating the spread of misinformation and protecting vulnerable audiences. This paper investigates susceptibility to influence within social networks, focusing on the differential effects of influence-driven versus spontaneous behaviors on user content adoption. Our analysis reveals that influence-driven adoption exhibits high homophily, indicating that individuals prone to influence often connect with similarly susceptible peers, thereby reinforcing peer influence dynamics, whereas spontaneous adoption shows significant but lower homophily. Additionally, we extend the Generalized Friendship Paradox to influence-driven behaviors, demonstrating that users' friends are generally more susceptible to influence than the users themselves, de facto establishing the notion of Susceptibility Paradox in online social influence. This pattern does not hold for spontaneous behaviors, where friends exhibit fewer spontaneous adoptions. We find that susceptibility to influence can be predicted using friends' susceptibility alone, while predicting spontaneous adoption requires additional features, such as user metadata. These findings highlight the complex interplay between user engagement and characteristics in spontaneous content adoption. Our results provide new insights into social influence mechanisms and offer implications for designing more effective moderation strategies to protect vulnerable audiences.</description>

      <title>Degree Matrix Comparison for Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph alignment problem, which considers the optimal node correspondence across networks, has recently gained significant attention due to its wide applications. There are graph alignment methods suited for various network types, but we focus on the unsupervised geometric alignment algorithms. We propose Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC), a very simple degree-based method that has shown to be effective for heterogeneous networks. Through extensive experiments and mathematical proofs, we demonstrate the potential of this method. Remarkably, DMC achieves up to 99% correct node alignment for 90%-overlap networks and 100% accuracy for isomorphic graphs. Additionally, we propose a reduced Greedy DMC with lower time complexity and Weighted DMC that has demonstrated potential for aligning weighted graphs. Positive results from applying Greedy DMC and the Weighted DMC furthermore speaks to the validity and potential of the DMC. The sequence of DMC methods could significantly impact graph alignment, offering reliable solutions for the task.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Politics: Prevalence, Spreaders, and Emotional Reception of AI-Generated Political Images on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite widespread concerns about the risks of AI-generated content (AIGC) to the integrity of social media discourse, little is known about its scale and scope, the actors responsible for its dissemination online, and the user responses it elicits. In this work, we measure and characterize the prevalence, spreaders, and emotional reception of AI-generated political images. Analyzing a large-scale dataset from Twitter/X related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we find that approximately 12% of shared images are detected as AI-generated, and around 10% of users are responsible for sharing 80% of AI-generated images. AIGC superspreaders--defined as the users who not only share a high volume of AI-generated images but also receive substantial engagement through retweets--are more likely to be X Premium subscribers, have a right-leaning orientation, and exhibit automated behavior. Their profiles contain a higher proportion of AI-generated images than non-superspreaders, and some engage in extreme levels of AIGC sharing. Moreover, superspreaders' AI image tweets elicit more positive and less toxic responses than their non-AI image tweets. This study serves as one of the first steps toward understanding the role generative AI plays in shaping online socio-political environments and offers implications for platform governance.</description>

      <title>Local Differential Privacy-Preserving Spectral Clustering for General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is a widely used algorithm to find clusters in networks. Several researchers have studied the stability of spectral clustering under local differential privacy with the additional assumption that the underlying networks are generated from the stochastic block model (SBM). However, we argue that this assumption is too restrictive since social networks do not originate from the SBM. Thus, we delve into an analysis for general graphs in this work. Our primary focus is the edge flipping method -- a common technique for protecting local differential privacy. We show that, when the edges of an $n$-vertex graph satisfying some reasonable well-clustering assumptions are flipped with a probability of $O(\log n/n)$, the clustering outcomes are largely consistent. Empirical tests further corroborate these theoretical findings. Conversely, although clustering outcomes have been stable for non-sparse and well-clustered graphs produced from the SBM, we show that in general, spectral clustering may yield highly erratic results on certain well-clustered graphs when the flipping probability is $\omega(\log n/n)$. This indicates that the best privacy budget obtainable for general graphs is $\Theta(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Emotion Framework of Rumour Threads on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rumours in online social media pose significant risks to modern society, motivating the need for better understanding of how they develop. We focus specifically on the interface between emotion and rumours in threaded discourses, building on the surprisingly sparse literature on the topic which has largely focused on single aspect of emotions within the original rumour posts themselves, and largely overlooked the comparative differences between rumours and non-rumours. In this work, we take one step further to provide a comprehensive analytical emotion framework with multi-aspect emotion detection, contrasting rumour and non-rumour threads and provide both correlation and causal analysis of emotions. We applied our framework on existing widely-used rumour datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics in online social media threads. Our framework reveals that rumours trigger more negative emotions (e.g., anger, fear, pessimism), while non-rumours evoke more positive ones. Emotions are contagious, rumours spread negativity, non-rumours spread positivity. Causal analysis shows surprise bridges rumours and other emotions; pessimism comes from sadness and fear, while optimism arises from joy and love.</description>
