      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of EMD-AdS black hole with deformed horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the horizon shapes of static Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) black holes can be deformed through an approach analogous to those observed in novel topological black hole solutions supported by two massless axion fields. Particularly, the radial part of the spacetime remains unchanged, while the angular part has a non-constant Ricci scalar, signaling the presence of anisotropy. We further explore the implications of this anisotropy for the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. The validity of the Misner-Sharp (MS) mass and the unified first law are also addressed in this study.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases from the exclusion of higher harmonics in parameter estimation on LISA binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely infer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the accuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the systematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform templates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an important consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to be observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with different total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that systematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with total redshifted mass $\gtrsim10^6\,M_\odot$. We then compare several methods of predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian parameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood optimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct approximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\ell\geq5$ to better understand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current approximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the MBHB signals detected by LISA.</description>

      <title>Weighing the curvature invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities, as well as asymptotic properties of spacetimes. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors, independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often stated in the physics literature that maximally-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes are characterized by near-horizon co-rotating circular geodesics of radius $r_{\text{circular}}$ with the property $r_{\text{circular}}\to r^+_{\text{H}}$, where $r_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the extremal black hole. Based on the famous Thorne hoop conjecture, in the present compact paper we provide evidence for the existence of a non-trivial lower bound ${{r_{\text{circular}}-r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\gtrsim (\mu/M)^{1/2}$ on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime, where $\mu/M$ is the dimensionless mass ratio which characterizes the composed black-hole-orbiting-particle system.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of the spin curvatures that arise in the framework of the Infeld-van der Waerden {\epsilon}-formalism for general relativity is presented. The sourceful extension formulated in an earlier work of the theory of gravitons in vacuum is then reviewed in a concise way. At this stage the {\epsilon}-formalism system of gravitational wave equations obtained thereabout is replicated on the basis of the implementation of the same calculational techniques as the ones that had been utilized in the sourceless situation. An important symmetry property borne by the right-hand sides of those wave equations is subsequently brought forward.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Coupling Regime in Dilatonic $f(R,T)$ Inflationary Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we study cosmology in dilatonic $f(R,T)$ gravity to address the inflationary phase of the early Universe. As usual, in dilatonic gravity the scalar potential assumes the exponential form. However, this potential is not good enough to be in accord with the Planck 2018 data. More strikingly, the generalized $\beta$-exponential cannot take this into account either. It is just the presence of the dilatonic sector, in the intermediate coupling regime, that can help the theory to be in full accord with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Probing Chaos in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: The Role of Black Hole and Cosmological Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of a massless, chargeless particle in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, revealing exponential radial growth and potential chaos in an integrable system. Poincar\'e sections show regular Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori when black hole and cosmological horizons are distant, but distortions and chaos emerge as they converge. As the horizons coincide, the Poincar\'e sections fully contract and vanish, marking the system's transition to Nariai spacetime. \textit{Our analysis also suggests that, within the parameter range explored, the event horizon exerts a comparatively more substantial chaotic influence on the system, primarily due to its consistent proximity.} Additionally, we analyze the Lyapunov exponents to quantify the degree of chaos in the system. Our findings indicate that as the closeness of the two horizons increases, the most prominent Lyapunov exponent also increases, signifying a rise in chaotic behavior. By examining the long-term saturation values of the Lyapunov exponents, we confirm that they consistently comply with the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound.</description>

      <title>Late-time behaviors of scalar field modes for a collapsing null shell spacetime and for the Unruh state in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviors of the modes for a massless minimally coupled scalar field are investigated for the Unruh state for Schwarzschild spacetime and the "in" vacuum state for a spacetime in which a spherically symmetric null shell collapses to form a nonrotating black hole. In both cases there are two different sets of solutions to the mode equation that make up the state. For both spacetimes, one set of modes oscillates forever with no damping of the oscillations and the other set approaches zero at late times. The difference between a mode that oscillates forever in the null-shell spacetime and the corresponding mode for the Unruh state vanishes as a power law in time. The modes that approach zero at late times also vanish at late times as a power law in time. In all cases the power-law damping is preceded by a period of oscillations that appear to be due to quasi-normal modes.</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and of the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safety, quantum gravity, and the swampland: a conceptual assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a conceptual assessment of some aspects of fundamental quantum field theories of gravity in light of foundational aspects of the swampland program. On the one hand, asymptotically safe quantum gravity may provide a simple and predictive framework, thanks to a finite number of relevant parameters. On the other hand, a (sub-)set of intertwined swampland conjectures on the consistency of quantum gravity can be argued to be universal via effective field theory considerations. We answer whether some foundational features of these frameworks are compatible. This involves revisiting and refining several arguments (and loopholes) concerning the relation between field-theoretic descriptions of gravity and general swampland ideas. We identify the thermodynamics of black holes, spacetime topology change, and holography as the core aspects of this relation. We draw lessons on the features that a field theoretic description of gravity must (not) have to be consistent with fundamental principles underlying the swampland program, and on the universality of the latter.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Chemistry Knows Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables. In addition, we discuss the zeroth-order phase transition of the 4-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface: Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes using a geometric Hamiltonian approach to the Schr\"odinger-like representation. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools.
  The mathematical aspects of Gaussian integration theory in infinite-dimensional Topological Vector Spaces (TVS) are thoroughly reviewed. It also reviews the complex and holomorphic versions of important results and concepts of Gaussian integration. For example, the Wiener-It\^o decomposition theorem or the definition of Hida test functions.
  The physical framework builds upon three interconnected levels: classical General Relativity (GR), Classical Statistical Field Theory (CSFT), and QFT. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove (KvH) formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. This description is based upon prequantization theory. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.
  Upon the prequantum program, the QFT of the scalar field is built mixing Geometric Quantization with the choice of Wick and Weyl orderings. Various quantum representations are introduced: the holomorphic, Schr\"odinger, field-momentum, and antiholomorphic. The relation among them is studied using integral transforms, including novel infinite-dimensional Fourier transforms. From a geometrical analysis, it is argued that a covariant time derivative that modifies the evolution equations should be added to the Schr\"odinger equation. This connection is unique and required by the geometrodynamical description ofthe coupling of QFT and GR.
  Finally, studying the free model on cosmological spacetimes it obtains particle creation effects on a dynamical equation.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings between dynamical dark energy (DDE), interacting dark energy (IDE), and running vacuum (RV). In our approach, the dark sector functions that characterize each model-such as the equation of state parameter $\bar{w}(a)$ for DDE, the interaction term $Q$ for IDE, and the functional form $\Lambda(H)$ for RV-are transformed into one another under specific assumptions. Extending previous work by von Marttens et al., we demonstrate that running vacuum models, characterized by $\Lambda(H) = a_0 + a_1 \dot{H} + a_2 H^2$, can be reinterpreted as an interacting dark energy model with $Q = 3H\gamma \hat{\rho}_c$, which in turn is equivalent to a dynamic dark energy model with an appropriately defined $\bar{w}(a)$. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in dark energy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Probing curved spacetime with a distributed atomic processor clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics on curved spacetime has never been directly probed beyond the Newtonian limit. Although we can describe such dynamics theoretically, experiments would provide empirical evidence that quantum theory holds even in this extreme limit. The practical challenge is the minute spacetime curvature difference over the length scale of the typical extent of quantum effects. Here we propose a quantum network of alkaline earth(-like) atomic processors for constructing a distributed quantum state that is sensitive to the differential proper time between its constituent atomic processor nodes, implementing a quantum observable that is affected by post-Newtonian curved spacetime. Conceptually, we delocalize one clock between three locations by encoding the presence or absence of a clock into the state of the local atoms. By separating three atomic nodes over $\sim$km-scale elevation differences and distributing one clock between them via a W-state, we demonstrate that the curvature of spacetime is manifest in the interference of the three different proper times that give rise to three distinct beat notes in our non-local observable. We further demonstrate that $N$-atom entanglement within each node enhances the interrogation bandwidth by a factor of $N$. We discuss how our system can probe new facets of fundamental physics, such as the linearity, unitarity and probabilistic nature of quantum theory on curved spacetime. Our protocol combines several recent advances with neutral atom and trapped ions to realize a novel quantum probe of curved spacetime uniquely enabled by quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in that patch, with the associated Einstein conditions, of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$, being used as independent loss components; in our conventions, $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold and $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$. To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $ g' = J g J^T$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented with 2 patches in dimensions $2,3,4,5$; in dimensions $2, 3$ the geometries have been fully classified, however it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can be put on spheres in dimensions $4, 5$, which we provide numerical evidence against.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of spinning, eccentric binary black holes at 1.5 post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The closed-form solution of the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) accurate binary black hole (BBH) Hamiltonian system has proven to be difficult to obtain for a long time since its introduction in 1966. Closed-form solutions of the PN BBH systems with arbitrary parameters (masses, spins, eccentricity) are required for modeling the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by them. Accurate models of GWs are crucial for their detection by LIGO/Virgo and LISA. Only recently, two solution methods for solving the BBH dynamics were proposed in arXiv:1908.02927 (without using action-angle variables), and arXiv:2012.06586, arXiv:2110.15351 (action-angle based). This paper combines the ideas laid out in the above articles, fills the missing gaps and provides the two solutions which are fully 1.5PN accurate. We also present a public Mathematica package BBHpnToolkit which implements these two solutions and compares them with a fully numerical treatment. The level of agreement between these solutions provides a numerical verification for all the five actions constructed in arXiv:2012.06586, and arXiv:2110.15351. This paper hence serves as a stepping stone for pushing the action-angle-based solution to 2PN order via canonical perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of de Sitter from the anti de Sitter spacetime in scalar field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of Einstein-scalar gravity, the gravitational coupling can drive the nucleation of the de Sitter (dS) spacetime from an anti de Sitter (AdS) one. This is done using a static and spherically-symmetric metastable scalar lump solution. This features an $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime in the solution's core, allows for $\text{dS}_4$ vacua and is plagued by a tachyonic instability. Using the Euclidean action formalism in the semiclassical approximation, we compute and compare the probability amplitudes and the free energies of the $\text{AdS}_{4}$ lump and the $\text{dS}_4$ vacua. Our results show that the former is generally less favored than the latter, with the most preferred state being a $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. Thus, we interpret the lump as a metastable state which mediates the decay of the $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime into the true $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. We argue that this nucleation mechanism of dS spacetime may provide insights into the short-distance behavior of gravity, in particular for the characterization of supergravity vacua, cosmological inflation and the black-hole singularity problem.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories of gravity from a thermodynamic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity, one can define a Noether charge arising from the invariance of the Lagrangian under diffeomorphisms. We have determined the Noether charge for scalar-tensor theories of gravity, in which case the gravity is mediated by the metric tensor as well as by a scalar degree of freedom. In particular, we demonstrate that the total Noether charge within an appropriate spatial volume can be related to the heat content of the boundary surface. For static spacetimes, in these theories, there exist an ``equipartition" between properly defined bulk and surface degrees of freedom. While the dynamical evolution of spacetime in these theories of scalar-tensor gravity arises due to the departure from the equipartition regime. These results demonstrate that thermodynamical interpretations for gravitational theories transcend Einstein and Lovelock theories of gravity, holding true for theories with additional scalar degrees of freedom as well. Moreover, they hold in both the Jordan and the Einstein frames. However, it turns out that there are two dynamically equivalent representations of the scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame, differing by total derivatives in the action, which are thermodynamically inequivalent. This depicts the importance of having a thermodynamic description, which can be used in distinguishing various dynamically equivalent representations of gravity theories beyond Einstein.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant perturbations in teleparallel Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in the form of a catalogue of the cosmological perturbations within the Bahamonde- Dialektopoulos-Levi Said (BDLS) theory, which serves as the teleparallel counterpart of Horndeski gravity. To understand structure formation in cosmological models, it is essential to study both the background and perturbative aspects of their cosmology. While extensive analysis of both Horndeski gravity and its teleparallel analog exists in the literature, a quantitative understanding requires a detailed examination of their cosmological perturbations. We review here all the different gauges for the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations of a cosmological background up to second order and we hope this will help people who work with observations, to incorporate it in existing codes.</description>

      <title>Covariant LTB collapse in models of loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of gravitational collapse provide important means to test whether non-classical space-time effects motivated for instance by quantum gravity can be realized in generic ways in physically relevant situations. Here, a detailed analysis of marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi space-times is given in emergent modified gravity, which in particular includes a covariant formulation of holonomy modifications usually considered in models of loop quantum gravity. As a result, generic collapse in this setting is shown to imply a physical singularity that removes the bouncing behavior seen in vacuum space-times with the same type of modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An approach is presented to address singularities in general relativity using a complex Riemannian spacetime extension. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to both black hole and cosmological singularities, specifically focusing on the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes and the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Big Bang cosmology. By extending the relevant coordinates into the complex plane and carefully choosing integration contours, we show that it is possible to regularize these singularities, resulting in physically meaningful, singularity-free solutions when projected back onto real spacetime. The removal of the singularity at the Big Bang allows for a bounce cosmology. This approach offers a potential bridge between classical general relativity and quantum gravity effects, suggesting a way to resolve longstanding issues in gravitational physics without requiring a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Testing the universality of quantum gravity theories with cosmic messengers in the context of DSR theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there have been several studies devoted to the investigation of the fate of fundamental relativistic symmetries at the foreseen unification of gravity and quantum regime, that is the Planck scale. In order to preserve covariance of the formulation even if in an amended formulation, new mathematical tools are required. In this work, we consider DSR theories that modify covariance by introducing a non-trivial structure in momentum space. Additionally, we explore the possibility of investigating both universal quantum gravity corrections and scenarios where different particle species are corrected differently within the framework of these models. Several astroparticle phenomena are then analyzed to test the phenomenological predictions of DSR models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of optical geometry, defined to be a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a null line distribution, from the perspective of intrinsic torsion. This is an instance of a non-integrable version of holonomy reduction in Lorentzian geometry. These generate congruences of null curves, which play an important r\^{o}le in general relativity. Conformal properties of these are investigated. We also extend this concept to generalised optical geometries as introduced by Robinson and Trautman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal version of the antisymmetric second-order tensor field in four spacetime dimensions does not have gauge invariance extensively discussed in the literature for more than half a century. Our first observation is that, when coupled to fermions, only the conformal version provides renormalizability of the theory at the one-loop level. General considerations are supported by the derivation of one-loop divergences in the fermionic sector, indicating good chances for asymptotic freedom. The arguments concerning one-loop renormalizability remain valid in the presence of self-interactions and the masses for both fermion and antisymmetric tensor fields. In the flat spacetime limit, regardless of the conformal symmetry has gone, there is an expectation to meet renormalizability in all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomalies for (maximal) 6d conformal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the fundamental unknowns of our Universe, the mass of dark matter remains to be a topic of great interest. We consider the possibility of a time-variation of the dark matter mass. We study the cosmological constraints on a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a certain scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background shows a distinctive phase shift and power suppression at small scales. We use the latest cosmic microwave background data and the $S_8$ priors from weak lensing data to place a lower limit on the transition redshift. We also find that the data from the ACT show a mild preference for the mass-varying dark matter model over $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed fit of the 15-year data set obtained from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in terms of a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>
