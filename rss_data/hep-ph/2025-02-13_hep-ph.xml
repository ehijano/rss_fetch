      <title>Gauge hierarchy and metastability from Higgs-driven crunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on a dynamical vacuum selection mechanism in a landscape which scans the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrinos: seesaw models and signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to right-handed neutrinos as a simple extension to the Standard Model (SM), focussing on seesaw models and their possible experimental signatures. We preface this with a review of the lepton sector of the SM, where charged lepton masses arise from Yukawa couplings and neutrino Majorana masses from the Weinberg operator, leading to a unitary lepton mixing matrix. We first introduce a single right-handed neutrino and the seesaw mechanism, yielding a heavy neutral lepton, then generalise the results to the canonical case of three right-handed neutrinos within a general parameterisation, leading to non-unitary lepton mixing and three heavy neutral leptons. We show how the sequential dominance of three right-handed neutrinos with diagonal masses naturally leads to an effective two right-handed neutrino model with lepton mixing angle predictions in the constrained cases, but unobservable heavy neutral leptons. On the other hand, with degenerate off-diagonal masses, the two right-handed neutrinos can form a single heavy and observable Dirac neutrino, within a two Higgs doublet or Majoron model. Finally we discuss extra singlet neutrinos which can lead to either a double seesaw or an inverse seesaw, depending on their Majorana masses, where the latter allows observable heavy neutral leptons, and the possibility of a minimal inverse seesaw model where mixing angles can be predicted.</description>

      <title>Weak bosons as partons below 10 TeV partonic center-of-momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modeling of weak boson number densities for leptons and hadrons in practical calculations in the Standard Model. Working in the framework of the Effective $W$ Approximation (EWA) and in $R_\xi$ and axial gauges, we derive the unrenormalized, tree-level parton number density functions for weak bosons from massless leptons at next-to-leading power in the collinear expansion. Corrections exhibit a number of properties, including those conjectured but never universally derived. Parallels with heavy quark factorization are also found. We avoid pathologies through a novel set of kinematical consistency conditions. When satisfied, good agreement between the full and approximated matrix elements is achieved. Findings suggest that the EWA may be testable at the Large Hadron Collider with $450$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity of same-sign $WW$ scattering data at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavor Jet Substructure at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of event-shape observables, namely the energy correlation function and jet angularity, for heavy-flavor jets produced in electron-positron collisions, focusing on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) interactions. Using modern jet substructure techniques, we investigate the dead-cone effect, where QCD radiation is suppressed around a heavy quark within an angle proportional to its mass. Our analysis achieves next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, combined with fixed-order contributions, to improve the description of the transition near the dead-cone threshold. To ensure a comprehensive perspective, we compare our analytical results with predictions from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa Monte Carlo simulations at past and future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Dark Matter in SUSY with approximate $R-$symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the asymmetric dark matter framework, linking the ordinary and dark matter abundances, within a supersymmetric context. We consider a supersymmetric model that respects an approximate $U(1)_R$ symmetry, which is broken in such a way that at high temperature the $R$ breaking sector mediate processes in equilibrium, but at the SUSY mass scale, the sparticles asymmetry is frozen. In this framework, the gravitino serves as the dark matter candidate, and its mass is predicted to be $\sim10$ GeV to match the observed relic abundance. We identify several realistic spectra; however, the requirement for the Next-to-Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (NLSP) to decay into the gravitino before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the viable spectrum to masses above 2 TeV.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the neutrino extension of the Standard Model and baryon asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can cause new effective interactions of Standard Model particles, particularly charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) processes. The non-observation of cLFV processes, therefore, puts constraints on the parameters of the HNLs. We find the relations between the cLFV effective operators in the realistic case when active neutrino masses are non-zero and masses of the HNLs are non-degenerate. This allows us to strengthen the existing cLFV constraints. We also link the baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the same cLFV effective operators, which imposes new restrictions on their values.</description>

      <title>Screening rho-meson mass in the presence of strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the screening mass of the neutral rho-meson in the presence of strong magnetic fields using the Kroll-Lee-Zumino (KLZ) model. The rho-meson self-energy is computed at one-loop order within the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation, considering the magnetic field as the dominant energy scale. Due to Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the external field, we decompose the self-energy into three independent tensor structures, which give rise to three distinct modes. Additionally, the four-momentum splits into parallel and perpendicular components, leading to two types of screening masses: the parallel screening mass ( $p_0=0$ and $p_\perp \to 0$ ) and the perpendicular screening mass ( $p_0=0$ and $p_\parallel \to 0$ ). Our results show that the zero and perpendicular modes exhibit a monotonically increasing behavior with the magnetic field strength, whereas the parallel mode remains essentially constant. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of vector mesons in strongly magnetized media, with implications for QCD under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>ARCANE Reweighting: A Monte Carlo Technique to Tackle the Negative Weights Problem in Collider Event Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively weighted events, which appear in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of particle collisions, significantly increases the computational resource requirements of current and future collider experiments. This paper introduces and theoretically discusses an MC technique called ARCANE reweighting for reducing or eliminating negatively weighted events. The technique works by redistributing (via an additive reweighting) the contributions of different pathways within an event generator that lead to the same final event. The technique is exact and does not introduce any biases in the distributions of physical observables. A companion paper demonstrates the technique for a physics example.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of ARCANE Reweighting: Reducing the Sign Problem in the MC@NLO Generation of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow q \bar{q} + 1\, jet$ Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively weighted events, which appear in the simulation of particle collisions, significantly increase the computational requirements of collider experiments. A new technique called ARCANE reweighting has been introduced in a companion paper to tackle this problem. This paper demonstrates the technique for the next-to-leading-order generation of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow q \bar{q} + 1\, jet$ events. By redistributing the contributions of "standard" and "hard remainder" pathways in the generator that lead to the same final event, ARCANE reweighting almost completely eliminates the negative weights problem for this process. Some thoughts on implementing the technique in other scenarios are provided.</description>

      <title>Unraveling charmonium mixing scheme for the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$ by a coupled-channel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among charmoniumlike $XYZ$ states, the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$ states have emerged as key candidates for exploring the charmonium spectrum. In this work, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ charmonium mixing scheme for the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$, induced by coupled-channel effects. By constructing a coupled-channel model, we identify the dynamical mechanism responsible for the large mixing angle observed in previous studies, which cannot be explained by conventional potential models alone. Our analysis reveals that the $DD_1$ channel significantly influences the lower state ($\psi(4220)$), while the $D^*D_1$ channel primarily affects the higher state ($\psi(4380)$). Furthermore, we investigate the two-body Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI)-allowed strong decay behaviors of these states, providing insights into their total widths. This study not only supports the $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme but also offers a deeper understanding of the role of coupled channels in shaping the charmonium spectrum above 4 GeV. Our results align with experimental observations and provide a framework for interpreting future data on charmonium states.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling from hadronic $\tau$-decay data including $\tau\to\pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ from Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we have combined the $\pi^-\pi^0$, $2\pi^-\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-3\pi^0$ spectral data obtained from hadronic $\tau$ decays measured by the ALEPH and OPAL experiments, together with electroproduction data for several of the subleading hadronic modes and BaBar data for the $K\bar{K}$ mode to construct an inclusive non-strange vector spectral function entirely based on experimental data, with no Monte-Carlo generated input. In this paper, we include, for the first time, the Belle $\tau\to\pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ high-statistics decay data to construct a new inclusive non-strange vector spectral function that combines more of the world's available data. As no Belle data are at present available for the two $4\pi$ modes, this requires a revised data analysis in comparison with our previous work. From the resulting new spectral function, we obtain a new determination of the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, using our previously developed strategy based on finite-energy sum rules. We find, at the $Z$ mass scale, $\alpha_s(m_Z^2)=0.1159(14)$. We discuss the smaller central value and larger error of our new result compared to our previous result, showing the shifts to be due mainly to significant changes in updated HFLAV results for the $\pi^-3\pi^0$ decay mode.</description>

      <title>Bring the noise: exact inference from noisy simulations in collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rely on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to interpret searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere. These simulations result in noisy and approximate estimators of selection efficiencies and likelihoods. In this context we pioneer an exact-approximate computational method - exact-approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo - that returns exact inferences despite noisy simulations. To do so, we introduce an unbiased estimator for a Poisson likelihood. We demonstrate the new estimator and new techniques in examples based on a search for neutralinos and charginos at the LHC using a simplified model. We find attractive performance characteristics - exact inferences are obtained for a similar computational cost to approximate ones from existing methods and inferences are robust with respect to the number of events generated per point.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$. In the absence of continuous Wilson line phases, product group unification models can be constructed based on $SU(7)$ and $SU(8)$ gauge models. When continuous Wilson line phases are present, we find that a minimal model, namely, an $SU(6)$ gauge model, can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry. In addition, this model has excellent features that two Higgs doublets appear from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. We show that there exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken, as a minimum of the effective potential for the continuous Wilson line phases, by adding suitable bulk fields, in a toy model. This electroweak symmetry breaking can be naturally understood in terms of the two Higgs doublet model, and mass eigenstates of the neutral Higgs bosons are examined, including the component corresponding to the nonflat direction, which does not appear in the continuous Wilson line phases. We also discuss the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points. We show that their direct contributions to the Higgs masses can be forbidden by a reflection symmetry, and thus, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Measuring Top Yukawa Coupling through $2\rightarrow 3$ VBS at Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the measurement of top Yukawa coupling through $2\rightarrow 3$ VBS at future muon colliders, focusing on the lepton and semi-lepton channels of $\nu\nu tth/z$. First, analyzing the partonic amplitudes of $W_LW_L\rightarrow t\bar t h/Z_L$ and simulating the full processes of $\nu\nu tth/z$ without decaying, we find they are highly sensitive to the anomalous top Yukawa $\delta y_t$. This sensitivity is enhanced by selecting helicities of the final $t\bar t$ and $Z$ to be $t_L\bar t_L+t_R\bar t_R$ and $Z_L$, which serves as the default and core setting of our analysis. We then obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ with this setting, giving $[-1.0\%, 1.1\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ only and $[-0.36\%, 0.92\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ and $\nu\nu ttz$ combined at $30$ TeV and $1\sigma$. Second, we proceed to analyze the processes after decaying and with background processes. To enhance the sensitivity to $\delta y_t$, our settings include selecting the helicities of the final particles, as well as applying suitable cuts. However, we don't do bin-by-bin analysis. We obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ for those channels at $10/30$ TeV and $1\sigma/2 \sigma$. The best limit is from the semi-lepton channel of $\nu\nu tth$. With spin tagging efficiency at $\epsilon_s=0.9$, it gives $[-1.6\% , 1.8\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $ [-2.4\%, 2.7\% ]$ at $2\sigma$ at $30$ TeV; $[-7.0\%, 6.7\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $[-9.8\%, 9.8\%]$ at $2\sigma$ at $10$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the FCC-ee to decay of an axion-like particle into two photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the $Z$ boson into axion-like particles (ALP) at the $Z$-pole run of the proposed CERN FCC-ee collider is investigated. We perform a detailed study of final states with three photons or with a single photon and missing energy, yielding an evaluation of the accessible values of the ALP coupling to the photon for ALP masses between 0.1 and 85 GeV. Special attention is paid to the experimental implications of detecting the three-photon signature for the ALP mass region below 10~GeV. The FCC-ee run will be able to detect the ALP for couplings down to a few $10^{-3}~\mathrm{TeV}^{-1}$ over the considered mass range in an effective model where the ALP only couples to the U(1) boson of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-local contributions in $B_{s} \to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ including higher-twist effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) on the non-local form factors for the $B_s\to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ transition focusing on the 'charm-loop' contribution within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) framework. To analytically continue these charm-loop contributions into the kinematically allowed region of the decay, we employ a hadronic dispersion relation that incorporates intermediate resonant states such as the $\phi$, $J/\Psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons. Here, the LCSR predictions serve as inputs, supplemented by experimental data from two-body decays $B_s \to \phi$ $+$ resonance states. Our results indicate that the inclusion of twist-5 and twist-6 LCDAs enhances the non-local form factors$-$by approximately an order of magnitude$-$compared to previous estimates, due to partial disruption of cancellation among different twist contributions. This leads to a dilepton invariant mass-squared ($q^2-$)dependent correction to the Wilson coefficient $C_9$, which is higher than, but still consistent with the Standard Model prediction within uncertainties. Additionally, we update the local form factors to include contributions from higher-twist three-particle $B_s-$meson LCDAs. The phenomenological implications, particularly for the differential branching fraction and angular observables, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in an expanding medium -- hot remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $\phi^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Building Neutron Stars with the MUSES Calculation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. We present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. Using the Synthesis module, we match the three equations of state using different thermodynamic variables and different methods. We then couple the complete equation of state to a novel full-general-relativity solver (QLIMR) module that calculates neutron star properties. We find that the matching performed using different thermodynamic variables affects differently the range obtained for neutron star masses and radii (although never beyond a few percent difference). We also investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, we use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</description>

      <title>Inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering off $^{203/205}$Tl in terms of the nuclear recoil energy using a hybrid nuclear model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear structure calculations in the context of a novel hybrid nuclear model, combining the nuclear shell model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model are presented. The predictivity of the hybrid model is tested by computing inelastic neutral-current neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections off the stable thallium isotopes. The cross sections are presented in terms of the incoming neutrino energy, taking also into account the effect of nuclear recoil energy. Also reported are the expected event rates assuming neutrinos emerging from pion-decay at rest and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Regarding solar neutrino rates, new results are presented in the context of the hybrid model and compared with previously reported results based solely on nuclear shell model calculations, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the adopted hybrid model at higher neutrino energies.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$: package for numerical computation of Lauricella functions depending on a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, a computational tool developed in Wolfram Mathematica for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions with indices linearly dependent on a parameter, $\varepsilon$. The package leverages a method based on analytical continuation via Frobenius generalized power series, providing an efficient and accurate alternative to conventional approaches relying on multi-dimensional series expansions or Mellin--Barnes representations. This one-dimensional approach is particularly advantageous for high-precision calculations and facilitates further optimization through $\varepsilon$-dependent reconstruction from evaluations at specific numerical values, enabling efficient parallelization. The underlying mathematical framework for this method has been detailed in our previous work, while the current paper focuses on the design, implementation, and practical applications of the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package.</description>

      <title>Markarian 501 reincarnates with vigor as a temporary EHBL during VHE flaring in July 2014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markarian 501, a well known high energy BL Lac object, has exhibited several epochs of very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flaring events when its synchrotron peak frequency shifted above $10^{17}$ Hz, a signature of extreme behavior. From July 16 to July 31, 2014 such flaring events were observed for 15 days by various telescopes. On July 19 (MJD 56857.98), the X-ray outburst from the source was at its highest and on the same day an intriguing narrow peak-like feature around 3 TeV was observed by MAGIC telescopes, a feature inconsistent with standard interpretations. Using the well known two-zone photohadronic model, we study these VHE gamma-ray spectra on a day-by-day basis and offer explanation. Our two-zone photohadronic scenario shows that, on MJD 56857.98, the peak-like feature appears at a cutoff energy of $E^c_{\gamma}$ = 3.18 TeV. Below this energy the observed VHE spectrum increases slowly and above $E^c_{\gamma}$ it falls faster, thus resulting in a mild peak-like feature.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element (NME) remains a critical challenge in designing and interpreting experiments aimed at discovering neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Here, we identify a class of observables, distinct from those employed in low-energy nuclear structure applications, that are strongly correlated with the NME: momentum correlations among hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. Focusing on the $^{150}$Nd$\rightarrow$$^{150}$Sm transition, we combine a Bayesian analysis of the structure of $^{150}$Nd with simulations of high-energy $^{150}$Nd+$^{150}$Nd collisions. We reveal prominent correlations between the NME and features of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these processes, such as spatial gradients and anisotropies, which are accessible via collective flow measurements. Our findings demonstrate collider experiments involving $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay candidates as a platform for benchmarking theoretical predictions of the NME.</description>

      <title>Scale Setting and Strong Coupling Determination in the Gradient Flow Scheme for 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a scale determination, scale setting, and determination of the strong coupling in the gradient flow scheme using the $N_f=2+1$ highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the HotQCD Collaboration for bare gauge couplings ranging from $\beta = 7.030$ to $8.400$. The gradient flow scales we obtain in this work are $\sqrt{t_0} = 0.14229(98)$~fm and $w_0 = 0.17190(140)$~fm. Using the decay constants of the kaon and $\eta_s$, as well as the bottomonium mass splitting from the literature, we also calculate the potential scale $r_1$, obtaining $r_1 = 0.3072(22)$~fm. We fit the flow scales to an Allton-type ansatz as a function of $\beta$, providing a polynomial expression that allows for the prediction of lattice spacings at new $beta$ values. As a secondary result, we make an attempt to determine $\Lambda_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}$ and use it to estimate the strong coupling in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.</description>

      <title>$\phi$ meson in nuclear matter and atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties (masses and decay widths) of the $\phi$ meson are investigated in nuclear matter from the $\phi$ meson self-energy, using the tree-level $\phi K\bar{K}$ Lagrangian, and, incorporating in-medium masses of (anti)kaons calculated within the quark meson coupling (QMC) model. These mass shifts and decay widths are incorporated in the Breit-Wigner spectral function of the $\phi$ meson to calculate the production cross-section of $\phi$ in asymmetric nuclear matter. Considerable modifications to the production cross-section are observed at normal nuclear matter density, driven by the in-medium mass reduction and the increase in the decay width of $\phi$ meson. The potential experienced by $\phi$ meson in nuclear matter is used to study the possibility of formation of the $\phi$ mesic bound state with atomic nuclei. We explore the potential formation of $\phi$-mesic bound states in ${\rm{^{4}He}}$, ${\rm{^{12}C}}$, ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, ${\rm{^{197}Au}}$ and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$ nuclei by investigating their binding energies and absorption widths based on the corresponding $\phi$-nucleus potentials. Our study shows shallow bound states with the light nuclei and deeply bound states in heavy nuclei. Among the investigated nuclei, a particularly distinct signal for a $\phi$-mesic bound state is identified in ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, suggesting its potential experimental observability. The work provides valuable insights into $\phi$ meson interactions in infinite nuclear matter and the potential formation of exotic $\phi$-mesic nuclear states, offering promising probes for strongly interacting matter in the upcoming experiments at J-PARC, JLab, and ${\rm{\bar{P}}ANDA}$@FAIR physics program.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>CMS results for the $\gamma \gamma$ production at the LHC: do they give a hint for a Higgs boson of the maximally CP symmetric two-Higgs-doublet model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the CMS experiment at the LHC show possibly, with about 3 $\sigma$ significance, a resonance in di-photon events with an invariant mass of 95.4 GeV. If this resonance can be confirmed, this could be a hint for a new elementary particle beyond the Standard Model. An additional Standard-model-like Higgs boson with this mass could be excluded by the CMS experiment. We investigate whether this resonance could fit into a two-Higgs-doublet model highly constrained by CP symmetry, the so-called maximally-CP-symmetric model (MCPM). In the strict symmetry limit of the MCPM only the fermions of the third generation obtain masses. We discuss a mechanism where the first and second generation fermions get masses through effects from interactions with very high mass particles. The latter can be integrated out at LHC energies giving effective Lagrangian terms, among them these mass terms. This procedure also gives us a Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix which automatically satisfies some salient structural features observed in experiments. We call the resulting theory MCPM'. Our finding shows that indeed the enhancement measured by CMS could originate from the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ of this model. According to the model the boson $h''$ would mainly be produced in the Drell-Yan reaction by charm-anticharm-quark fusion. The main decay mode of $h''$ is predicted to be $h'' \to c\bar{c}$. We then consider the so called oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ which give us an allowed region for the mass of the scalar Higgs boson $h'$ versus that of the charged ones $H^\pm$ of the MCPM'. We calculate the effect of these charged bosons $H^\pm$ in the leptonic decays of the charm mesons $D^\pm$ and the charm-strange mesons $D_s^\pm$. Our results indicate that the mass $m_{H^\pm}$ of the charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$ of the MCPM' should be around 300 GeV.</description>

      <title>Two Higgs doublet model fitting and $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ signal at the ILC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most straightforward extensions of the standard model (SM) is having an additional Higgs doublet to the SM, namely the two Higgs doublet models(THDM). In the type-I model, an additional Higgs doublet is introduced that does not couple to any fermion via the Yukawa interaction in the original Lagrangian. Considering various theoretical and phenomenological constraints, we have found the best-fitted parameter set in the type-I model using the minimum $\chi^2$ method by scanning the model's parameter space. We show that this optimal parameter set can be tested by precisely analyzing the decay processes $D^+_s \rightarrow \tau^+ \nu_\tau$, $D^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$, and $B^0 \rightarrow K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$. Moreover, the decay channels $h \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ can be used to distinguish the model from the SM. For a direct search of the model at future colliders, we have proposed an investigation of the $e^+e^- \rightarrow t\bar{t} b\bar{b}$ process at the ILC to detect the new physics of the model. Considering the initial state radiation correction and applying appropriate background cuts, the calculation result of the scattering cross section shows that it is feasible to observe a clear and unique signal in the $t\bar{b}$ invariant mass distribution corresponding to the charged Higgs pair creations.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing short-lived particles using hypergraph representation learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In collider experiments, the kinematic reconstruction of heavy, short-lived particles is vital for precision tests of the Standard Model and in searches for physics beyond it. Performing kinematic reconstruction in collider events with many final-state jets, such as the all-hadronic decay of top-antitop quark pairs, is challenging. We present HyPER: Hypergraph for Particle Event Reconstruction, a novel architecture based on graph neural networks that uses hypergraph representation learning to build more powerful and efficient representations of collider events. HyPER is used to reconstruct parent particles from sets of final-state objects. Trained and tested on simulation, the HyPER model is shown to perform favorably when compared to existing state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, while demonstrating superior parameter efficiency. The novel hypergraph approach allows the method to be applied to particle reconstruction in a multitude of different physics processes.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ within resonance chiral theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.178\pm0.071)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Explaining Fermions Mass and Mixing Hierarchies through $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing, we extend the Standard Model gauge group with \( U(1)_X \) and \( Z_2 \) symmetry. The field content of the Standard Model is augmented by three heavy right-handed neutrinos, two new scalar singlets, and a scalar doublet. \( U(1)_X \) charges of different fields are determined after satisfying anomaly cancellation conditions. In this scenario, the fermion masses are generated through higher-dimensional effective operators with \( O(1) \) Yukawa couplings. The small neutrino masses are obtained through type-1 seesaw mechanism using the heavy right-handed neutrino fields, whose masses are generated by the new scalar fields. We discuss the flavour-changing neutral current processes that arise due to the sequential nature of \( U(1)_X \) symmetry. We have written effective higher-dimensional operators in terms of renormalizable dimension-four operators by introducing vector-like fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel search strategy for heavy top-philic resonances that induce new contributions to four-top production at the LHC. We capitalize on recent advances in top-tagging performance to demonstrate that the final state, that is expected to be boosted based on current limits, can be fully reconstructed and exploited. Notably, our approach promises bounds on new physics cross-sections that are a few to 60 times stronger than those obtained with existing searches, showcasing its unprecedented effectiveness in probing top-philic new physics.</description>

      <title>General Discussions on the SU(2) Vector Boson Dark Matter Model with a Single Higgs Multiplet -- Lagrangian, Discrete Subgroups, and Scalar Classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vector boson dark matter particles which stem from some broken gauge symmetries usually requires some unbroken symmetries to keep themselves stable. In the previous literature, some simplest cases have been discussed, in which the unbroken symmetry is provided by a remnant subgroup of the gauge group. It would be interesting to ask whether all the possible remnant subgroups as well as all the possible coupling forms can be enumerated. Classifying all the Higgs components into different mass degenerate representations to simplify the diagonalization processes is also necessary. Rather than the ambitious target of providing a general solution to all kinds of gauge groups configured with all forms of the Higgs multiplets, in this paper, we concentrate on the case of $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{D}}$ gauge group together with a single Higgs multiplet. We enumerate all possible discrete subgroups that can survive up to $n=21$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Higgs multiplet. We also provide the general algorithms to enumerate all possible renormalizable operators, to write down the general forms of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) configurations, and to give the detailed results of all the mass degenerate irreducible representations embedded in the Higgs multiplet.</description>

      <title>Hard processes in multi-TeV ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion-collision program at the Large Hadron Collider, plans for its high-luminosity upgrade, and on-going discussions for multi-TeV future hadron colliders, we systematically investigate hard-scattering, Standard Model processes in many-TeV ion-ion collisions. We focus on the symmetric beam configurations $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb, $^{131}$Xe-$^{131}$Xe, $^{12}$C-$^{12}$C, and $pp$, and we catalog total and fiducial cross sections for dozens of processes, ranging from associated-Higgs and multiboson production to associated-top pair production, at next-to-leading order in QCD for nucleon-nucleon collision energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=1$ to $100$ TeV. We report the residual scale uncertainties at this order as well as the uncertainties originating from fits of nuclear parton densities. We also discuss the propagation of nuclear dynamics (as encoded in nuclear parton densities) into parton luminosities, and ultimately into predictions for cross sections. Finally, we report on the emergence of trends and the reliability of extrapolating cross sections across different nuclei. For Pb-Pb collisions at a hypothetical Future Circular Collider with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=39$ TeV, $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ weak bosons, $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ diboson pairs, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ $WH$ and $ZH$ pairs, $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ triboson events, $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ high-$p_T$ photons events, and $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ $t\overline{t}$ pairs can be produced with $\mathcal{L}=33$~nb$^{-1}$ of data. At $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.52$ TeV, one can expect $\mathcal{O}(10-10^6)$ single, multiboson, and top events per $1$ nb$^{-1}$. Decay rates and experimental selection/acceptance rates will impact final event yields, and merits further study; as an illustrative example, we focus on select diboson and triboson channels in lead-lead collisions and discuss their observability at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC and the FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The very high luminosity run foreseen at the $Z$-pole for the FCC-ee will allow the detection in $Z$ decays of new particles with very low couplings to the Standard Model. These particles can have measurable flight paths before they decay. If the timing and the position of the decay vertex can be measured with high precision, the mass of such particles can be measured by exploiting the constrained kinematics of an $e^+e^-$ collider. The mass resolution achievable with this technique is studied through a detailed analysis in the framework of a parametrised simulation of the performance of the IDEA detector. The adopted benchmark model is the production of Heavy Neutral Leptons, which is one of the key channels for new physics discovery at the FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Higgs Mass Predictions in the CP-Violating High-Scale NMSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a supersymmetric theory, large mass hierarchies can lead to large uncertainties in fixed-order calculations of the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs mass. A reliable prediction is then obtained by performing the calculation in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, involving a matching to the full supersymmetric theory at the high scale to include contributions from the heavy particles, and a subsequent renormalisation-group running down to the low scale. We report on the prediction of the SM-like Higgs mass within the CP-violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM) in a scenario where all non-SM particles feature TeV-scale masses. The matching conditions are calculated at full one-loop order using two approaches. These are the matching of the quartic Higgs couplings as well as of the SM-like Higgs pole masses of the low- and high-scale theory. A comparison between the two methods allows us to estimate the size of terms suppressed by the heavy mass scale that are neglected in a pure EFT calculation as given by the quartic-coupling matching. Furthermore, we study the different sources of uncertainty which enter our calculation as well as the effect of CP-violating phases on the Higgs mass prediction. The matching calculation is implemented in a new version of the public program package NMSSMCALC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New gauge forces can play an important role in the evolution of the early universe. In this work we investigate the cosmological implications of a pure Yang-Mills dark sector that is dominantly populated after primordial inflation. Such a dark sector takes the form of a bath of dark gluons at high temperatures, but confines at lower temperatures to produce a spectrum of dark glueballs. These glueballs then undergo a freezeout process such that the remnant population is nearly completely dominated by the lightest state. To reproduce the observed cosmology, this lightest glueball species must decay to the Standard Model to repopulate and reheat it. At leading order, this can occur through a connector operator of dimension-6. In contrast, other glueballs can be parametrically long-lived or stable, and remain as contributors to dark matter or modify the observed cosmology through their later decays. In this work we study the evolution of such dark sectors in detail. We demonstrate that stable remnant glueballs can produce the measured dark matter abundance. We also derive broad constraints on non-Abelian dark sectors from overproduction of remnant glueballs when they are stable or from their destructive impact when they are able to decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. An imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from $N_{2}$ and triplet fermion decay through resonant leptogenesis scenario. The Yukawa coupling of triplet plays significant role both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The Muon $(g-2)$ and dark matter both favor the same parameter space for mass of the dark matter and the triplet fermion.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit for the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to l_\beta\,\gamma$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes. Our analytic results are consistent, as they are gauge invariant, gauge independent, ultraviolet finite, and of decoupling nature. Among the decays $l_\alpha\to l_\beta\gamma$, we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be the most promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that the constraints on non-unitarity effects from MEG data will be improved by the upcoming MEG II update by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</description>

Abstract: Dirac demonstrated that the existence of a single magnetic monopole in the universe could explain the discrete nature of electric charge. Magnetic monopoles naturally arise in most grand unified theories. However, the extensive experimental searches conducted thus far have not been successful. Here, we propose a mechanism in which magnetic monopoles bind deeply with neutral states, effectively hiding some of the properties of free monopoles. We explore various scenarios for these systems and analyze their detectability. In particular, one scenario is especially interesting, as it predicts a light state-an analog of an electron but with magnetic charge instead of electric charge-which we refer to as a magnetron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on the recent measurements of the scattering processes $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ and $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$ reported by BESIII, we offer a dynamical interpretation of the differences in the measured total and differential cross sections for both processes. This discrepancy arises because the $u$-channel contribution is forbidden for $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ but allowed for $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$. Additionally, we examine the enhancement effect in the forward angle region of the differential cross section for $\bar{\Lambda} p$ elastic scattering, attributed to the $t$-channel contribution. This work serves as a test to the scattering mechanism involved in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Probing the mass effect of heavy quark jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of heavy quark (HQ) jets provides a new arena to address the mass effect of jet quenching in heavy-ion physics. This paper presents a theoretical study of HQ jet yield suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and focuses on the energy loss of HQ jets produced by different mechanisms. The p+p baseline is carried out by the SHERPA generator, and the jet-medium interactions are described by the SHELL transport model, which considers the elastic and inelastic partonic energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In p+p collisions, our numerical results indicate that the HQ jets from gluon splitting ($g \rightarrow Q$-jet) give the dominant contribution at high $p_T$, and it shows more dispersive structures than the HQ-initiated one ($Q \rightarrow Q$-jet). In nucleus-nucleus collisions, our calculations are consistent with the inclusive and b-jet $R_{AA}$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration, which suggests a remarkable manifestation of the mass effect of jet energy loss. As a result of the dispersive substructure, the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will lose more energy than the $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet in the QGP. Due to the significant contribution of $g \rightarrow c$-jet, the $R_{AA}$ of c-jet will be comparable or even smaller than that of inclusive jet. To experimentally distinguish the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet and $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet, we propose the event selection strategies based on their topological features and test the performances. By isolating the $c \rightarrow c$-jet and $b \rightarrow b$-jet, the jets initiated by heavy quarks, we predict that the order of their $R_{AA}$ are in line with the mass hierarchy of energy loss. Future measurements on the $R_{AA}$ of $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet and $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will provide a unique chance to test the flavor/mass dependence of energy loss at the jet level.</description>

      <title>A minimalistic model for inelastic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of inelastic (or pseudo-Dirac) dark matter commonly introduce a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken by the introduction of a dark sector version of the Higgs mechanism. We find that this ubiquitous introduction of two extra fields, a vector and a complex scalar boson, is indeed unnecessary, with only a mass generating real scalar field being actually required. We consider a simple UV-complete model realizing this minimal setup and study the decays of the excited dark matter state as well as constraints from perturbative unitarity, (in)direct detection and colliders. We find that, in the visible freeze-out scenario ($ \text{DM} \, \text{DM} \leftrightarrow \text{SM} \, \text{SM} $), we still have unconstrained regions of parameter space for dark matter masses $\gtrsim 100$~GeV. Moreover, most of the available regions either present long-lived excited states, which are expected to interfere with the standard cosmological history, or will be probed by future direct detection experiments, such as DARWIN, due to the unavoidable residual elastic interactions. The only regions remaining out of experimental reach present highly fine-tuned parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extension of Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures. We also examine both direct and indirect detection prospects for this DM candidate and assess the model against current experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

Abstract: Hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering defines one of the critical contributions in the Standard-Model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this Letter, we present a complete evaluation using a dispersive formalism, in which the HLbL tensor is reconstructed from its discontinuities, expressed in terms of simpler hadronic matrix elements that can be extracted from experiment. Profiting from recent developments in the determination of axial-vector transition form factors, short-distance constraints for the HLbL tensor, and the vector-vector-axial-vector correlator, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$, which meets the precision requirements set by the final result of the Fermilab experiment.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the SUSY $\mu$-problem within the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The explicit $\mu$-term is prohibited by modular symmetry, and an effective $\mu$-term is regenerated following the stabilization of the modulus field. We examine the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described by the non-linear SUSY realization scheme involving a nilpotent Goldstino $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ superfield. The inclusion of $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ contributions can slightly alter the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value near some fixed point. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$, significantly smaller than the SUSY scale, can result from either the expansion of typical modular forms using a small deviation parameter near the fixed point $\omega$, or from the combined effects of suppression by powers of $q^{1/24}$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] along with the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$, taking the form of appropriate power of the tiny deviation parameter.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced neutron, proton and alpha evaporation from heavy nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb nuclei are excited through interactions induced by strong electromagnetic fields. The expected excitation energy could reach hundreds MeV, which leads to the subsequent emission of various particles, including neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. To accurately describe deexcitation of nuclei, we have developed two novel approaches. The first method utilizes the Heavy Ion Phase Space Exploration (HIPSE) model to simulate pre-equilibrium emissions and to estimate the excitation energy of the remaining nucleus. Our second approach introduces a new technique for modeling the excitation energy of the nucleus. This method consists of a two-component function to represent the excitation energy distribution more precisely, accounting for the energy loss due to the interaction between photons and quasi-deuteron. Both of these modeling techniques are integrated with the results produced by the GEMINI++ generator, which implements the Hauser-Feshbach formalism to simulate the statistical decay of excited nuclei. The alternative calculations are done with EMPIRE platform. Using these approaches, we obtained the cross sections for the emission of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles resulting from UPC at the LHC. Our results were compared with the experimental data of the ALICE group on neutron and proton multiplicities.</description>

      <title>On the scalar sector of 2HDM: ring of basis invariants, syzygies, and six-loop renormalization-group equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generating set of reparametrization invariants that can be constructed from the couplings and masses entering the scalar potential of the general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Being independent of higgs-basis rotations, they generate a polynomial ring of basis invariants that represent the physical content of the model. Ignoring for the moment gauge and Yukawa interactions, we derive six-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for all the invariants entering the set. We do not compute a single Feynman diagram but rely heavily on the general RGE results for scalar theories. We use linear algebra together with techniques from Invariant Theory. The latter not only allow one to compute the number of linearly independent invariants entering beta functions at a certain loop order (via Hilbert series) but also provide a convenient tool for dealing with polynomial relations (so-called syzygies) between invariants from the generating set.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale power spectrum with gravitational-wave diffractive lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel way to probe subgalactic-scale matter distribution with diffractive lensing on gravitational waves. Five-year observations from Einstein Telescope and DECIGO are expected to probe $k= 10^5\sim 10^8 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ down to $P(k) = 10^{-16} \sim 10^{-14} \,{\rm Mpc}^3$ level. These results can be interpreted in terms of primordial black holes in the range $M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ down to $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-6}$ level, or QCD axion minihalos in the range $m_a = 10^{-3} \sim 10^{-12} \,{\rm eV}$. A key result of the paper is the approximate relation between the scale $k$ and the gravitational wave frequency $f$, derived in an ensemble of `multi-lensing' events. This relation enables direct measurement of the power spectrum at specific scales, with sensitivities characterized by model-independent kernels $\delta P(k)$. Additionally, we delineate the statistical properties of `multi-lensing' based on the `Fresnel number' $N_F$. When $N_F \gtrsim {\cal O}(1)$, the statistical significance can be approximately calculated by Variance of lensing effects, which is directly related to the power spectrum among other moments of matter distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties. Following its first detection by the COHERENT collaboration, recent reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle, neutrino electromagnetic properties - including charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment - as well as non-standard interactions and light mediators. We also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>Type-II Seesaw Mechanism for Dirac Neutrinos and its Implications on $N_{\text{eff}}$ and Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type II seesaw is a popular mechanism for generating Majorana neutrino masses at the right scale, with well-known implications for Lepton Flavor Violation. In a non-abelian extension of the Standard Model featuring a Z' field, the type-II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrino masses naturally arises by imposing lepton number conservation and adding a soft-term breaking a $Z_2$ symmetry of the model. As expected, there are interesting outcomes for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, but we noticed that the number of relativistic neutrinos, $N_{\text{eff}}$, has a greater impact driven by processes involving the $Z'$ boson and right-handed neutrinos. The presence of a gauge symmetry behind the physical processes, allows us to explore an interesting interplay between the type II seesaw, lepton flavor violation and $N_{\text{eff}}$. We find that using the indicated value by Planck $N_{\text{eff}}=2.99^{0.34}_{0.33}$ we impose constraints on the masses of the doubly charged scalar and Z' fields which are complementarity to direct searches at colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Radiation Scattering Enhances CMB Phase Shift through Dark Matter-loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of CMB spectra is a characteristic signature for the presence of non-photon radiation propagating differently from photons, even when the radiation couples to SM particles solely gravitationally. It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\theta_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance. An increased $\theta_s$ and a suppressed matter power spectrum is therefore a generic feature of models containing dark matter scattering with abundant dark radiation.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from an oscillating axion-like field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for isotropic cosmic birefringence with an axion-like field that rapidly oscillates during the recombination epoch. In conventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads to a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the EB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By introducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes incomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also results in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB observations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field responsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as an inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.</description>
