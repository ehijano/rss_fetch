      <title>Relative position of a parabola or a hyperbola and an ellipse without computing intersection points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient methods to determine the relative position of two conics are of great interest for applications in robotics, computer animation, CAGD, computational physics, and other areas. We present a method to obtain the relative position of a parabola or a hyperbola, and a coplanar ellipse, directly from the coefficients of their implicit equations, even if they are not given in canonical form, and avoiding the computation of the corresponding intersection points (and their characteristics).</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Proof of Universal Optimality for Computing a Planar Convex Hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a planar point set $P$, its convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all points in $P$. The construction of the convex hull from an array $I_P$ containing $P$ is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. By sorting $I_P$ in lexicographical order, one can construct the convex hull of $P$ in $O(n \log n)$ time which is worst-case optimal. Standard worst-case analysis, however, has been criticized as overly coarse or pessimistic, and researchers search for more refined analyses.
  Universal analysis provides an even stronger guarantee. It fixes a point set $P$ and considers the maximum running time across all permutations $I_P$ of $P$. Afshani, Barbay, Chan [FOCS'07] prove that the convex hull construction algorithm by Kirkpatrick, McQueen, and Seidel is universally optimal. Their proof restricts the model of computation to any algebraic decision tree model where the test functions have at most constant degree and at most a constant number of arguments. They rely upon involved algebraic arguments to construct a lower bound for each point set $P$ that matches the universal running time of [SICOMP'86].
  We provide a different proof of universal optimality. Instead of restricting the computational model, we further specify the output. We require as output (1) the convex hull, and (2) for each internal point of $P$ a witness for it being internal. Our argument is shorter, perhaps simpler, and applicable in more general models of computation.</description>

      <title>MASH: Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances for 3D Shape Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances (MASH), a novel multi-view and parametrized representation of 3D shapes. Inspired by multi-view geometry and motivated by the importance of perceptual shape understanding for learning 3D shapes, MASH represents a 3D shape as a collection of observable local surface patches, each defined by a spherical distance function emanating from an anchor point. We further leverage the compactness of spherical harmonics to encode the MASH functions, combined with a generalized view cone with a parameterized base that masks the spatial extent of the spherical function to attain locality. We develop a differentiable optimization algorithm capable of converting any point cloud into a MASH representation accurately approximating ground-truth surfaces with arbitrary geometry and topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH is versatile for multiple applications including surface reconstruction, shape generation, completion, and blending, achieving superior performance thanks to its unique representation encompassing both implicit and explicit features.</description>
