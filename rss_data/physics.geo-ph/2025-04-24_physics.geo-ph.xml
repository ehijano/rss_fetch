      <title>Real-time Bayesian inference at extreme scale: A digital twin for tsunami early warning applied to the Cascadia subduction zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inversion-based digital twin that employs acoustic pressure data from seafloor sensors, along with 3D coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer earthquake-induced spatiotemporal seafloor motion in real time and forecast tsunami propagation toward coastlines for early warning with quantified uncertainties. Our target is the Cascadia subduction zone, with one billion parameters. Computing the posterior mean alone would require 50 years on a 512 GPU machine. Instead, exploiting the shift invariance of the parameter-to-observable map and devising novel parallel algorithms, we induce a fast offline-online decomposition. The offline component requires just one adjoint wave propagation per sensor; using MFEM, we scale this part of the computation to the full El Capitan system (43,520 GPUs) with 92% weak parallel efficiency. Moreover, given real-time data, the online component exactly solves the Bayesian inverse and forecasting problems in 0.2 seconds on a modest GPU system, a ten-billion-fold speedup.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares-Embedded Optimization for Accelerated Convergence of PINNs in Acoustic Wavefield Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation. However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.</description>

      <title>Distinct hydrologic response patterns and trends worldwide revealed by physics-embedded learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To track rapid changes within our water sector, Global Water Models (GWMs) need to realistically represent hydrologic systems' response patterns - such as baseflow fraction - but are hindered by their limited ability to learn from data. Here we introduce a high-resolution physics-embedded big-data-trained model as a breakthrough in reliably capturing characteristic hydrologic response patterns ('signatures') and their shifts. By realistically representing the long-term water balance, the model revealed widespread shifts - up to ~20% over 20 years - in fundamental green-blue-water partitioning and baseflow ratios worldwide. Shifts in these response patterns, previously considered static, contributed to increasing flood risks in northern mid-latitudes, heightening water supply stresses in southern subtropical regions, and declining freshwater inputs to many European estuaries, all with ecological implications. With more accurate simulations at monthly and daily scales than current operational systems, this next-generation model resolves large, nonlinear seasonal runoff responses to rainfall ('elasticity') and streamflow flashiness in semi-arid and arid regions. These metrics highlight regions with management challenges due to large water supply variability and high climate sensitivity, but also provide tools to forecast seasonal water availability. This capability newly enables global-scale models to deliver reliable and locally relevant insights for water management.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Reconstruction of Ground Motion During Small Magnitude Earthquakes: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a pilot investigation into a novel method for reconstructing real-time ground motion during small magnitude earthquakes (M &lt; 4.5), removing the need for computationally expensive source characterization and simulation processes to assess ground shaking. Small magnitude earthquakes, which occur frequently and can be modeled as point sources, provide ideal conditions for evaluating real-time reconstruction methods. Utilizing sparse observation data, the method applies the Gappy Auto-Encoder (Gappy AE) algorithm for efficient field data reconstruction. This is the first study to apply the Gappy AE algorithm to earthquake ground motion reconstruction. Numerical experiments conducted with SW4 simulations demonstrate the method's accuracy and speed across varying seismic scenarios. The reconstruction performance is further validated using real seismic data from the Berkeley area in California, USA, demonstrating the potential for practical application of real-time earthquake data reconstruction using Gappy AE. As a pilot investigation, it lays the groundwork for future applications to larger and more complex seismic events.</description>

      <title>Surface to Seafloor: A Generative AI Framework for Decoding the Ocean Interior State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding subsurface ocean dynamics is essential for quantifying oceanic heat and mass transport, but direct observations at depth remain sparse due to logistical and technological constraints. In contrast, satellite missions provide rich surface datasets-such as sea surface height, temperature, and salinity-that offer indirect but potentially powerful constraints on the ocean interior. Here, we present a probabilistic framework based on score-based diffusion models to reconstruct three-dimensional subsurface velocity and buoyancy fields, including the energetic ocean eddy field, from surface observations. Using a 15-level primitive equation simulation of an idealized double-gyre system, we evaluate the skill of the model in inferring the mean circulation and the mesoscale variability at depth under varying levels of surface information. We find that the generative model successfully recovers key dynamical structures and provides physically meaningful uncertainty estimates, with predictive skill diminishing systematically as the surface resolution decreases or the inference depth increases. These results demonstrate the potential of generative approaches for ocean state estimation and uncertainty quantification, particularly in regimes where traditional deterministic methods are underconstrained or ill-posed.</description>
