      <title>Unveiling resilient superconducting fluctuations in atomically thin NbSe$_2$ through Higgs mode spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a combined electrical transport and optical study of the superconductivity in atomically thin NbSe$_2$. When subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, an anomalous metallic state emerges, characterized by a finite longitudinal resistance and a vanishing Hall resistance, suggesting the presence of particle-hole symmetry. We establish a superconducting Higgs mode in atomically thin samples, which reveals enduring superconducting fluctuations that withstand unexpectedly high reduced magnetic fields. These findings provide evidence of robust locally paired electrons in the anomalous metallic state, affirming its bosonic nature.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Removal of excess iron by annealing processes and emergence of bulk superconductivity in sulfur-substituted FeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several strategies to discover new superconductors. Growing new materials and applying high pressures can be the classic ways since superconductivity was found. Also, chemical processing, such as annealing, is another way to induce superconductivity in a non-superconducting material. Here, we show chemical processing effects in the non-superconducting material, sulfur-substituted FeTe. It has been known that superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe is induced by O$_2$ annealing. We revealed that hydrochloric acid etching and vacuum annealing for O$_2$-annealed samples made the quality of superconductivity higher by several physical property measurements. Furthermore, we visualized the superconducting regions by a magneto-optical imaging technique, indicating that the superconductivity in the processed sample was bulk. In this sample, we confirmed that the concentration of excess iron was reduced compared to that in the as-grown state. These results provide an important route to bulk superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe and its related iron-based compounds.</description>

      <title>Fractional-flux oscillations of Josephson critical currents in multi-gap superconductors: a test for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.</description>

      <title>Detecting Topological Superconductivity via Berry Curvature Effects in Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens (darkens) linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens (brightens) in the trivial phase when the Rashba system is electron- (hole-) doped. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides an experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and pinning by lattice anisotropy in 214 cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of static charge density waves (CDWs) in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with x $\sim$ 0.12 at relatively high temperatures has raised the question of what lattice feature pins the CDWs. Some recent structural studies have concluded that some form of monoclinic distortion, indicated by the appearance of certain weak Bragg peaks (type M peaks) at otherwise forbidden positions, are responsible for CDW pinning. As a test of this idea, we present neutron diffraction results for a single crystal of La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) with x = 1/8, which is known to undergo two structural transitions on cooling, from high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) near 240 K, involving a collective tilt pattern of the corner-sharing CuO$_6$ octahedra, and from LTO to low temperature tetragonal (LTT) near 56 K, involving a new tilt pattern and the appearance of intensity at peaks of type T. We observe both type M and type T peaks in the LTT phase, while the type M peaks (but not type T) are still present in the LTO phase. Given that CDW order is observed only in the LTT phase of LBCO, it is apparent that the in-plane Cu-O bond anisotropy associated with the octahedral tilt pattern is responsible for charge pinning. We point out that evidence for a similar, but weaker, bond anisotropy has been observed previously in LSCO and should be responsible for CDW pinning there. In the case of LBCO, the monoclinic distortion may help to explain previously-reported magneto-optical evidence for gyrotropic order.</description>

      <title>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been limited because of the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we demonstrate that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry, the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. In addition, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the topological regime in elongated Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field, the Josephson junction can enter the topological phase and host zero-energy Majorana bound states over a range of the superconducting phase difference centered around $\pi$, with the span of this range determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</description>
