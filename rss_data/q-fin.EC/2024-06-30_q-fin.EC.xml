      <title>Non-Linearities in International Spillovers of the ECB\textquotesingle s Monetary Policy. The Case of Non-ERM II Countries and Anti-Fragmentation Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of sign and size non-linearities in the impact of the European Central Bank\textquotesingle s Anti-Fragmentation Policy on non-ERM II, EU countries. After identifying three orthogonal monetary policy shock using the method of Fanelli and Marsi [2022], we then select an optimal specification and estimate both linear and non linear impulse response functions using local projections (Dufour and Renault [1998], Goncalves et al. [2021]). The choice of non-linear transformations to separate sign and size effects is based on Caravello and Martinez-Bruera [Working Paper, 2024]. Lastly we compare the linear model to the non-linear ones using a battery of Wald tests and find significant evidence of sign non-linearities in the international spillovers of ECB policy.</description>

      <title>Single Transferable Vote and Paradoxes of Negative and Positive Involvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a type of voting paradox which we term an involvement paradox, in which a candidate who loses an election could be made into a winner if more of the candidate's non-supporters participated in the election, or a winner could be made into a loser if more of the candidate's supporters participated. Such paradoxical outcomes are possible under the voting method of single transferable vote (STV), which is widely used for political elections throughout the world. We provide a worst-case analysis of involvement paradoxes under STV and show several interesting examples of these paradoxes from elections in Scotland.</description>

      <title>Shaping New Norms for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08564v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, the need for new norms is urgent. However, AI evolves at a much faster pace than the characteristic time of norm formation, posing an unprecedented challenge to our societies. This paper examines possible criticalities of the processes of norm formation surrounding AI. Thus, it focuses on how new norms can be established, rather than on what these norms should be. It distinguishes different scenarios based on the centralisation or decentralisation of the norm formation process, analysing the cases where new norms are shaped by formal authorities, informal institutions, or emerge spontaneously in a bottom-up fashion. On the latter point, the paper reports a conversation with ChatGPT in which the LLM discusses some of the emerging norms it has observed. Far from seeking exhaustiveness, this article aims to offer readers interpretive tools to understand society's response to the growing pervasiveness of AI. An outlook on how AI could influence the formation of future social norms emphasises the importance for open societies to anchor their formal deliberation process in an open, inclusive, and transparent public discourse.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic agents as active matter in nonequilibrium Sakoda-Schelling models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How robust are socioeconomic agent-based models with respect to the details of the agents' decision rule? We tackle this question by considering an occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an active matter field description. Finally, we consider non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within a field theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which samples of future time series are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</description>

      <title>FishNet: Deep Neural Networks for Low-Cost Fish Stock Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fish stock assessment often involves manual fish counting by taxonomy specialists, which is both time-consuming and costly. We propose FishNet, an automated computer vision system for both taxonomic classification and fish size estimation from images captured with a low-cost digital camera. The system first performs object detection and segmentation using a Mask R-CNN to identify individual fish from images containing multiple fish, possibly consisting of different species. Then each fish species is classified and the length is predicted using separate machine learning models. To develop the model, we use a dataset of 300,000 hand-labeled images containing 1.2M fish of 163 different species and ranging in length from 10cm to 250cm, with additional annotations and quality control methods used to curate high-quality training data. On held-out test data sets, our system achieves a 92% intersection over union on the fish segmentation task, a 89% top-1 classification accuracy on single fish species classification, and a 2.3cm mean absolute error on the fish length estimation task.</description>
