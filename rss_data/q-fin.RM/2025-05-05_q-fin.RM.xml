      <title>Towards modelling lifetime default risk: Exploring different subtypes of recurrent event Cox-regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of modelling a loan's probability of default (PD) over its lifetime, repeat default events are often ignored when using Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) models. Excluding such events may produce biased and inaccurate PD-estimates, which can compromise financial buffers against future losses. Accordingly, we investigate a few subtypes of Cox-models that can incorporate recurrent default events. Using South African mortgage data, we explore both the Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time models. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores recurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model. Models are evaluated using Harrell's c-statistic, adjusted Cox-Sell residuals, and a novel extension of time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. From these Cox-models, we demonstrate how to derive a portfolio-level term-structure of default risk, which is a series of marginal PD-estimates at each point of the average loan's lifetime. While the TFD- and PWP-models do not differ significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed expectations. Depending on the prevalence of recurrent defaults, one may therefore safely ignore them when estimating lifetime default risk. Accordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in producing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.</description>

      <title>A stochastic Gordon-Loeb model for optimal cybersecurity investment under clustered attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time stochastic model for optimal cybersecurity investment under the threat of cyberattacks. The arrival of attacks is modeled using a Hawkes process, capturing the empirically relevant feature of clustering in cyberattacks. Extending the Gordon-Loeb model, each attack may result in a breach, with breach probability depending on the system's vulnerability. We aim at determining the optimal cybersecurity investment to reduce vulnerability. The problem is cast as a two-dimensional Markovian stochastic optimal control problem and solved using dynamic programming methods. Numerical results illustrate how accounting for attack clustering leads to more responsive and effective investment policies, offering significant improvements over static and Poisson-based benchmark strategies. Our findings underscore the value of incorporating realistic threat dynamics into cybersecurity risk management.</description>

      <title>Assessing solution quality in risk-averse stochastic programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimization problems, the quality of a candidate solution can be characterized by the optimality gap. For most stochastic optimization problems, this gap must be statistically estimated. We show that for risk-averse problems, standard estimators are optimistically biased, which compromises the statistical guarantee on the optimality gap. We introduce estimators for risk-averse problems that do not suffer from this bias. Our method relies on using two independent samples, each estimating a different component of the optimality gap. Our approach extends a broad class of optimality gap estimation methods from the risk-neutral case to the risk-averse case, such as the multiple replications procedure and its one- and two-sample variants. We show that our approach is tractable and leads to high-quality optimality gap estimates for spectral and quadrangle risk measures. Our approach can further make use of existing bias and variance reduction techniques.</description>
