      <title>SB-ETAS: using simulation based inference for scalable, likelihood-free inference for the ETAS model of earthquake occurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing Bayesian inference for the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model of earthquakes typically requires MCMC sampling using the likelihood function or estimating the latent branching structure. These tasks have computational complexity $O(n^2)$ with the number of earthquakes and therefore do not scale well with new enhanced catalogs, which can now contain an order of $10^6$ events. On the other hand, simulation from the ETAS model can be done more quickly $O(n \log n )$. We present SB-ETAS: simulation-based inference for the ETAS model. This is an approximate Bayesian method which uses Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE), a machine learning based algorithm for learning posterior distributions from simulations. SB-ETAS can successfully approximate ETAS posterior distributions on shorter catalogues where it is computationally feasible to compare with MCMC sampling. Furthermore, the scaling of SB-ETAS makes it feasible to fit to very large earthquake catalogs, such as one for Southern California dating back to 1932. SB-ETAS can find Bayesian estimates of ETAS parameters for this catalog in less than 10 hours on a standard laptop, which would have taken over 2 weeks using MCMC. Looking beyond the standard ETAS model, this simulation based framework would allow earthquake modellers to define and infer parameters for much more complex models that have intractable likelihood functions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Information Theoretic and Statistical Methods for Line Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the noise characteristics of phasor measurement units (PMUs) can be more accurately described by non-Gaussian distributions. Consequently, estimation techniques based on Gaussian noise assumptions may produce poor results with PMU data. This paper considers the PMU based line parameter estimation (LPE) problem, and investigates the performance of four state-of-the-art techniques in solving this problem in presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. The rigorous comparative analysis highlights the merits and demerits of each technique w.r.t. the LPE problem, and identifies conditions under which they are expected to give good results.</description>

      <title>Double Robust Variance Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly robust estimators have gained popularity in the field of causal inference due to their ability to provide consistent point estimates when either an outcome or exposure model is correctly specified. However, the influence function based variance estimator frequently used with doubly robust estimators is only consistent when both the outcome and exposure models are correctly specified. Here, use of M-estimation and the empirical sandwich variance estimator for doubly robust point and variance estimation is demonstrated. Simulation studies illustrate the properties of the influence function based and empirical sandwich variance estimators. Estimators are applied to data from the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes with Progesterone (IPOP) trial to estimate the effect of maternal anemia on birth weight among women with HIV. In the example, birth weights if all women had anemia were estimated to be lower than birth weights if no women had anemia, though estimates were imprecise. Variance estimates were more stable under varying model specifications for the empirical sandwich variance estimator than the influence function based variance estimator.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatial Context: A Comprehensive Bibliography of GWR and MGWR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local spatial models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) serve as instrumental tools to capture intrinsic contextual effects through the estimates of the local intercepts and behavioral contextual effects through estimates of the local slope parameters. GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</description>

      <title>Automating the Discovery of Partial Differential Equations in Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from data is crucial for understanding the governing mechanisms of natural phenomena, yet it remains a challenging task. We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Multi-Layer Perceptrons for Wind Farm Condition Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a condition monitoring system for wind farms, based on normal behaviour modelling using a probabilistic multi-layer perceptron with transfer learning via fine-tuning. The model predicts the output power of the wind turbine under normal behaviour based on features retrieved from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Its advantages are that (i) it can be trained with SCADA data of at least a few years, (ii) it can incorporate all SCADA data of all wind turbines in a wind farm as features, (iii) it assumes that the output power follows a normal density with heteroscedastic variance and (iv) it can predict the output of one wind turbine by borrowing strength from the data of all other wind turbines in a farm. Probabilistic guidelines for condition monitoring are given via a CUSUM control chart. We illustrate the performance of our model in a real SCADA data example which provides evidence that it outperforms other probabilistic prediction models.</description>

      <title>Estimating Metocean Environments Associated with Extreme Structural Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme value analysis (EVA) uses data to estimate long-term extreme environmental conditions for variables such as significant wave height and period, for the design of marine structures. Together with models for the short-term evolution of the ocean environment and for wave-structure interaction, EVA provides a basis for full probabilistic design analysis. Environmental contours provide an alternate approach to estimating structural integrity, without requiring structural knowledge. These contour methods also exploit statistical models, including EVA, but avoid the need for structural modelling by making what are believed to be conservative assumptions about the shape of the structural failure boundary in the environment space. These assumptions, however, may not always be appropriate, or may lead to unnecessary wasted resources from over design. We introduce a methodology for full probabilistic analysis to estimate the joint probability density of the environment, conditional on the occurrence of an extreme structural response, for simple structures. We use this conditional density of the environment as a basis to assess the performance of different environmental contour methods. We demonstrate the difficulty of estimating the contour boundary in the environment space for typical data samples, as well as the dependence of the performance of the environmental contour on the structure being considered.</description>

Abstract: Ancestry-specific proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) based on genetically predicted protein expression can reveal complex disease etiology specific to certain ancestral groups. These studies require ancestry-specific models for protein expression as a function of SNP genotypes. In order to improve protein expression prediction in ancestral populations historically underrepresented in genomic studies, we propose a new penalized maximum likelihood estimator for fitting ancestry-specific joint protein quantitative trait loci models. Our estimator borrows information across ancestral groups, while simultaneously allowing for heterogeneous error variances and regression coefficients. We propose an alternative parameterization of our model which makes the objective function convex and the penalty scale invariant. To improve computational efficiency, we propose an approximate version of our method and study its theoretical properties. Our method provides a substantial improvement in protein expression prediction accuracy in individuals of African ancestry, and in a downstream PWAS analysis, leads to the discovery of multiple associations between protein expression and blood lipid traits in the African ancestry population.</description>

      <title>An adaptive standardisation methodology for Day-Ahead electricity price forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate five distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all five markets using the widely accepted learning algorithms in the literature (LEAR and DNN). In particular, the combination of the proposed methodology with the methodology previously presented in the literature obtains the best results. This significant advancement unveils new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Seasonal and Periodic Patterns of PM2.5 in Manhattan using the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air quality is a critical component of environmental health. Monitoring and analysis of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) plays a pivotal role in understanding air quality changes. This study focuses on the application of a new bandpass bootstrap approach, termed the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB), for analyzing time series data which provides modeled predictions of daily mean PM2.5 concentrations over 16 years in Manhattan, New York, the United States. The VBPBB can be used to explore periodically correlated (PC) principal components for this daily mean PM2.5 dataset. This method uses bandpass filters to isolate distinct PC components from datasets, removing unwanted interference including noise, and bootstraps the PC components. This preserves the PC structure and permits a better understanding of the periodic characteristics of time series data. The results of the VBPBB are compared against outcomes from alternative block bootstrapping techniques. The findings of this research indicate potential trends of elevated PM2.5 levels, providing evidence of significant semi-annual and weekly patterns missed by other methods.</description>

      <title>Direct covariance matrix estimation with compositional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional data arise in many areas of research in the natural and biomedical sciences. One prominent example is in the study of the human gut microbiome, where one can measure the relative abundance of many distinct microorganisms in a subject's gut. Often, practitioners are interested in learning how the dependencies between microbes vary across distinct populations or experimental conditions. In statistical terms, the goal is to estimate a covariance matrix for the (latent) log-abundances of the microbes in each of the populations. However, the compositional nature of the data prevents the use of standard estimators for these covariance matrices. In this article, we propose an estimator of multiple covariance matrices which allows for information sharing across distinct populations of samples. Compared to some existing estimators, which estimate the covariance matrices of interest indirectly, our estimator is direct, ensures positive definiteness, and is the solution to a convex optimization problem. We compute our estimator using a proximal-proximal gradient descent algorithm. Asymptotic properties of our estimator reveal that it can perform well in high-dimensional settings. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our estimator can outperform existing estimators. We show that our method provides more reliable estimates than competitors in an analysis of microbiome data from subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome.</description>

      <title>covXtreme : MATLAB software for non-stationary penalised piecewise constant marginal and conditional extreme value models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covXtreme software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest. The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed in MATLAB for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold. The software and case study data can be downloaded from GitHub, with an accompanying user guide.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Changes Are Not Enough: Evaluating the Removal of Race Adjustment from the eGFR Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changing clinical algorithms to remove race adjustment has been proposed and implemented for multiple health conditions. Removing race adjustment from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations may reduce disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but has not been studied in clinical practice after implementation. Here, we assessed whether implementing an eGFR equation (CKD-EPI 2021) without adjustment for Black or African American race modified quarterly rates of nephrology referrals and visits within a single healthcare system, Stanford Health Care (SHC). Our cohort study analyzed 547,194 adult patients aged 21 and older who had at least one recorded serum creatinine or serum cystatin C between January 1, 2019 and September 1, 2023. During the study period, implementation of CKD-EPI 2021 did not modify rates of quarterly nephrology referrals in those documented as Black or African American or in the overall cohort. After adjusting for capacity at SHC nephrology clinics, estimated rates of nephrology referrals and visits with CKD-EPI 2021 were 34 (95% CI 29, 39) and 188 (175, 201) per 10,000 patients documented as Black or African American. If race adjustment had not been removed, estimated rates were nearly identical: 38 (95% CI: 28, 53) and 189 (165, 218) per 10,000 patients. Changes to the eGFR equation are likely insufficient to achieve health equity in CKD care decision-making as many other structural inequities remain.</description>
