      <title>Composite Numbers in an Arithmetic Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One challenge (or opportunity!) that many instructors face is how varied the backgrounds, abilities, and interests of students are. In order to simultaneously instill confidence in those with weaker preparations and still challenge those able to go faster, an instructor must be prepared to give problems of different difficulty levels. Using Dirichlet's Theorem as a case study, we create and discuss a family of problems in number theory that highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of different ways to approach a question and show how to invite students to extend the problems and explore research-level mathematics.</description>

      <title>Supplementary Private Tutoring and Mathematical Achievements in Higher Education: An Empirical Study on Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article is an empirical study that investigates the learning situation of linear algebra. Research was performed among 60 science and engineering students from different universities in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shandong who were taught by three mathematics teachers in the course of a 3-day short-term training consisting of 24 classes; following this, the effectiveness of short-term training for mathematics curriculum learning in higher education was evaluated based on the IRT measurement model. The results indicate that regardless of the difficulty of the test, short-term training significantly enhances students' mastery of linear algebra knowledge points, and students can accurately perceive their mathematical achievements; the effect observed is not consistent with that of private tutoring (PT) in primary and secondary schools.</description>
