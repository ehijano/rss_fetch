      <title>Quantifying "just-right" APC inactivation for colorectal cancer initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysregulation of the tumour suppressor gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is a canonical step in colorectal cancer development. Curiously, most colorectal tumours carry biallelic mutations that result in only partial loss of APC function, suggesting that a "just-right" level of APC inactivation, and hence Wnt signalling, provides the optimal conditions for tumorigenesis. Mutational processes act variably across the APC gene, which could contribute to the bias against complete APC inactivation. Thus the selective consequences of partial APC loss are unclear. Here we propose a mathematical model to quantify the tumorigenic effect of biallelic APC genotypes, controlling for somatic mutational processes. Analysing sequence data from &gt;2500 colorectal cancers, we find that APC genotypes resulting in partial protein function confer about 50 times higher probability of progressing to cancer compared to complete APC inactivation. The optimal inactivation level varies with anatomical location and additional mutations of Wnt pathway regulators. We use this context dependency to assess the regulatory effect of secondary Wnt drivers in combination with APC in vivo, and provide evidence that mutant AMER1 combines with APC genotypes that lead to relatively low Wnt. The fitness landscape of APC inactivation is consistent across microsatellite unstable and POLE-deficient colorectal cancers and tumours in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, suggesting a general "just-right" optimum, and pointing to Wnt hyperactivation as a potential cancer vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Training-free CryoET Tomogram Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) is a useful imaging technology in structural biology that is hindered by its need for manual annotations, especially in particle picking. Recent works have endeavored to remedy this issue with few-shot learning or contrastive learning techniques. However, supervised training is still inevitable for them. We instead choose to leverage the power of existing 2D foundation models and present a novel, training-free framework, CryoSAM. In addition to prompt-based single-particle instance segmentation, our approach can automatically search for similar features, facilitating full tomogram semantic segmentation with only one prompt. CryoSAM is composed of two major parts: 1) a prompt-based 3D segmentation system that uses prompts to complete single-particle instance segmentation recursively with Cross-Plane Self-Prompting, and 2) a Hierarchical Feature Matching mechanism that efficiently matches relevant features with extracted tomogram features. They collaborate to enable the segmentation of all particles of one category with just one particle-specific prompt. Our experiments show that CryoSAM outperforms existing works by a significant margin and requires even fewer annotations in particle picking. Further visualizations demonstrate its ability when dealing with full tomogram segmentation for various subcellular structures. Our code is available at: https://github.com/xulabs/aitom</description>

      <title>Double-Ended Synthesis Planning with Goal-Constrained Bidirectional Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms have demonstrated expert-level abilities in planning retrosynthetic routes to molecules of low to moderate complexity. However, current search methods assume the sufficiency of reaching arbitrary building blocks, failing to address the common real-world constraint where using specific molecules is desired. To this end, we present a formulation of synthesis planning with starting material constraints. Under this formulation, we propose Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), a novel CASP algorithm under a bidirectional graph search scheme that interleaves expansions from the target and from the goal starting materials to ensure constraint satisfiability. The search algorithm is guided by a goal-conditioned cost network learned offline from a partially observed hypergraph of valid chemical reactions. We demonstrate the utility of DESP in improving solve rates and reducing the number of search expansions by biasing synthesis planning towards expert goals on multiple new benchmarks. DESP can make use of existing one-step retrosynthesis models, and we anticipate its performance to scale as these one-step model capabilities improve.</description>

      <title>Shifts in Brain Dynamics and Drivers of Consciousness State Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the transitions between different states of consciousness is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Thus, we investigate the underlying drivers of changes during the resting-state dynamics of the human brain, as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) across varying levels of consciousness (awake, light sedation, deep sedation, and recovery). We deploy a model-based approach relying on linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems under unknown inputs (UI). Our findings reveal distinct changes in the spectral profile of brain dynamics - particularly regarding the stability and frequency of the system's oscillatory modes during transitions between consciousness states. These models further enable us to identify external drivers influencing large-scale brain activity during naturalistic auditory stimulation. Our findings suggest that these identified inputs delineate how stimulus-induced co-activity propagation differs across consciousness states. Notably, our approach showcases the effectiveness of LTI models under UI in capturing large-scale brain dynamic changes and drivers in complex paradigms, such as naturalistic stimulation, which are not conducive to conventional general linear model analysis. Importantly, our findings shed light on how brain-wide dynamics and drivers evolve as the brain transitions towards conscious states, holding promise for developing more accurate biomarkers of consciousness recovery in disorders of consciousness.</description>

      <title>Can virtual staining for high-throughput screening generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified Python package for the prediction of protein biophysical properties, streamlining previous tools developed by the Bio2Byte research group. This suite facilitates comprehensive assessments of protein characteristics, incorporating predictors for backbone and sidechain dynamics, local secondary structure propensities, early folding, long disorder, beta-sheet aggregation and FUS-like phase separation. Our package significantly eases the integration and execution of these tools, enhancing accessibility for both computational and experimental researchers.</description>

      <title>Resting state fMRI-based temporal coherence mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range temporal coherence (LRTC) is quite common to dynamic systems and is fundamental to the system function. LRTC in the brain has been shown to be important to cognition. Assessing LRTC may provide critical information for understanding the potential underpinnings of brain organization, function, and cognition. To facilitate this overarching goal, we provide a method, which is named temporal coherence mapping (TCM), to explicitly quantify LRTC using resting state fMRI. TCM is based on correlation analysis of the transit states of the phase space reconstructed by temporal embedding. A few TCM properties were collected to measure LRTC, including the averaged correlation, anti-correlation, the ratio of correlation and anticorrelation, the mean coherent and incoherent duration, and the ratio between the coherent and incoherent time. TCM was first evaluated with simulations and then with the large Human Connectome Project data. Evaluation results showed that TCM metrics can successfully differentiate signals with different temporal coherence regardless of the parameters used to reconstruct the phase space. In human brain, TCM metrics except the ratio of the coherent/incoherent time showed high test-retest reproducibility; TCM metrics are related to age, sex, and total cognitive scores. In summary, TCM provides a first-of-its-kind tool to assess LRTC and the imbalance between coherence and incoherence; TCM properties are physiologically and cognitively meaningful.</description>

      <title>Medication Recommendation via Dual Molecular Modalities and Multi-Substructure Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medication recommendation combines patient medical history with biomedical knowledge to assist doctors in determining medication combinations more accurately and safely. Existing works based on molecular knowledge neglect the 3D geometric structure of molecules and fail to learn the high-dimensional information of medications, leading to structural confusion. Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs and re-evaluating substructures at the visit level. Specifically, we use deep learning networks to construct a pretraining method that acquires 2D and 3D molecular structure representations and substructure representations, and obtain mutual information through contrastive learning. We then generate fused molecular representations using the trained GNN module and re-determine the relevance of substructure representations in combination with the patient's clinical history. Finally, we generate the final medication combination based on the extracted substructure sequences. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the second-best baseline, our model improves accuracy by 2.07%, with DDI at the same level as the baseline.</description>

      <title>CS3: Cascade SAM for Sperm Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated sperm morphology analysis plays a crucial role in the assessment of male fertility, yet its efficacy is often compromised by the challenges in accurately segmenting sperm images. Existing segmentation techniques, including the Segment Anything Model(SAM), are notably inadequate in addressing the complex issue of sperm overlap-a frequent occurrence in clinical samples. Our exploratory studies reveal that modifying image characteristics by removing sperm heads and easily segmentable areas, alongside enhancing the visibility of overlapping regions, markedly enhances SAM's efficiency in segmenting intricate sperm structures. Motivated by these findings, we present the Cascade SAM for Sperm Segmentation (CS3), an unsupervised approach specifically designed to tackle the issue of sperm overlap. This method employs a cascade application of SAM to segment sperm heads, simple tails, and complex tails in stages. Subsequently, these segmented masks are meticulously matched and joined to construct complete sperm masks. In collaboration with leading medical institutions, we have compiled a dataset comprising approximately 2,000 unlabeled sperm images to fine-tune our method, and secured expert annotations for an additional 240 images to facilitate comprehensive model assessment. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of CS3 compared to existing methods.</description>
