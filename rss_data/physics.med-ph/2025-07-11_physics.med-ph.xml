      <title>Subject grounding to reduce electromagnetic interference for MRI scanners operating in unshielded environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose. Portable low-field (&lt; 0.1 T) MRI is increasingly used for point-of-care imaging, but electromagnetic interference (EMI) presents a significant challenge, especially in unshielded environments. EMI can degrade image quality and compromise diagnostic utility. This study investigates whether subject grounding can effectively reduce EMI and improve image quality, comparing different grounding strategies. Methods. Experiments were conducted using a 47 mT Halbach-based MRI scanner with a single receive channel. Reproducibility was evaluated at a second site using a 72 mT scanner with similar geometry. Turbo spin echo sequences were used to image the hand and brain. Subject grounding was implemented using conductive cloth sleeves or ECG electrodes, each connected between the subject's skin and scanner ground. Three EMI conditions were tested: ambient, added single-frequency EMI, and broadband EMI. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were calculated under each configuration. Results. Subject grounding significantly reduced EMI in both hand and brain scans. In hand imaging, conductive sleeves reduced noise from 85x to 1.25x the 50-ohm noise floor. In brain imaging, grounding alone reduced noise from 55x to 25x baseline; when combined with arc RF shields, noise was further reduced to 1.2x baseline, even under added EMI. These results were reproducible across different scanners and locations. Conclusion. Subject grounding is a simple, effective, and reproducible strategy for mitigating EMI in portable low-field MRI. It is especially effective for hand imaging, while brain imaging benefits from additional RF shielding. The approach is robust under various EMI conditions and may complement other denoising techniques.</description>

      <title>SynthAorta: A 3D Mesh Dataset of Parametrized Physiological Healthy Aortas</title>

Abstract: The effects of the aortic geometry on its mechanics and blood flow, and subsequently on aortic pathologies, remain largely unexplored. The main obstacle lies in obtaining patient-specific aorta models, an extremely difficult procedure in terms of ethics and availability, segmentation, mesh generation, and all of the accompanying processes. Contrastingly, idealized models are easy to build but do not faithfully represent patient-specific variability. Additionally, a unified aortic parametrization in clinic and engineering has not yet been achieved. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new set of statistical parameters to generate synthetic models of the aorta. The parameters possess geometric significance and fall within physiological ranges, effectively bridging the disciplines of clinical medicine and engineering. Smoothly blended realistic representations are recovered with convolution surfaces. These enable high-quality visualization and biological appearance, whereas the structured mesh generation paves the way for numerical simulations. The only requirement of the approach is one patient-specific aorta model and the statistical data for parameter values obtained from the literature. The output of this work is SynthAorta, a dataset of ready-to-use synthetic, physiological aorta models, each containing a centerline, surface representation, and a structured hexahedral finite element mesh. The meshes are structured and fully consistent between different cases, making them imminently suitable for reduced order modeling and machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-dynamic deep image prior for cardiac MRI</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac structure and function. However, traditional breath-held imaging protocols pose challenges for patients with arrhythmias or limited breath-holding capacity. This work aims to overcome these limitations by developing a reconstruction framework that enables high-quality imaging in free-breathing conditions for various dynamic cardiac MRI protocols. Multi-Dynamic Deep Image Prior (M-DIP), a novel unsupervised reconstruction framework for accelerated real-time cardiac MRI, is introduced. To capture contrast or content variation, M-DIP first employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent intermediate image. Then, this intermediate image is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications. We validate M-DIP using simulated MRXCAT cine phantom data as well as free-breathing real-time cine, single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and first-pass perfusion data from clinical patients. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches demonstrate M-DIP's performance and versatility. M-DIP achieved better image quality metrics on phantom data, higher reader scores on in-vivo cine and LGE data, and comparable scores on in-vivo perfusion data relative to another DIP-based approach. M-DIP enables high-quality reconstructions of real-time free-breathing cardiac MRI without requiring external training data. Its ability to model physiological motion and content variations makes it a promising approach for various dynamic imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A Digital Phantom for MR Spectroscopy Data Simulation</title>

Abstract: Simulated data is increasingly valued by researchers for validating MRS processing and analysis algorithms. However, there is no consensus on the optimal approaches for simulation models and parameters. This study introduces a novel MRS digital brain phantom framework, providing a comprehensive and modular foundation for MRS data simulation. The framework generates a digital brain phantom by combining anatomical and tissue label information with metabolite data from the literature. This phantom contains all necessary information for simulating spectral data. The MRS phantom is combined with a signal-based model to demonstrate its functionality and usability in generating various spectral datasets. Outputs can be saved in the NIfTI-MRS format, enabling their use in downstream applications. To evaluate the realism of the simulated spectra, a comparison was performed against in-vivo MRS data acquired under similar conditions. The phantom was implemented using two anatomical templates at different resolutions and tested across a range of user-defined simulation parameters. Simulated spectra exhibited realistic signal characteristics and structural variability. When compared to in-vivo data, the simulated spectra closely matched in terms of spectral shape, signal-to-noise ratio, and metabolite quantification. The simulations also captured key variability features and provided additional diversity not present in the in-vivo dataset, supporting use in robustness testing and data augmentation. This novel digital phantom provides a flexible and extensible platform for MRS data simulation. Its modular architecture, user-friendly GUI, and open-source implementation support reproducible research, algorithm development, and validation in the MRS community.</description>

      <title>Integrated Open-Source Framework for Simulation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Native Right Ventricular Outflow Tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.
  Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.
  Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.
  Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.</description>
