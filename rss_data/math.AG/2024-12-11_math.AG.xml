      <title>On two families of Enriques categories over K3 surfaecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the moduli spaces of semistable objects related to two families of Enriques categories over K3 surfaces, coming from quartic double solids and special Gushel--Mukai threefolds. In particular, classic geometric constructions are recovered in a modular way, such as the double EPW sextic and cube associated with a general Gushel--Mukai surface, and the Beauville's birational involution on the Hilbert scheme of two points on a quartic K3 surface. In addition, we describe the singular loci in some moduli spaces of semistable objects and an explicit birational involutions on an O'Grady's hyperk\"ahler tenfold.</description>

      <title>Pencils of Conic-Line Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the restrictions on the number $m$ of conic-line curves in special pencils. The most general result we obtain is an upper bound on $m$: it cannot exceed 6. We construct a one-parameter family of pencils such that each pencil in the family contains exactly 4 conic-line curves. We also deal with pencils whose conic-line curves are in general position.</description>

      <title>The tropical Abel--Prym map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the tropical Abel--Prym map $\Psi\colon \tGa\to\Prym(\tGa/\Ga)$ associated with a free double cover $\pi\colon \tGa\to \Ga$ of hyperelliptic metric graphs is harmonic of degree $2$ in accordance with the already established algebraic result. We then prove a partial converse. Contrary to the analogous algebraic result, when the source graph of the double cover is not hyperelliptic, the Abel--Prym map is often not injective.
  When the source graph is hyperelliptic, we show that the Abel--Prym graph $\Psi(\tGa)$ is a hyperelliptic metric graph of genus $g_{\Ga}-1$ whose Jacobian is isomorphic, as pptav, to the Prym variety of the cover. En route,
  we count the number of distinct free double covers by hyperelliptic metric graphs.</description>

      <title>On Picard Number and Dimension of Algebraic Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic variety $X$ is called a homogeneous space if there exists a transitive regular action of an algebraic group on $X$. In the case when $X$ is an affine or projective homogeneous space for a simple or, more generally, semisimple group, we prove inequalities between the dimension of $X$ and its Picard number.</description>

      <title>Global variations of Hodge structures of maximal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new bound on the dimension of images of period maps of global pure polarized integral variations of Hodge structures with generic Hodge datum of level at least 3. When the generic Mumford-Tate domain of the variation is a period domain parametrizing Hodge structures with given Hodge numbers, we prove that the new bound is at worst linear in the Hodge numbers, while previous known bounds were quadratic. We also give an example where our bound is significantly better than previous ones and sharp in the sense that there is a variation of geometric origin whose period image has maximal dimension (i.e. equal to the new bound).</description>

      <title>Mather-Yau's type theorem for higher Nash blowup algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Mather-Yau theorem for higher Nash blowup algebras, demonstrating that the isomorphism type of the local ring of any hypersurface singularity, defined over an arbitrary field, is fully determined by its higher Nash blowup algebras. The classical Mather-Yau theorem (1982) asserts that for isolated complex hypersurface singularities, the isomorphism type of the local ring is determined by the Tjurina algebra. In positive characteristic, this result was extended by considering the higher Tjurina algebras by Greuel and Pham (2017) under the assumptions of an algebraically closed ground field and isolated singularities. Our work begins by proving the stability of higher Nash blowup algebras under contact equivalence in a very general framework. Specifically, we show that the higher Nash blowup algebras of any system of elements in an analytic or geometric ring remain invariant under contact equivalence. For complex hypersurface singularities, this stability was conjectured by Hussain, Ma, Yau, and Zuo, and was recently verified by Le and Yasuda. Finally, the converse is established using a classical result of Samuel (1956).</description>

      <title>Loop torsors. Theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop torsors over Laurent polynomial rings in characteristic 0 were originally introduced in relation to infinite dimensional Lie theory. Applications to other areas require a theory that can yields results in positive characteristic, and for group schemes that are not of finite type. The relation between loop and so-called toral torsors, is one of the central questions in the area. The present paper addresses this question in full generality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of a two-valued algebraic group structure on a complex plane and complex projective line is developed. In this theory, depending on the choice of the neutral element, the local multiplication law is given by the Buchstaber polynomial or the generalized Kontsevich polynomial. One of the most exciting results of our studies is a simple construction of a two-valued algebraic group on $\mathbb C$ different from known coset-construction.</description>

      <title>How to split two-dimensional Jacobians: a geometric construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi\colon Y \to X$ be a branched cover of complex algebraic curves of respective genera $g(Y)=2$ and $g(X)=1$. The Jacobian of $Y$ is isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves: $\operatorname{Jac} Y \sim \operatorname{Jac} X \times \operatorname{Jac} W$. We present an explicit geometric construction of the complementary curve $W$. Furthermore, we establish a criterion to decide whether an algebraic correspondence of curves admits a push-out.</description>

      <title>On the structure of open del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,D)$ be an open log del Pezzo surface of rank one, that is, $X$ is a normal projective surface of Picard rank one, and the boundary $D$ is a reduced, nonzero divisor on $X$. We show that, up to well described exceptions in characteristics 2, 3 and 5, the open part $X\setminus D$ admits an $\mathbb{A}^1$- or $\mathbb{A}^1_*$-fibration with no base points on the boundary of the minimal log resolution of $(X,D)$. In characteristic 0, this improves a well-known structure theorem of Miyanishi-Tsunoda. Within the proof, we classify rational anti-canonical curves contained in smooth loci of canonical del Pezzo surfaces of rank one.</description>

      <title>Lines, Twisted Cubics on Cubic Fourfolds, and the Monodromy of the Voisin Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a cubic fourfold $ Y $ with associated Fano variety of lines $ F $, we establish several properties of the finite-degree 16 self-rational map $ \psi \colon F \dashrightarrow F $ introduced by Voisin. We begin by analyzing the singularities of the nodal quintic with 16 nodes associated with a general line under the specialization to a line in the branch locus of $ \psi $. This approach reveals that the ramification of the natural resolution of indeterminacy of $ \psi $ is simple. The main part of the paper focuses on the intriguing interplay between $ \psi $ and the fixed locus of the antisymplectic involution on the LLSvS variety $ Z $, examined via the degree 6 Voisin map $ F \times F \dashrightarrow Z $. As an application, we show that the monodromy of $ \psi $ is maximal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this article the study of the deformations of a Calabi-Yau type foliations $\mathcal{F}$. For three different types of deformations (unfoldings, holomorphic, transversally holomorphic) there exist Kuranishi spaces $K^f,K^h,K^{tr}$ parametrizing the corresponding families of deformations. We show that $K^f$ is smooth, and that we can obtain $K^h$ as the product $K^f\times K^{tr}$. At last, we show that we can see the $f$-deformations of $\mathcal{F}$ as the $tr$-deformations of a supplementary foliation $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Whittaker normalization of $p$-adic ABV-packets and Vogan's conjecture for tempered representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ABV-packets for $p$-adic groups do not depend on the choice of a Whittaker datum, but the function from the ABV-packet to representations of the appropriate microlocal equivariant fundamental group does, and we find this dependence exactly. We study the relation between open parameters and tempered parameters and Arthur parameters and generic representations. We state a genericity conjecture for ABV-packets and prove this conjecture for quasi-split classical groups and their pure inner forms. Motivated by this we study ABV-packets for open parameters and prove that they are L-packets, and further that the function from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized vanishing cycles coincides with the one given by the Langlands correspondence. From this conclude Vogan's conjecture on A-packets for tempered representations: ABV-packets for tempered parameters are Arthur packets and the function from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized vanishing cycles coincides with the one given by Arthur.</description>

Abstract: Using hyperbolic localization, we identify the nearby cycles along the Vinberg degeneration with the composition of Radon and Harish-Chandra functors, both considered for the category of character sheaves. This provides a new, simple proof of the exactness of this composition, extending previously known results to arbitrary monodromy and more general sheaf-theoretic set-ups.</description>

      <title>BPS Dendroscopy on Local $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BPS states in type II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold can typically be decomposed as moduli-dependent bound states of absolutely stable constituents, with a hierarchical structure labelled by attractor flow trees. This decomposition is best understood from the scattering diagram, an arrangement of real codimension-one loci (or rays) in the space of stability conditions where BPS states of given electromagnetic charge and fixed phase of the central charge exist. The consistency of the diagram when rays intersect determines all BPS indices in terms of the `attractor indices' carried by the initial rays. In this work we study the scattering diagram for a non-compact toric CY threefold known as local $\mathbb{F}_0$, namely the total space of the canonical bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We first construct the scattering diagram for the quiver, valid near the orbifold point, and for the large volume slice, valid when both $\mathbb{P}^1$'s have large (and nearly equal) area. We then combine the insights gained from these simple limits to construct the scattering diagram along the physical slice of $\Pi$-stability conditions, which carries an action of a $\mathbb{Z}^4$ extension of the modular group $\Gamma_0(4)$. We sketch a proof of the Split Attractor Flow Tree Conjecture in this example, albeit for a restricted range of the central charge phase. Most arguments are similar to our early study of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ [arXiv:2210.10712], but complicated by the occurence of an extra mass parameter and ramification points on the $\Pi$-stability slice.</description>

      <title>A Simple Recursion for the Mirzakhani Volume and its Super Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.04458v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a simple recursion formula for the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries. This formula demonstrates the polynomiality of the volume functions. By constructing the Laplace transform for both the original and our alternative formulas, we show that they are directly equivalent. By considering the top and lowest degree terms of these formulas, we recover the DVV identity and cohomology class identities for $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. Similar conclusions are drawn for the super-analog of these results.</description>

      <title>Flat quasi-coherent sheaves as directed colimits, and quasi-coherent cotorsion periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every flat quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme is a directed colimit of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves. More generally, the same assertion holds for any countably quasi-compact, countably quasi-separated scheme. Moreover, for three categories of complexes of flat quasi-coherent sheaves, we show that all complexes in the category can be obtained as directed colimits of complexes of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves from the same category. In particular, on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme, every flat quasi-coherent sheaf is a directed colimit of flat quasi-coherent sheaves of finite projective dimension. In the second part of the paper, we discuss cotorsion periodicity in category-theoretic context, generalizing an argument of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada. As the main application, we deduce the assertion that any cotorsion-periodic quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme is cotorsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explicit solution to Zariski's moduli problem for plane branches. We compute (in an algorithmic way) the set of K\"{a}hler differentials of an irreducible germ of holomorphic plane curve. We show that there is a basis of this set whose main elements correspond to dicritical foliations. Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described. Moreover, we give an algorithmic construction of the bases.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of loop torsors under certain group  schemes defined over the localization of a regularhenselian ring A at a strict normal crossing divisor D. We provide a Galois cohomological criterion for classifying those torsors. We revisit also the  related theory of loop torsors on Laurent polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of quantized barycenters of lattice polytopes with applications to algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses a combinatorial problem with applications to algebraic geometry. To a convex lattice polytope $P$ and each of its integer dilations $kP$ one may associate the barycenter of its lattice points. This sequence of $k$-quantized barycenters converge to the (classical) barycenter of the polytope considered as a convex body. A basic question arises: is there a complete asymptotic expansion for this sequence? If so, what are its terms? This article initiates the study of this question. First, we establish the existence of such an expansion as well as determine the first two terms. Second, for Delzant lattice polytopes we use toric algebra to determine all terms using mixed volumes of virtual rooftop polytopes, or alternatively in terms of higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants. Third, for reflexive polytopes we show the quantized barycenters are colinear to first order, and actually colinear in the case of polygons. The proofs use Ehrhart theory, convexity arguments, and toric algebra. As applications we derive the complete asymptotic expansion of the Fujita--Odaka stability thresholds $\delta_k$ on arbitrary polarizations on (possibly singular) toric varieties. In fact, we show they are rational functions of $k$ for sufficiently large $k$. This gives the first general result on Tian's stabilization problem for $\delta_k$-invariants for (possibly singular) toric Fanos: $\delta_k$ stabilize in $k$ if and only if they are all equal to $1$, and when smooth if and only if asymptotically Chow semistable. We also relate the asymptotic expansions to higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants of test configurations motivated by Ehrhart theory, and unify in passing previous results of Donaldson, Ono, Futaki, and Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\rm k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connect, reductive group over it. Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of complexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$ with integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula of anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\mathbb Q$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion of uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we describe a prenormal form for the generators of the semigroup of a toric variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^p$ with isolated singularity at the origin and smooth normalization. A complete description of the semigroup is given when $X$ is a variety of dimension $n$ in $\mathbb{C}^{2n}$. Moreover, for toric surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, we provide a set of generators of the ideal $I$ defining $X$.</description>

Abstract: For a Fano threefold admitting a full exceptional collection of vector bundles of length four we show that all full exceptional collections consist of shifted vector bundles. We prove this via a detailed study of the group generated by spherical twists on an anticanonical divisor. For example, we prove that this group is free and provide explicit generators.</description>

      <title>Rational distances from given rational points in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study sets of points in the plane with rational distances from r prescribed points P_1, ...,P_r. A crucial case arises for r = 3, where we provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the density of this set in the real topology. We show in the Main Theorem that these conditions can be checked effectively (via congruences), proving that a related class of K3 surfaces satisfies the local-global principle. In particular, these conditions are always satisfied when P_1, P_2, P_3 are rational. This result completes and goes beyond the analysis of Berry, who worked under stronger assumptions, not always fulfilled for instance in all the cases where P_1, P_2, P_3 are rational. On the other hand, for r\ge 4, we show that points with rational distances correspond to rational points in a surface of general type, hence conjecturally not Zariski dense. However, at the present, we lack methods to prove this, given the fact that the surface is simply-connected, as we shall show. We give explicit proofs as well as describe in detail the geometry of the surfaces involved. In addition we discuss certain analogues for points with distances in certain ring of integers.</description>
