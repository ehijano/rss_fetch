      <title>Designing lattice spin models and magnon gaps with supercurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and magnon gaps without dissipative currents.</description>

      <title>Nesting-driven ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model. Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases are studied.</description>

      <title>Beyond ensemble averaging: Parallelized single-shot readout of hole capture in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields, and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic-scaling localization in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial localization of quantum states is one of the focal points in condensed matter physics and quantum simulations, as it signatures profound physics such as nontrivial band topology and non-reciprocal non-Hermiticity. Yet, in higher dimensions, characterizing state localization becomes elusive due to the sophisticated interplay between different localization mechanisms and spacial geometries. In this work, we unveil an exotic type of localization phenomenon in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, termed anisotropic-scaling localization (ASL), where localization lengths follow distinct size-dependent scaling rules in an anisotropic manner. Assisted with both analytical solution and numerical simulation, we find that ASL can emerge from two different mechanisms of effective bulk couplings or one-dimensional junction between different 1D edges, depending on how non-reciprocity is introduced to the system. The competition between ASL states and edge non-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real eigenenergies, respectively. Our results resolve the subtle co-existence of loop-like spectrum and skin-like localization of boundary states in contemporary literature, and provide a framework to classify the intricate higher-order non- Hermitian localization regarding their localization profiles.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations of valley current driven by microwave irradiation in transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnet hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study spin and valley transport in a TMDC/ferromagnet heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. We find that microwave-driven spin pumping induces a valley-selective spin excitation, a direct consequence of the valley-asymmetric Landau levels in the TMDC conduction band. This process generates a pure valley current which, as our central finding, exhibits pronounced quantum oscillations as a function of chemical potential. These oscillations provide a definitive experimental signature of the quantized valley states and establish a new pathway to interface spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Shock absorption by multilayer carbon nanotube packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of transverse impact energy in a multilayer packing (in an array) of parallel single-walled carbon nanotubes has been simulated. It has been shown that such nanotube arrays are effective shock absorbers. The depreciation effect is most pronounced for packings of nanotubes with a diameter of 2.7-3.9 nm. Here, part of the impact energy is absorbed due to the transfer of the packing to a higher energy stationary state, in which part of the nanotubes is in a collapsed state. The impact impulse reaches the other edge of the packing most weakened and distributed over time. For nanotubes with a smaller diameter, the compression of the array occurs elastically without energy accumulation, and for nanotubes with a larger diameter - with energy release.</description>

      <title>Controlling the magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films from Cr$_x$(Bi$_y\,$Sb$_{1-y}$)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ via molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a systematic in-depth study of how we can alter the magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films by tuning the parameters of the molecular beam epitaxy. First, we show how a varying substrate temperature changes the surface morphology and when chosen properly leads to a high crystal quality. Next, the effect of the chromium concentration on the film roughness and crystal quality is investigated. Finally, both the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration are investigated with respect to their effect on the magneto-transport properties of the magnetic topological insulator thin films. It becomes apparent that the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration can be used to tune the Fermi level of the film which allows to make the material intrinsically charge neutral. A very low chromium concentration furthermore allows to tune the magnetic topological insulator into a regime where strong superconducting correlations can be expected when combining the material with a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Local control of parity and charge in nanoscale superconducting lead islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small superconducting islands can exhibit charge quantization, where Coulomb interactions compete with Cooper pairing. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we probe this interplay by measuring the charging energy ($E_C$) and the pairing energy ($\Delta$) of individual nano-islands. Below a critical island size, where $E_C &gt; \Delta$, we observe a crossover between even and odd parity ground states. By applying controlled voltage pulses, we continuously tune the island's electrostatic potential and map the full charge-parity landscape. These results demonstrate tunable superconducting ground states, offering a potential platform for qubit design and control.</description>

      <title>Light-hole states and hyperfine interaction in electrically-defined Ge/GeSn quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12249v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable heavy fermion and quantum criticality in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator (LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous High-Fidelity Single-Qubit Gates in a Spin Qubit Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing due to their compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication and the recent scaling to multi-qubit devices. Control fidelities above the 99% fault-tolerant threshold are routinely achieved, but extending high-fidelity control to simultaneous multi-qubit operation remains a major challenge. We demonstrate high-fidelity, fully parallel control of five silicon spin qubits using a single shared microwave line. Using tailored control pulses, all qubits achieve primitive $\pi/2$ gate fidelities well above 99.99%, with some approaching 99.999%, exceeding previously reported fidelities in silicon spin qubits. These fidelities are mostly preserved during simultaneous operation of up to three qubits, and remain at the practical fault-tolerant threshold of 99.9% even during fully parallel five-qubit operation. This performance is enabled by a calibration scheme that compensates drive-induced phase shifts using only pairwise calibrations, scaling quadratically with qubit number and avoiding exponential overhead. By reducing the number of impedance-controlled microwave lines, our approach addresses a key architectural bottleneck and offers a scalable control strategy for high-fidelity operation in large spin qubit arrays.</description>

Abstract: Berry monopoles-quantized sources of Berry curvature-are fundamental to topological phases, yet their scattering remains unexplored. Here, we report for the first time the adiabatic scattering of Berry monopoles in a bilayer photonic crystal slab combining one genuine and one synthetic momentum. Two monopoles approach, collide, and scatter within this hybrid parameter space. The process is described by an effective coupled-mode model and confirmed by full-wave simulations. We further propose an experimental scheme using chiral edge states, opening a route to probe monopole interactions in synthetic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Optical and electrical probing of plasmonic metal-molecule interactions</title>

Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition. Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number, non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied. The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression, which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers from first principles. Specifically, we compute the transverse flexoelectric coefficients of 126 MXene monolayers along their two principal directions using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The values span a wide range from 0.19$e$ to 1.3$e$ and are nearly isotropic with respect to bending direction. The transition metal is found to play a significant role in the flexoelectric response, with nitride-based MXenes consistently displaying larger coefficients than their carbide counterparts. Moreover, the coefficients increase with structural thickness, but when normalized by the bending modulus, which is also computed for all 126 monolayers, they exhibit the opposite trend.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and ferroelectric phase diagram of twisted CrI$_3$ layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moir\'e textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and thickness.Due to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Metal-Organic Precursors for Focused Ion Beam Induced Deposition through Solid-Layer Decomposition Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of modern metal deposition techniques like Focused Ion/Electron Beam Induced Deposition FIBID/FEBID relies heavily on the availability of metal-organic precursors of particular properties. To create a new precursor, extensive testing under specialized gas injection systems is required along with time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically conducted using scanning electron microscopes. This process can be quite challenging due to its complexity and expense. Here, the response of new metal-organic precursors, in the form of supported thick layers, to the ion beam irradiation is studied through analysis of the chemical composition and morphology of the resulting structures. This is done using SEM BSE/EDX along with Machine Learning data processing techniques. This approach enables a comprehensive fast examination of precursor decomposition processes during FIB irradiation, and provides valuable insights into how the precursor's composition influences the final properties of the metal-rich deposits. Although solid-layer irradiation differs from gas-phase deposition, we think that our method, can be employed to optimize pre-screen and score new potential precursors for FIB applications by significantly reducing the time required and conserving valuable resources.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nested quantum dot structure for improved control of entanglement induced by the Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit with relative motion. The entanglement is quantified by the mutual information (MI). The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces greater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining in the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a function of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of long-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to substantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction, indicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate significant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different moving directions lead to varying MI values. We also consider the scenario without the nested dot and find that the same maximum (among all times) MI is pre-determined solely by the initial angle between the spins. In this case, the entanglement exhibits different growth characteristics during different phases. The saturation of the MI mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional quantum dot, where exchange and time are combined into a single parameter, the amount of interaction.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Model for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>

Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately predict the band structure and topology of crystalline systems and they have been heavily used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is quite straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a basis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave equation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization methods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum chemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be achieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed by Solja\v{c}i\'c et. al., which regularize the $\Gamma$-point obstruction arising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.</description>
