      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>Localized Multi-Dimensional Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Stable vortex solitons sustained by a localized gain in the cubic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple dissipative system with purely cubic defocusing nonlinearity and nonuniform linear gain that can support stable local-ized dissipative vortex solitons with high topological charges without the utilization of competing nonlinearities and nonlinear gain or losses. Localization of such solitons is achieved due to an intriguing mechanism when defocusing nonlinearity stimulates energy flow from the ring-like region with linear gain to the periphery of the medium where energy is absorbed due to linear background losses. Vortex solitons bifurcate from linear gain-guided vortical modes with eigenvalues depending on topological charges that become purely real only at specific gain amplitudes. Increasing gain amplitude leads to transverse expansion of vortex solitons, but simultaneously it usually also leads to stability enhance-ment. Increasing background losses allows creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges that are usually prone to instabilities in conservative and dissipative systems. Propagation of the perturbed unstable vortex solitons in this system reveals unusual dynamical re-gimes, when instead of decay or breakup, the initial state transforms into stable vortex soliton with lower or sometimes even with higher topo-logical charge. Our results suggest an efficient mechanism for the formation of nonlinear excited vortex-carrying states with suppressed destructive azimuthal modulational instabilities in a simple setting relevant to a wide class of systems, including polaritonic systems, structured microcavities, and lasers.</description>

      <title>A new derivation of the amplitude of asymptotic oscillatory tails of weakly delocalized solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of the amplitude, $\alpha$, of asymptotic standing wave tails of weakly delocalized, stationary solutions in a fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation is revisited. Assuming the coefficient of the fifth order derivative term, $\epsilon^2\ll1$, a new derivation of the ``beyond all orders in $\epsilon$'' amplitude, $\alpha$, is presented. It is shown by asymptotic matching techniques, extended to higher orders in $\epsilon$, that the value of $\alpha$ can be obtained from the asymmetry at the center of the unique solution exponentially decaying in one direction. This observation, complemented by some fundamental results of Hammersley and Mazzarino [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 424, 19 (1989)], not only sheds new light on the computation of $\alpha$, but also greatly facilitates its numerical determination to a remarkable precision for so small values of $\epsilon$, which are beyond the capabilities of standard numerical methods.</description>
