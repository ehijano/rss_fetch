      <title>Inertial active matter with Coulomb friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction is central to the motion of active (self-propelled) objects, such as bacteria, animals or robots. While in a viscous fluid friction is typically described by Stokes' law, objects in contact with other solid bodies are often governed by more complex empirical friction laws. We study active dry particles subject to dry Coulomb friction force numerically and analytically. The interplay of friction and activity forces induces a rich behavior resulting in three distinct dynamical regimes. While for low activity levels, active Brownian motion is recovered, for large activity we observe a dynamical Stop &amp; Go regime continuously switching from diffusion and accelerated motion. For further activity values, we observe a super-mobile dynamical regime characterized by a fully accelerated motion which is described by an anomalous scaling of the diffusion coefficient with the activity. These findings cannot be observed with Stokes viscous forces typical of active swimmers but are central in dry active objects.</description>

      <title>Many-defect solutions in planar nematics: interactions, spiral textures and boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From incompressible flows to electrostatics, harmonic functions can provide solutions to many two-dimensional problems and, similarly, the director field of a planar nematic can be determined using complex analysis. We derive a closed-form solution for a quasi-steady state director field induced by an arbitrarily large set of point defects and circular inclusions with or without fixed rotational degrees of freedom, and compute the forces and torques acting on each defect or inclusion. We show that a complete solution must include two types of singularities, generating a defect winding number and its spiral texture, which have a direct effect on defect equilibrium textures and their dynamics. The solution accounts for discrete degeneracy of topologically distinct free energy minima which can be obtained by defect braiding. The derived formalism can be readily applied to equilibrium and slowly evolving nematic textures for active or passive fluids with multiple defects present within the orientational order.</description>

      <title>Best-in-class modeling: A novel strategy to discover constitutive models for soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to automatically discover interpretable mathematical models from data could forever change how we model soft matter systems. For convex discovery problems with a unique global minimum, model discovery is well-established. It uses a classical top-down approach that first calculates a dense parameter vector, and then sparsifies the vector by gradually removing terms. For non-convex discovery problems with multiple local minima, this strategy is infeasible since the initial parameter vector is generally non-unique. Here we propose a novel bottom-up approach that starts with a sparse single-term vector, and then densifies the vector by systematically adding terms. Along the way, we discover models of gradually increasing complexity, a strategy that we call best-in-class modeling. To identify successful candidate terms, we reverse-engineer a library of sixteen functional building blocks that integrate a century of knowledge in material modeling with recent trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Yet, instead of solving the discrete combinatorial problem with 65,536 possible combinations of terms, best-in-class modeling starts with the best one-term model and iteratively repeats adding terms, until the objective function meets a user-defined convergence criterion. Strikingly, we achieve good convergence with only one or two terms. We illustrate the best-in-class one- and two-term models for a variety of soft matter systems including rubber, brain, artificial meat, skin, and arteries. Our discovered models display distinct and unexpected features for each family of materials, and suggest that best-in-class modeling is an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use strategy to discover the mechanical signatures of traditional and unconventional soft materials. We anticipate that our technology will generalize naturally to other classes of natural and man-made soft matter.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Antimicrobial Activity of Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bactericidal potency of ionic liquids (ILs) is well-established, yet their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show evidence that the bactericidal action of ILs primarily involves permeabilizing the bacterial cell membrane. Our findings reveal that ILs exert their effects by directly interacting with the lipid bilayer and enhancing the membrane dynamics. Lateral lipid diffusion is accelerated which in turn augments membrane permeability, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Furthermore, our results establish a significant connection: an increase in the alkyl chain length of ILs correlates with a notable enhancement in both lipid lateral diffusion and antimicrobial potency. This underscores a compelling correlation between membrane dynamics and antimicrobial effectiveness, providing valuable insights for the rational design and optimization of IL-based antimicrobial agents in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Origins of Fine Structure in DNA Melting Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the help of one-dimensional random Potts-like model we study the origins of fine structure observed on differential melting profiles of double-stranded DNA. We assess the effects of sequence arrangement on DNA melting curves through the comparison of results for random, correlated, and block sequences. Our results re-confirm the smearing out the fine structure with the increase of chain length for all types of sequence arrangements and suggest fine structure to be a finite-size effect. We have found, that the fine structure in chains comprised of blocks with the correlation in sequence is more persistent, probably, because of increased sequence disorder the blocks introduce. Many natural DNAs show a well-expressed fine structure of melting profiles. In view of our results it might mean the existence of blocks in such DNAs. The very observation of fine structure may also mean, that there exists an optimal length for natural DNAs \emph{in vivo}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on the properties of curved linear brushes in good solvent. To this end, we extend the strong stretching theory for polydisperse brushes to curved geometries and investigate the polymer chain end profiles, bending moduli and other properties for experimentally relevant polymer chain length distributions of the Schulz-Zimm type. We also investigate the properties of End Exclusion Zones (EEZ) that may appear in convex geometries under certain conditions, and show that their position in the brush can be engineered by careful selection of the polymer length distribution. Lastly, we propose a method to engineer chain end profiles by engineering the polymer length distribution.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for cellular function, presenting a canonical example of rapid molecular sorting inside cells. It consists of a coordinated interplay between import/export of molecules in/out the cell nucleus. Here, we investigate the role of spatio-temporal dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation. We develop a biophysical model that captures the main features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular, its regulation through the Ran cycle. Our model yields steady-state profiles for the molecular components of the Ran cycle, their relaxation times, as well as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic molecule ratio. We show that these quantities are affected by their spatial dynamics and heterogeneity within the nucleus. Specifically, we find that the spatial nonuniformity of Ran Guanine Exchange Factor (RanGEF) -- particularly its proximity to the nuclear envelope -- enhances the Ran cycle's efficiency. We further show that RanGEF's accumulation near the nuclear envelope results from its intrinsic dynamics as a nuclear cargo, transported by the Ran cycle itself. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of molecular spatial dynamics in cellular processes, and proposes new avenues for theoretical and experimental inquiries into the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Emergence of large-scale mechanical spiral waves in bacterial living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propagating spiral waves have been discovered in various chemical, biological and physical systems. Spiral waves in multicellular organisms are often associated with essential living functions. Although certain eukaryotic microorganisms have long been known to generate spiral waves, evidence of spiral wave pattern has not been lacking in the bacterial world. Here we report the discovery of a unique form of propagating spiral waves in dense bacterial populations where cells engage in cyclic force-generating processes driven by type-IV pilus motility. Specifically, we discovered that synchronization of pilus activity in the bacterial living matter leads to large-scale spatiotemporal regulation of tension force in the form of propagating spiral waves. Theoretical modelling reveals that the spiral tension waves result from nonreciprocity in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of large-scale force regulation in bacterial world and may shed light on the emergent mechanics of biofilms and microbiomes. Pilus-driven bacterial living matter also provides a mechanical active medium for studying electrical or chemical spiral waves in living systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalizes quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalized Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterize the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on protein kinases and their inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

Abstract: Despite the simplicity of the water molecule, the kinetics of ice nucleation under natural conditions can be complex. We investigated spontaneously grown ice nuclei using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and found significant differences between the kinetics of ice formation through spontaneously formed and ideal nuclei. Since classical nucleation theory can only provide a good description of ice nucleation in ideal conditions, we propose a generalized nucleation theory that can better characterize the kinetics of ice crystal nucleation in general conditions. This study provides an explanation on why previous experimental and computational studies have yielded widely varying critical nucleation sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain-controlled criticality governs the elasticity of jamming and fiber networks. While the upper critical dimension of jamming is believed to be $d_u$=2, non mean-field exponents are observed in numerical studies of 2D and 3D fiber networks. The origins of this remains unclear. In this study we propose a minimal mean-field model for strain-controlled criticality of fiber networks. We then extend this to a phenomenological field theory, in which non mean-field behavior emerges as a result of the disorder in the network structure. We predict that the upper critical dimension for such systems is $d_u$=4 using a Gaussian approximation. Moreover, we identify an order parameter for the phase transition, which has been lacking for fiber networks to date.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and wrinkling patterns of pressurized bent tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Take a drinking straw and bend it from its ends. After sufficient bending, the tube buckles forming a kink, where the curvature is localized in a very small area. This instability, known generally as the Brazier effect, is inherent to thin-walled cylindrical shells, which are particularly ubiquitous in living systems, such as rod-shaped bacteria. However, tubular biological structures are often pressurized, and the knowledge of the mechanical response upon bending in this scenario is limited. In this work, we use a computational model to study the mechanical response and the deformations as a result of bending pressurized tubes. In addition, we employ tension-field theory to describe the mechanical behaviour before and after the wrinkling transition. Furthermore, we investigate the development and evolution of wrinkle patterns beyond the instability, showing different wrinkled configurations. We discover the existence of a multi-wavelength mode following the purely sinusoidal wrinkles and anticipating the kinked configuration of the tube.</description>
