      <title>Completely Multipolar Model for Many-Body Water-Ion and Ion-Ion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work constructs an advanced force field, the Completely Multipolar Model (CMM), to quantitatively reproduce each term of an energy decomposition analysis (EDA) for aqueous solvated alkali metal cations and halide anions and their ion pairings. We find that all individual EDA terms remain well-approximated in the CMM for ion-water and ion-ion interactions, except for polarization, which shows errors due to the partial covalency of ion interactions near their equilibrium. We quantify the onset of the dative bonding regime by examining the change in molecular polarizability and Mayer bond indices as a function of distance, showing that partial covalency manifests by breaking the symmetry of atomic polarizabilities while strongly damping them the at short-range. This motivates an environment-dependent atomic polarizability parameter that depends on the strength of the local electric field experienced by the ions to account for strong damping, with anisotropy introduced by atomic multipoles. The resulting CMM model for ions provides accurate dimer surfaces and three-body polarization and charge transfer compared to EDA, and shows excellent performance on various ion benchmarks including vibrational frequencies and cluster geometries.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Dailey-Townes model: chemical information from the electric field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reexamine the Dailey-Townes model by systematically investigating the electric field gradient (EFG) in various chlorine compounds, dihalogens, and the uranyl ion. Through the use of relativistic molecular calculations and projection analysis, we decompose the EFG expectaton value in terms of atomic reference orbitals. We show how the Dailey-Townes model can be seen as an approximation to our projection analysis. Moreover, we observe for the chlorine compounds that, in general, the Dailey-Townes model deviates from the total EFG value. We show that the main reason for this is that the Dailey-Townes model does not account for contributions from the mixing of valence p orbitals with subvalence ones. We also find a non-negligible contribution from core polarization. This can be interpreted as Sternheimer shielding, as discussed in an appendix. The predictions of the Dailey-Townes model are improved by replacing net populations by gross ones, but we have not found any theoretical justification for this. Subsequently, for the molecular systems XCl (where X = I, At, and Ts), we find that with the inclusion of spin-orbit interaction, the (electronic) EFG operator is no longer diagonal within an atomic shell, which is incompatible with the Dailey-Townes model. Finally, we examine the EFG at the uranium position in uranyl, where we find that about half the EFG comes from core polarization. The other half comes from the combination of the U-O bonds and the U(6p) orbitals, the latter mostly non-bonding, in particular with spin-orbit interaction included. The analysis was carried out with molecular orbitals localized according to the Pipek-Mezey criterion. Surprisingly, we observed that core orbitals are also rotated during this localization procedure, even though they are fully localized. We show in an appendix that, using this localization criterion, it is actually allowed.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of the Origins of UV Absorption in Alpha-3C Protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, there has been a growing body of experimental work showing that proteins devoid of aromatic and conjugated groups can absorb light in the near-UV beyond 300 nm and emit visible light. Understanding the origins of this phenomena offers the possibility of designing non-invasive spectroscopic probes for local interactions in biological systems. It was recently found that the synthetic protein {\alpha}3C displays UV-vis absorption between 250-800 nm which was shown to arise from charge-transfer excitations between charged amino acids. In this work, we use data-driven discovery to revisit the origins of these features using molecular dynamics and excited-state simulations. Specifically, an unsupervised learning approach beginning with encoding protein environments with local atomic descriptors, is employed to automatically detect relevant structural motifs. We identify three main motifs corresponding to different hydrogen-bonding patterns that are subsequently used to perform QM/MM simulations including the entire protein and solvent bath with the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) approach. Hydrogen-bonding structures involving arginine and carboxylate groups appear to be the most prone to near-UV absorption. We show that these features are highly sensitive to the size of the QM region employed as well as to the inclusion of explicit solvation underscoring the limitations of using gas-phase cluster models.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Generation of Diverse Low-Bandgap Molecules with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Can the electron density be interpreted information-theoretically? A critical analysis using quantum information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum chemical similarity measures have been derived and substantiated by applying concepts and quantities from information theory to the electron density. To justify the use of information theory, the electron density is usually equated to a probability distribution, despite the fact that such an assumption can give rise to inconsistencies such as negative Kullback-Leibler divergences. In this work we show, using quantum information theory, that both interpreting electron densities as probability distributions as well as any pragmatic normalization thereof gives rise to far-reaching information theoretical inconsistencies. By applying the theory of open quantum subsystems to quantum chemical partitions, we show using thought experiments that many statements concerning the information content of atoms in molecules need to be reconsidered. This study represents a step towards generalizing and reformulating the information theoretical approach to conceptual quantum chemistry beyond its classical perspective.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Unified framework for open quantum dynamics with memory"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent article by Ivander, Lindoy and Lee [Nature Communications 15, 8087 (2024)] claims to discover the relationship between the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the path integral for a system coupled to a harmonic bath. However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in the context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J. Chem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses in its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows the SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The absence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude GQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an auxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer tensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 110401 (2014)]. Further, the Dyck path section of this article follows precisely the diagrammatic analysis developed by Wang and Cai in a recent paper [Communications in Computational Physics 36, 389 (2024)]. We elaborate on these three critiques in this Comment.</description>

      <title>Regulating protocols of globally coupled continuum systems: Effects on dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling and understanding phenomena in coupled systems remains a significant challenge across diverse fields. This study investigates a simple globally coupled chemical system that exhibits a range of rich collective dynamics, from coherence to chimera states, controllable by a system parameter. We explore the effects of altering this control parameter using two different protocols. In protocol-I, a continuous variation of the control parameter leads to memory effects, resulting in two distinct sets of phenomena in the forward and reverse directions. In contrast, protocol-II, which includes a resetting feature, yields an entirely distinct collection of behaviors. Additionally, we capture the evolution of key elements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics associated with these dynamical states under both protocols, revealing distinct signatures for each. This work highlights the complexity and uniqueness of regulating coupled systems via control parameters compared to corresponding single systems, and it carries potential implications for the manipulation and application of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>The role of surface material properties on the behavior of ionic liquids in nanoconfinement: A critical review and perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature ionic liquids show great promise as electrolytes in various technological applications, such as energy storage or electrotunable lubrication. These applications are particularly intriguing due to the specific behavior of ionic liquids in nanoconfinement. While previous research has been focused on optimizing the required characteristics through the selection of electrolyte properties, the contribution of confining material properties in these systems has been largely overlooked. In this Review, we provide constructive analysis of recent developments related to the description of surface material properties impact on the ionic liquid behavior in the confinement and propose potential ways for further investigations in this direction. Although the presented advances reveal the importance of surface material properties in the application processes with confined ionic liquids, there are still a lot of issues that should be thoroughly investigated in future. We believe that this review will significantly contribute to the development of new approaches with material properties consideration for confined ionic liquid research.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Inhibitory Ion Transport in Functionalized Angstrom-Scale Two-Dimensional Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant success has been achieved in fabricating angstrom-scale artificial solid ionic channels aiming to replicate the biological ion channels (BICs).Besides high selectivity, BICs also exhibit sophisticated ion gating and interplay. However, such behavior and functionality are seldomly recreated in the artificial counterparts due to the insufficient understanding of the molecular origin. Here we report cooperative and inhibitory ion transport in angstrom-scale acetate functionalized MoS2 two dimensional channels.</description>

      <title>Coherent X-rays reveal anomalous molecular diffusion and cage effects in crowded protein solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein motion within the cell is crucial for predicting reaction rates and macromolecular transport in the cytoplasm. A key question is how crowded environments affect protein dynamics through hydrodynamic and direct interactions at molecular length scales. Using megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL), we investigate ferritin diffusion at microsecond time scales. Our results reveal anomalous diffusion, indicated by the non-exponential decay of the intensity autocorrelation function $g_2(q,t)$ at high concentrations. This behavior is consistent with the presence of cage-trapping in between the short- and long-time protein diffusion regimes. Modeling with the $\delta\gamma$-theory of hydrodynamically interacting colloidal spheres successfully reproduces the experimental data by including a scaling factor linked to the protein direct interactions. These findings offer new insights into the complex molecular motion in crowded protein solutions, with potential applications for optimizing ferritin-based drug delivery, where protein diffusion is the rate-limiting step.</description>

      <title>How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning framework for accelerating spin-lattice relaxation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and lattice vibrations are able to couple to the spin of electrons and lead to their relaxation and decoherence. Ab initio simulations have played a fundamental role in shaping our understanding of this process but further progress is hindered by their high computational cost. Here we present an accelerated computational framework based on machine-learning models for the prediction of molecular vibrations and spin-phonon coupling coefficients. We apply this method to three open-shell coordination compounds exhibiting long relaxation times and show that this approach achieves semi-to-full quantitative agreement with ab initio methods reducing the computational cost by about 80%. Moreover, we show that this framework naturally extends to molecular dynamics simulations, paving the way to the study of spin relaxation in condensed matter beyond simple equilibrium harmonic thermal baths.</description>
