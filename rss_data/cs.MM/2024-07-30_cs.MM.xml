      <title>Start from Video-Music Retrieval: An Inter-Intra Modal Loss for Cross Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning short video industry has accelerated the advancement of video-music retrieval technology, assisting content creators in selecting appropriate music for their videos. In self-supervised training for video-to-music retrieval, the video and music samples in the dataset are separated from the same video work, so they are all one-to-one matches. This does not match the real situation. In reality, a video can use different music as background music, and a music can be used as background music for different videos. Many videos and music that are not in a pair may be compatible, leading to false negative noise in the dataset. A novel inter-intra modal (II) loss is proposed as a solution. By reducing the variation of feature distribution within the two modalities before and after the encoder, II loss can reduce the model's overfitting to such noise without removing it in a costly and laborious way. The video-music retrieval framework, II-CLVM (Contrastive Learning for Video-Music Retrieval), incorporating the II Loss, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the YouTube8M dataset. The framework II-CLVTM shows better performance when retrieving music using multi-modal video information (such as text in videos). Experiments are designed to show that II loss can effectively alleviate the problem of false negative noise in retrieval tasks. Experiments also show that II loss improves various self-supervised and supervised uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks, and can obtain good retrieval models with a small amount of training samples.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Partial Optimal Transport Framework for Music-guided Movie Trailer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trailer generation is a challenging video clipping task that aims to select highlighting shots from long videos like movies and re-organize them in an attractive way. In this study, we propose an inverse partial optimal transport (IPOT) framework to achieve music-guided movie trailer generation. In particular, we formulate the trailer generation task as selecting and sorting key movie shots based on audio shots, which involves matching the latent representations across visual and acoustic modalities. We learn a multi-modal latent representation model in the proposed IPOT framework to achieve this aim. In this framework, a two-tower encoder derives the latent representations of movie and music shots, respectively, and an attention-assisted Sinkhorn matching network parameterizes the grounding distance between the shots' latent representations and the distribution of the movie shots. Taking the correspondence between the movie shots and its trailer music shots as the observed optimal transport plan defined on the grounding distances, we learn the model by solving an inverse partial optimal transport problem, leading to a bi-level optimization strategy. We collect real-world movies and their trailers to construct a dataset with abundant label information called CMTD and, accordingly, train and evaluate various automatic trailer generators. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our IPOT method consistently shows superiority in subjective visual effects and objective quantitative measurements.</description>

      <title>The Future is Meta: Metadata, Formats and Perspectives towards Interactive and Personalized AV Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of media content has undergone tremendous changes in recent years. Multiple daily content updates are just as common for some platforms as is processing the provided content specifically for their target audiences. Such features are made possible through metadata, which make information accessible by categorizing it. In conjunction with AI-supported tools, metadata are shaping the future of audio-visual content production, distribution and consumption. It allows editors to effectively search through archives like in the Tailored Media Project, broadcasters to provide content that is adapted to users' surroundings like in the ARD Audiothek unterwegs project, or give users the ability to experience audio-visual content from different perspectives like in the ORPHEUS project. Although these projects provide comprehensive insight into the potential of metadata, their integration in existing infrastructures meets several limitations. For example, content-related metadata may initially be generated at some point during the production process but will then be lost at later stages due to current standards and incomplete software implementations. In our contribution, we will discuss requirements and potential approaches and give an outlook on possible fields of application and use-cases.</description>

      <title>HeadsetOff: Enabling Photorealistic Video Conferencing on Economical VR Headsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have become increasingly popular for remote collaboration, but video conferencing poses challenges when the user's face is covered by the headset. Existing solutions have limitations in terms of accessibility. In this paper, we propose HeadsetOff, a novel system that achieves photorealistic video conferencing on economical VR headsets by leveraging voice-driven face reconstruction. HeadsetOff consists of three main components: a multimodal attention-based predictor, a generator, and an adaptive controller. The predictor effectively predicts user future behavior based on different modalities. The generator employs voice input, head motion, and eye blink to animate the human face. The adaptive controller dynamically selects the appropriate generator model based on the trade-off between video quality and delay, aiming to maximize Quality of Experience while minimizing latency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HeadsetOff in achieving high-quality, low-latency video conferencing on economical VR headsets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimedia and computer vision technologies requires adaptive visual model deployment strategies to effectively handle diverse tasks and varying environments. This work introduces AxiomVision, a novel framework that can guarantee accuracy by leveraging edge computing to dynamically select the most efficient visual models for video analytics under diverse scenarios. Utilizing a tiered edge-cloud architecture, AxiomVision enables the deployment of a broad spectrum of visual models, from lightweight to complex DNNs, that can be tailored to specific scenarios while considering camera source impacts. In addition, AxiomVision provides three core innovations: (1) a dynamic visual model selection mechanism utilizing continual online learning, (2) an efficient online method that efficiently takes into account the influence of the camera's perspective, and (3) a topology-driven grouping approach that accelerates the model selection process. With rigorous theoretical guarantees, these advancements provide a scalable and effective solution for visual tasks inherent to multimedia systems, such as object detection, classification, and counting. Empirically, AxiomVision achieves a 25.7\% improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach towards image authentication and tampering detection by using watermarking as a communication channel for semantic information. We modify the HiDDeN deep-learning watermarking architecture to embed and extract high-dimensional real vectors representing image captions. Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and benign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.</description>

      <title>MangaUB: A Manga Understanding Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manga is a popular medium that combines stylized drawings and text to convey stories. As manga panels differ from natural images, computational systems traditionally had to be designed specifically for manga. Recently, the adaptive nature of modern large multimodal models (LMMs) shows possibilities for more general approaches. To provide an analysis of the current capability of LMMs for manga understanding tasks and identifying areas for their improvement, we design and evaluate MangaUB, a novel manga understanding benchmark for LMMs. MangaUB is designed to assess the recognition and understanding of content shown in a single panel as well as conveyed across multiple panels, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of a model's various capabilities required for manga understanding. Our results show strong performance on the recognition of image content, while understanding the emotion and information conveyed across multiple panels is still challenging, highlighting future work towards LMMs for manga understanding.</description>

      <title>Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</description>

      <title>Magic3DSketch: Create Colorful 3D Models From Sketch-Based 3D Modeling Guided by Text and Language-Image Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The requirement for 3D content is growing as AR/VR application emerges. At the same time, 3D modelling is only available for skillful experts, because traditional methods like Computer-Aided Design (CAD) are often too labor-intensive and skill-demanding, making it challenging for novice users. Our proposed method, Magic3DSketch, employs a novel technique that encodes sketches to predict a 3D mesh, guided by text descriptions and leveraging external prior knowledge obtained through text and language-image pre-training. The integration of language-image pre-trained neural networks complements the sparse and ambiguous nature of single-view sketch inputs. Our method is also more useful and offers higher degree of controllability compared to existing text-to-3D approaches, according to our user study. Moreover, Magic3DSketch achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real dataset with the capability of producing more detailed structures and realistic shapes with the help of text input. Users are also more satisfied with models obtained by Magic3DSketch according to our user study. Additionally, we are also the first, to our knowledge, add color based on text description to the sketch-derived shapes. By combining sketches and text guidance with the help of language-image pretrained models, our Magic3DSketch can allow novice users to create custom 3D models with minimal effort and maximum creative freedom, with the potential to revolutionize future 3D modeling pipelines.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Signal based Human Silhouette Segmentation: A Sequential Diffusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) signals have been proved to be flexible for human silhouette segmentation (HSS) under complex environments. Existing studies are mainly based on a one-shot approach, which lacks a coherent projection ability from the RF domain. Additionally, the spatio-temporal patterns have not been fully explored for human motion dynamics in HSS. Therefore, we propose a two-stage Sequential Diffusion Model (SDM) to progressively synthesize high-quality segmentation jointly with the considerations on motion dynamics. Cross-view transformation blocks are devised to guide the diffusion model in a multi-scale manner for comprehensively characterizing human related patterns in an individual frame such as directional projection from signal planes. Moreover, spatio-temporal blocks are devised to fine-tune the frame-level model to incorporate spatio-temporal contexts and motion dynamics, enhancing the consistency of the segmentation maps. Comprehensive experiments on a public benchmark -- HIBER demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method with an IoU 0.732. Our code is available at https://github.com/ph-w2000/SDM.</description>

      <title>IBMEA: Exploring Variational Information Bottleneck for Multi-modal Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where the entities can be associated with related images. Most existing studies integrate multi-modal information heavily relying on the automatically-learned fusion module, rarely suppressing the redundant information for MMEA explicitly. To this end, we explore variational information bottleneck for multi-modal entity alignment (IBMEA), which emphasizes the alignment-relevant information and suppresses the alignment-irrelevant information in generating entity representations. Specifically, we devise multi-modal variational encoders to generate modal-specific entity representations as probability distributions. Then, we propose four modal-specific information bottleneck regularizers, limiting the misleading clues in refining modal-specific entity representations. Finally, we propose a modal-hybrid information contrastive regularizer to integrate all the refined modal-specific representations, enhancing the entity similarity between MMKGs to achieve MMEA. We conduct extensive experiments on two cross-KG and three bilingual MMEA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and also shows promising and robust performance in low-resource and high-noise data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models into a Tri-Modal Architecture for Automated Depression Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive mental health condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based tri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of depression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture incorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses a two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first work to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for this task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge cross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split, surpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In Leave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score of 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.</description>

      <title>AdaCoder: Adaptive Prompt Compression for Programmatic Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual question answering aims to provide responses to natural language questions given visual input. Recently, visual programmatic models (VPMs), which generate executable programs to answer questions through large language models (LLMs), have attracted research interest. However, they often require long input prompts to provide the LLM with sufficient API usage details to generate relevant code. To address this limitation, we propose AdaCoder, an adaptive prompt compression framework for VPMs. AdaCoder operates in two phases: a compression phase and an inference phase. In the compression phase, given a preprompt that describes all API definitions in the Python language with example snippets of code, a set of compressed preprompts is generated, each depending on a specific question type. In the inference phase, given an input question, AdaCoder predicts the question type and chooses the appropriate corresponding compressed preprompt to generate code to answer the question. Notably, AdaCoder employs a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts, negating the necessity of additional training and maintaining adaptability across different powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT and Claude. In experiments, we apply AdaCoder to ViperGPT and demonstrate that it reduces token length by 71.1%, while maintaining or even improving the performance of visual question answering.</description>

      <title>MVPbev: Multi-view Perspective Image Generation from BEV with Test-time Controllability and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to address the multi-view perspective RGB generation from text prompts given Bird-Eye-View(BEV) semantics. Unlike prior methods that neglect layout consistency, lack the ability to handle detailed text prompts, or are incapable of generalizing to unseen view points, MVPbev simultaneously generates cross-view consistent images of different perspective views with a two-stage design, allowing object-level control and novel view generation at test-time. Specifically, MVPbev firstly projects given BEV semantics to perspective view with camera parameters, empowering the model to generalize to unseen view points. Then we introduce a multi-view attention module where special initialization and de-noising processes are introduced to explicitly enforce local consistency among overlapping views w.r.t. cross-view homography. Last but not least, MVPbev further allows test-time instance-level controllability by refining a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our extensive experiments on NuScenes demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-resolution photorealistic images from text descriptions with thousands of training samples, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate the advances of our method in terms of generalizability and controllability with the help of novel evaluation metrics and comprehensive human analysis. Our code, data, and model can be found in \url{https://github.com/kkaiwwana/MVPbev}.</description>

      <title>Official-NV: A News Video Dataset for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently received more attention. However, the number of fake news detection data sets for video modal is small, and these data sets are composed of unofficial videos uploaded by users, so there is too much useless data. To solve this problem, we present in this paper a dataset named Official-NV, which consists of officially published news videos on Xinhua. We crawled videos on Xinhua, and then extended the data set using LLM generation and manual modification. In addition, we benchmarked the data set presented in this paper using a baseline model to demonstrate the advantage of Official-NV in multimodal fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Detached and Interactive Multimodal Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Learning (MML) has gained significant interest as it compensates for single-modality limitations through comprehensive complementary information within multimodal data. However, traditional MML methods generally use the joint learning framework with a uniform learning objective that can lead to the modality competition issue, where feedback predominantly comes from certain modalities, limiting the full potential of others. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces DI-MML, a novel detached MML framework designed to learn complementary information across modalities under the premise of avoiding modality competition. Specifically, DI-MML addresses competition by separately training each modality encoder with isolated learning objectives. It further encourages cross-modal interaction via a shared classifier that defines a common feature space and employing a dimension-decoupled unidirectional contrastive (DUC) loss to facilitate modality-level knowledge transfer. Additionally, to account for varying reliability in sample pairs, we devise a certainty-aware logit weighting strategy to effectively leverage complementary information at the instance level during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on audio-visual, flow-image, and front-rear view datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method.

      <title>LoginMEA: Local-to-Global Interaction Network for Multi-modal Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between two multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), whose entities can be associated with relational triples and related images. Most previous studies treat the graph structure as a special modality, and fuse different modality information with separate uni-modal encoders, neglecting valuable relational associations in modalities. Other studies refine each uni-modal information with graph structures, but may introduce unnecessary relations in specific modalities. To this end, we propose a novel local-to-global interaction network for MMEA, termed as LoginMEA. Particularly, we first fuse local multi-modal interactions to generate holistic entity semantics and then refine them with global relational interactions of entity neighbors. In this design, the uni-modal information is fused adaptively, and can be refined with relations accordingly. To enrich local interactions of multi-modal entity information, we device modality weights and low-rank interactive fusion, allowing diverse impacts and element-level interactions among modalities. To capture global interactions of graph structures, we adopt relation reflection graph attention networks, which fully capture relational associations between entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior results of our method over 5 cross-KG or bilingual benchmark datasets, indicating the effectiveness of capturing local and global interactions.</description>

      <title>ComNeck: Bridging Compressed Image Latents and Multimodal LLMs via Universal Transform-Neck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first-ever study of adapting compressed image latents to suit the needs of downstream vision tasks that adopt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs have extended the success of large language models to modalities (e.g. images) beyond text, but their billion scale hinders deployment on resource-constrained end devices. While cloud-hosted MLLMs could be available, transmitting raw, uncompressed images captured by end devices to the cloud requires an efficient image compression system. To address this, we focus on emerging neural image compression and propose a novel framework with a lightweight transform-neck and a surrogate loss to adapt compressed image latents for MLLM-based vision tasks. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to multiple application scenarios, where the neural image codec can be (1) pre-trained for human perception without updating, (2) fully updated for joint human and machine perception, or (3) fully updated for only machine perception. The transform-neck trained with the surrogate loss is universal, for it can serve various downstream vision tasks enabled by a variety of MLLMs that share the same visual encoder. Our framework has the striking feature of excluding the downstream MLLMs from training the transform-neck, and potentially the neural image codec as well. This stands out from most existing coding for machine approaches that involve downstream networks in training and thus could be impractical when the networks are MLLMs. Extensive experiments on different neural image codecs and various MLLM-based vision tasks show that our method achieves great rate-accuracy performance with much less complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MambaGesture: Enhancing Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Mamba and Disentangled Multi-Modality Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19976</link>

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for producing synchronized and realistic human gestures that accompany speech, enhancing the animation of lifelike avatars in virtual environments. While diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities, current approaches often overlook a wide range of modalities and their interactions, resulting in less dynamic and contextually varied gestures. To address these challenges, we present MambaGesture, a novel framework integrating a Mamba-based attention block, MambaAttn, with a multi-modality feature fusion module, SEAD. The MambaAttn block combines the sequential data processing strengths of the Mamba model with the contextual richness of attention mechanisms, enhancing the temporal coherence of generated gestures. SEAD adeptly fuses audio, text, style, and emotion modalities, employing disentanglement to deepen the fusion process and yield gestures with greater realism and diversity. Our approach, rigorously evaluated on the multi-modal BEAT dataset, demonstrates significant improvements in Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), diversity scores, and beat alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance in co-speech gesture generation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained AudioLDM for Sound Generation: A Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03857</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved breakthroughs in sound generation. Despite the outstanding sample quality, current sound generation models face issues on small-scale datasets (e.g., overfitting), significantly limiting performance. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate the benefits of pre-training on sound generation with AudioLDM, the cutting-edge model for audio generation, as the backbone. Our study demonstrates the advantages of the pre-trained AudioLDM, especially in data-scarcity scenarios. In addition, the baselines and evaluation protocol for sound generation systems are not consistent enough to compare different studies directly. Aiming to facilitate further study on sound generation tasks, we benchmark the sound generation task on various frequently-used datasets. We hope our results on transfer learning and benchmarks can provide references for further research on conditional sound generation.</description>

      <title>Overcome Modal Bias in Multi-modal Federated Learning via Balanced Modality Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting proper clients to participate in each federated learning (FL) round is critical to effectively harness a broad range of distributed data. Existing client selection methods simply consider the mining of distributed uni-modal data, yet, their effectiveness may diminish in multi-modal FL (MFL) as the modality imbalance problem not only impedes the collaborative local training but also leads to a severe global modality-level bias. We empirically reveal that local training with a certain single modality may contribute more to the global model than training with all local modalities. To effectively exploit the distributed multiple modalities, we propose a novel Balanced Modality Selection framework for MFL (BMSFed) to overcome the modal bias. On the one hand, we introduce a modal enhancement loss during local training to alleviate local imbalance based on the aggregated global prototypes. On the other hand, we propose the modality selection aiming to select subsets of local modalities with great diversity and achieving global modal balance simultaneously. Our extensive experiments on audio-visual, colored-gray, and front-back datasets showcase the superiority of BMSFed over baselines and its effectiveness in multi-modal data exploitation.</description>
