      <title>Comparison of stochastic BGK and FP methods for the simulation of non-equilibrium multi-species molecular gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18599v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to limited possibilities of experimental investigations for non-equilibrium gas flows, numerical results are of highest interest. Although the well-established Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method achieves highly accurate solutions, the computational requirements increase excessively for lower Knudsen regimes. Computationally more efficient simulations can be achieved with stochastic continuum-based methods using either the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) or the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximations where, instead of particle collisions, particle relaxation processes are considered. This paper explains the implementation of different stochastic BGK and FP methods in the open-source particle code PICLas for multi-species molecular gas flows. For verification, the results of different test cases are compared.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of a Uniformly Heated Hard Sphere Granular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a molecular dynamics simulation of an inelastic gas, where collisions between molecules are characterized by a coefficient of restitution less than unity. The simulation employs an event-driven algorithm to efficiently propagate the system in time, tracking molecular positions and velocities. A thermostat mechanism is incorporated to maintain the system's temperature by applying Gaussian white noise to the molecular velocities. The system's kinetic energy evolves towards a non-equilibrium steady state, with the initial dynamics governed by the interplay between energy input from the thermostat and energy dissipation through inelastic collisions. This steady state emerges when the energy gain from the thermostat balances the energy loss due to inelastic collisions. We calculate the coefficients of the Sonine polynomial expansion of the velocity distribution function to show that the velocity distribution exhibits a departure from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the steady state.</description>

      <title>Aging Dynamics and Velocity Field Correlations in Three-Dimensional Uniformly Heated Granular Gases: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a molecular dynamics simulation of an inelastic gas system utilizing an event-driven algorithm combined with a thermostat mechanism. Initially, the kinetic energy of the system experiences a decay before settling into a non-equilibrium steady state. To explore the aging characteristics, we analyze the velocity autocorrelation function, denoted as \( C(t_w, t) \). Our findings indicate that \( C(t_w, t) \) exhibits a dependence on both waiting time \( t_w \) and correlation time \( t \) in an independent manner. At the outset, \( C(t_w, t) \) demonstrates an exponential decay pattern. With increasing \( t_w \), a slower decay is observed, which can be attributed to the development of correlations in the velocity field. The explicit relationship of \( C(t_w, t) \) with respect to \( t_w \) serves as compelling evidence of the aging properties present in the system. These results deepen our comprehension of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the dynamics of dissipative systems. Our research has significant implications for a range of applications involving inelastic collisions, extending from granular materials to phenomena observed in astrophysics. The simulation methodology and the insights gained contribute to the wider field of complex systems, shedding light on the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium, particularly those characterized by energy dissipation due to inelastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Three Laws of Statistical Linguistics Emerging in images</title>

Abstract: Images, as a product evolving alongside civilization, develop similarly to natural languages with the advancement of civilization. Not only are images abundant in daily life, but are also influenced by technology in shaping their forms, embodying various characteristics as they evolve in time. Language is a sequence of symbols that represents thoughts. While a written language is typically associated with the close integration of text and sound, as a combination of visual symbols and perception, the communicative power of image is no less significant. This is especially notable since 60% of the sensory input received by our central nervous system comes from vision. Given the symbolic system inherent in images, we are curious whether images can also exhibit the laws of statistical linguistics. To explore this, we begin with the relationship between human thought and visual perception to decode how images are formed by the latter mechanism. Building upon previous studies that established the high correlation between pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and the human visual system, we use the VGG-19 to define words via each kernel and calculate the number of pixels with grayscale values greater than 90%. By (a) ranking words frequency, (b) randomizing the order of kernel appearances and performing the same word count accumulation, and (c) summing the word counts layer by layer, we are surprised to find that Zipf's, Heaps', and Benford's laws of statistical linguistics also exist in the words that comprises the text representing different images.</description>

      <title>From non-equilibrium Green functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Combining physics-based and data-driven models: advancing the frontiers of research with Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a recently emerged research field which combines physics-based and data-driven models for the numerical approximation of differential problems. Physics-based models rely on the physical understanding of the problem at hand, subsequent mathematical formulation, and numerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations between input and output data without arguing any causality principle underlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven models have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been triggered by a huge availability of data (the so-called big data), an increasingly cheap computing power, and the development of powerful machine learning algorithms. SciML leverages the physical awareness of physics-based models and, at the same time, the efficiency of data-driven algorithms. With SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into machine learning algorithms. Yet, we can rely on data-driven algorithms' capability to discover complex and non-linear patterns from data and improve the descriptive capacity of physics-based models. After recalling the mathematical foundations of digital modelling and machine learning algorithms, and presenting the most popular machine learning architectures, we discuss the great potential of a broad variety of SciML strategies in solving complex problems governed by partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the successful application of SciML to the simulation of the human cardiac function, a field of significant socio-economic importance that poses numerous challenges on both the mathematical and computational fronts. The corresponding mathematical model is a complex system of non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations describing the electromechanics, valve dynamics, blood circulation, perfusion in the coronary tree, and torso potential. Despite the robustness and accuracy of physics-based models, certain aspects, such as unveiling constitutive laws for cardiac cells and myocardial material properties, as well as devising efficient reduced order models to dominate the extraordinary computational complexity, have been successfully tackled by leveraging data-driven models.</description>

      <title>coupledMatrixFoam: a foam-extend-based fully-implicit solver for heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of multiphase flows in porous media is fundamental to various fields, including oil recovery, CO2 sequestration, hydrogeology, and others. Accurate predictions of fluid behavior in these systems can enhance process efficiency while mitigating environmental and health risks. In this context, numerical simulation serves as a powerful tool for anticipating complex flow phenomena and optimizing engineering strategies. Both commercial simulators and open-source softwares, such as the porousMultiphaseFoam repository based on the OpenFOAM framework, have been developed to model these processes. However, simulating heterogeneous porous media with complex porosity and permeability distributions poses significant numerical challenges. To address these, we introduce coupledMatrixFoam, a new OpenFOAM-based solver designed for enhanced robustness and numerical stability. coupledMatrixFoam integrates the Eulerian multi-fluid formulation for phase fractions with Darcy's law for porous media flow, employing a fully implicit, block-coupled solution for the governing equations. Built on Foam-extend 5.0, it leverages the latest fvBlockMatrix developments to improve computational efficiency. This approach enables a significant increase in time step sizes, particularly in cases involving capillary pressure effects and other complex physical interactions. This work details the development, implementation, and validation of coupledMatrixFoam, including comparisons with porousMultiphaseFoam to assess performance improvements. Additionally, a scalability analysis is conducted, demonstrating the solver's suitability for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which are essential for large-scale, real-world simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is arguably the most efficient sampling method for general probability distributions of continuous variables. Together with exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) the HMC becomes equivalent to direct sampling for quadratic actions $S(x)=\frac12 x^\mathsf{T} M x$ (i.e. normal distributions $x\sim \mathrm{e}^{-S(x)}$), only perturbatively worse for perturbative deviations of the action from the quadratic case, and it remains viable for arbitrary actions. In this work the most recent improvements of the HMC including EFA and radial updates are collected into a numerical recipe.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. By propagating local information to distance particles, Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) extend the locality concept to model interactions beyond their local neighborhood. Still, this locality precludes modeling long-range effects, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects, which are critical to adequately describe many real-world systems. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenging modeling of non-local interactions and the high computational cost of MPNNs. This novel architecture generalizes the fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network (4GHDNN) concept, integrating the charge equilibration (Qeq) method into a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. A series of benchmarks show that CELLI can extend the strictly local Allegro architecture to model highly non-local interactions and charge transfer. Our architecture generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures, achieving an accuracy comparable to MPNNs at about twice the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>VeloxQ: A Fast and Efficient QUBO Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VeloxQ, a fast and efficient solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are central to numerous real-world optimization tasks. Unlike other physics-inspired approaches to optimization problems, such as quantum annealing and quantum computing, VeloxQ does not require substantial progress of technology to unlock its full potential. We benchmark VeloxQ against the state-of-the-art QUBO solvers based on emerging technologies. Our comparison includes quantum annealers, specifically D-Wave's Advantage, and Advantage2 prototype platforms, the digital-quantum algorithm designed to solve Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) developed by Kipu Quantum, physics-inspired algorithms: Simulated Bifurcation and Parallel Annealing and an algorithm based on tropical tensor networks. We also take into account modern developments of conventional algorithms: Branch and Bound algorithm, an optimal implementation of the brute-force algorithm and BEIT QUBO solver. Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors. These findings position VeloxQ as a powerful and practical tool for tackling large-scale QUBO and HUBO problems, offering a compelling alternative to existing quantum and classical optimization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent the ground state of quantum many-body systems, including fermionic systems. However, efficiently integrating lattice symmetries into neural representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in fermionic wavefunctions and demonstrate its ability to target both ground states and low-lying excitations. Using group-equivariant neural backflow transformations, we study the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling. Our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves ground-state energies and yields accurate low-energy excitations for lattices up to 10 x 10. We also compute accurate two-point density-correlation functions and the structure factor to identify phase transitions and critical points. These findings introduce a symmetry-aware framework important for studying quantum materials and phase transitions.</description>
