      <title>Surface guided analysis of breast changes during post-operative radiotherapy by using a functional map framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of breast cancer using radiotherapy involves uncertainties regarding breast positioning. As the studies progress, more is known about the expected breast positioning errors, which are taken into account in the Planning Target Volume (PTV) in the form of the margin around the clinical target volume. However, little is known about the non-rigid deformations of the breast in the course of radiotherapy, which is a non-negligible factor to the treatment.
Purpose: Taking into account such inter-fractional breast deformations would help develop a promising future direction, such as patient-specific adjustable irradiation plannings.
Methods: In this study, we develop a geometric approach to analyze inter-fractional breast deformation throughout the radiotherapy treatment. Our data consists of 3D surface scans of patients acquired during radiotherapy sessions using a handheld scanner. We adapt functional map framework to compute inter-and intra-patient non-rigid correspondences, which are then used to analyze intra-patient changes and inter-patient variability.
Results: The qualitative shape collection analysis highlight deformations in the contralateral breast and armpit areas, along with positioning shifts on the head or abdominal regions. We also perform extrinsic analysis, where we align surface acquisitions of the treated breast with the CT-derived skin surface to assess displacements and volume changes in the treated area. On average, displacements within the treated breast exhibit amplitudes of 1-2 mm across sessions, with higher values observed at the time of the 25 th irradiation session. Volume changes, inferred from surface variations, reached up to 10%, with values ranging between 2% and 5% over the course of treatment.
Conclusions: We propose a comprehensive workflow for analyzing and modeling breast deformations during radiotherapy using surface acquisitions, incorporating a novel inter-collection shape matching approach to model shape variability within a i shared space across multiple patient shape collections. We validate our method using 3D surface data acquired from patients during External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) sessions, demonstrating its effectiveness.
The clinical trial data used in this paper is registered under the ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03801850.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Directional Extremal Boundary of a Union of Equal-Radius Circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the directional extremal boundary of a union of equal-radius circles. We introduce an efficient algorithm that accurately determines this boundary by analyzing the intersections and dominant relationships among the circles. The algorithm has time complexity of O(n log n).</description>

      <title>Structure and Independence in Hyperbolic Uniform Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider intersection graphs of disks of radius $r$ in the hyperbolic plane. Unlike the Euclidean setting, these graph classes are different for different values of $r$, where very small $r$ corresponds to an almost-Euclidean setting and $r \in \Omega(\log n)$ corresponds to a firmly hyperbolic setting. We observe that larger values of $r$ create simpler graph classes, at least in terms of separators and the computational complexity of the \textsc{Independent Set} problem.
  First, we show that intersection graphs of disks of radius $r$ in the hyperbolic plane can be separated with $\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\log n)$ cliques in a balanced manner. Our second structural insight concerns Delaunay complexes in the hyperbolic plane and may be of independent interest. We show that for any set $S$ of $n$ points with pairwise distance at least $2r$ in the hyperbolic plane the corresponding Delaunay complex has outerplanarity $1+\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log n}{r})$, which implies a similar bound on the balanced separators and treewidth of such Delaunay complexes.
  Using this outerplanarity (and treewidth) bound we prove that \textsc{Independent Set} can be solved in $n^{\mathcal{O}(1+\frac{\log n}{r})}$ time. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming on some unknown sphere cut decomposition that is based on the solution. The resulting algorithm is a far-reaching generalization of a result of Kisfaludi-Bak (SODA 2020), and it is tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In particular, \textsc{Independent Set} is polynomial-time solvable in the firmly hyperbolic setting of $r\in \Omega(\log n)$. Finally, in the case when the disks have ply (depth) at most $\ell$, we give a PTAS for \textsc{Maximum Independent Set} that has only quasi-polynomial dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ and $\ell$. Our PTAS is a further generalization of our exact algorithm.</description>

      <title>Computing the Polytope Diameter is Even Harder than NP-hard (Already for Perfect Matchings)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of a polytope is a fundamental geometric parameter that plays a crucial role in understanding the efficiency of the simplex method. Despite its central nature, the computational complexity of computing the diameter of a given polytope is poorly understood. Already in 1994, Frieze and Teng [Comp. Compl.] recognized the possibility that this task could potentially be harder than NP-hard, and asked whether the corresponding decision problem is complete for the second stage of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. $\Pi^p_2$-complete. In the following years, partial results could be obtained. In a cornerstone result, Frieze and Teng themselves proved weak NP-hardness for a family of custom defined polytopes. Sanit\`a [FOCS18] in a break-through result proved that already for the much simpler fractional matching polytope the problem is strongly NP-hard. Very recently, Steiner and N\"obel [SODA25] generalized this result to the even simpler bipartite perfect matching polytope and the circuit diameter. In this paper, we finally show that computing the diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope is $\Pi^p_2$-hard. Since the corresponding decision problem is also trivially contained in $\Pi^p_2$, this decidedly answers Frieze and Teng's 30 year old question. Our results also hold when the diameter is replaced by the circuit diameter. As our second main result, we prove that for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the (circuit) diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope cannot be approximated by a factor better than $(1 + \varepsilon)$. This answers a recent question by N\"obel and Steiner. It is the first known inapproximability result for the circuit diameter, and extends Sanit\`a's inapproximability result of the diameter to the totally unimodular case.</description>
