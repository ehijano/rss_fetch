      <title>Finding the Center and Centroid of a Graph with Multiple Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a "fair" meeting place when S people want to get together. Specifically, we will consider the cases where a "fair" meeting place is defined to be either 1) a node on a graph that minimizes the maximum time/distance to each person or 2) a node on a graph that minimizes the sum of times/distances to each of the sources. In graph theory, these nodes are denoted as the center and centroid of a graph respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for finding the center and centroid of a graph by using a multiple source alternating Dijkstra's Algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a stopping condition that significantly saves on time complexity without compromising the accuracy of the solution. The results of this paper are a low complexity algorithm that is optimal in computing the center of S sources among N nodes and a low complexity algorithm that is close to optimal for computing the centroid of S sources among N nodes.</description>

      <title>Monotone Arc Diagrams with few Biarcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every planar graph has a monotone topological 2-page book embedding where at most (4n-10)/5 (of potentially 3n-6) edges cross the spine, and every edge crosses the spine at most once; such an edge is called a biarc. We can also guarantee that all edges that cross the spine cross it in the same direction (e.g., from bottom to top). For planar 3-trees we can further improve the bound to (3n-9)/4, and for so-called Kleetopes we obtain a bound of at most (n-8)/3 edges that cross the spine. The bound for Kleetopes is tight, even if the drawing is not required to be monotone. A Kleetope is a plane triangulation that is derived from another plane triangulation T by inserting a new vertex v_f into each face f of T and then connecting v_f to the three vertices of f.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity Landscape of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Two-Sets Cut-Uncut, we are given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and two terminal sets $S$ and $T$. The task is to find a minimum cut $C$ in $G$ (if there is any) separating $S$ from $T$ under the following ``uncut'' condition. In the graph $(V,E \setminus C)$, the terminals in each terminal set remain in the same connected component. In spite of the superficial similarity to the classic problem Minimum $s$-$t$-Cut, Two-Sets Cut-Uncut is computationally challenging. In particular, even deciding whether such a cut of any size exists, is already NP-complete. We initiate a systematic study of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut within the context of parameterized complexity. By leveraging known relations between many well-studied graph parameters, we characterize the structural properties of input graphs that allow for polynomial kernels, fixed-parameter tractability (FPT), and slicewise polynomial algorithms (XP). Our main contribution is the near-complete establishment of the complexity of these algorithmic properties within the described hierarchy of graph parameters. On a technical level, our main results are fixed-parameter tractability for the (vertex-deletion) distance to cographs and an OR-cross composition excluding polynomial kernels for the vertex cover number of the input graph (under the standard complexity assumption NP is not contained in coNP/poly).</description>

      <title>Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>On Symmetries of Finite Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>

      <title>On the pseudorandomness of Parry--Bertrand automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation measure is a testimony of the pseudorandomness of a sequence $\infw{s}$ and provides information about the independence of some parts of $\infw{s}$ and their shifts. Combined with the well-distribution measure, a sequence possesses good pseudorandomness properties if both measures are relatively small. In combinatorics on words, the famous $b$-automatic sequences are quite far from being pseudorandom, as they have small factor complexity on the one hand and large well-distribution and correlation measures on the other. This paper investigates the pseudorandomness of a specific family of morphic sequences, including classical $b$-automatic sequences. In particular, we show that such sequences have large even-order correlation measures; hence, they are not pseudorandom. We also show that even- and odd-order correlation measures behave differently when considering some simple morphic sequences.</description>

      <title>ORBITAAL: A Temporal Graph Dataset of Bitcoin Entity-Entity Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on Bitcoin (BTC) transactions is a matter of interest for both economic and network science fields. Although this cryptocurrency is based on a decentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw blockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol specificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset, we present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph formalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to January 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity transaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is given in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This dataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and associated public addresses.</description>

      <title>The steady-states of splitter networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce splitter networks, which abstract the behavior of conveyor belts found in the video game Factorio. Based on this definition, we show how to compute the steady-state of a splitter network. Then, leveraging insights from the players community, we provide multiple designs of splitter networks capable of load-balancing among several conveyor belts, and prove that any load-balancing network on $n$ belts must have $\Omega(n \log n)$ nodes. Incidentally, we establish connections between splitter networks and various concepts including flow algorithms, flows with equality constraints, Markov chains and the Knuth-Yao theorem about sampling over rational distributions using a fair coin.</description>

      <title>From Tutte to Floater and Gotsman: On the Resolution of Planar Straight-line Drawings and Morphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09483v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algorithm of Tutte for constructing convex planar straight-line drawings and the algorithm of Floater and Gotsman for constructing planar straight-line morphs are among the most popular graph drawing algorithms. In this paper, focusing on maximal plane graphs, we prove tight bounds on the resolution of the planar straight-line drawings produced by Floater's algorithm, which is a broad generalization of Tutte's algorithm. Further, we use such a result in order to prove a lower bound on the resolution of the drawings of maximal plane graphs produced by Floater and Gotsman's morphing algorithm. Finally, we show that such a morphing algorithm might produce drawings with exponentially-small resolution, even when transforming drawings with polynomial resolution.</description>

      <title>Testing Isomorphism of Graphs in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the graph $[G]$ obtained by adding, for each pair of vertices of $G$, a unique vertex adjacent to both vertices is called the binding graph of $G$. In this work, we show that the class of binding graphs is graph-isomorphism complete and that the stable partitions of binding graphs by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm produce automorphism partitions. To test the isomorphism of two graphs $G$ and $H$, one computes the stable graph of the binding graph $[G\uplus H]$ for the disjoint union graph $G\uplus H$. The automorphism partition reveals the isomorphism of $G$ and $H$. Because the WL algorithm is a polynomial-time procedure, the claim can be made that the graph-isomorphism problem is in complexity class $\mathtt{P}$.</description>

      <title>Graph-SCP: Accelerating Set Cover Problems with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used to accelerate combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a much smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning aimed at minimizing the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</description>

      <title>Density of group languages in shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some "pattern" in the shift space, for example a pattern like "words with an even number of a given letter." We study the density of group languages, i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups, inside shift spaces. We show that the density with respect to any given ergodic measure on a shift space exists for every group language, because it can be computed by using any ergodic lift of the given measure to some skew product between the shift space and the recognizing group. We then further study densities in shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and then in minimal shifts. In the latter case, we obtain a closed formula for the density under the condition that the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is just the cardinality of the subset of the group which defines the language divided by the cardinality of the group. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.</description>
