      <title>Absolutely monotonic functions related to the asymptotic formula for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}\left( x\right) $ be the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and \begin{equation*} \mathcal{G}_{p}\left( x\right) =e^{\mathcal{K}\left( \sqrt{x} \right) }-\frac{p}{\sqrt{1-x}} \end{equation*} for $p\in \mathbb{R}$ and $x\in \left( 0,1\right) $. In this paper we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the functions $\pm \mathcal{G} _{p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( x\right) $ ($k\in \mathbb{N\cup }\left\{ 0\right\} $) to be absolutely monotonic on $\left( 0,1\right) $, which extend previous known results and yield several new functional inequalities involving the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. More importantly, we provide a new method to deal with those absolute monotonicity problem by proving the monotonicity of a sequence generated by the coefficients of the power series of $\mathcal{G}_{p}\left( x\right) $.</description>

      <title>Muckenhoupt Weights Meet Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung Formulae in Ball Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, via first establishing a weighted variant of the profound and far-reaching inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore in 2003, the authors give two new characterizations of Muckenhoupt weights. As an application, the authors further establish a representation formula of gradients with sharp parameters in ball Banach function spaces, which extends the famous formula obtained by H. Brezis, A. Seeger, J. Van Schaftingen, and P.-L. Yung in 2021 from classical Sobolev spaces to various different Sobolev-type spaces and gives an affirmative answer to the question in page 29 of [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023), Paper No. 234]. The most novelty of this article exists in subtly revealing the mutual equivalences among the Muckenhoupt weight, the weighted variant of the inequality of Cohen et al., and the weighted upper estimate of the formula of Brezis et al.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <title>Summing divergent matrix series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend several celebrated methods in classical analysis for summing series of complex numbers to series of complex matrices. These include the summation methods of Abel, Borel, Ces\'aro, Euler, Lambert, N\"orlund, and Mittag-Leffler, which are frequently used to sum scalar series that are divergent in the conventional sense. One feature of our matrix extensions is that they are fully noncommutative generalizations of their scalar counterparts -- not only is the scalar series replaced by a matrix series, positive weights are replaced by positive definite matrix weights, order on $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by Loewner order, exponential function replaced by matrix exponential function, etc. We will establish the regularity of our matrix summation methods, i.e., when applied to a matrix series convergent in the conventional sense, we obtain the same value for the sum. Our second goal is to provide numerical algorithms that work in conjunction with these summation methods. We discuss how the block and mixed-block summation algorithms, the Kahan compensated summation algorithm, may be applied to matrix sums with similar roundoff error bounds. These summation methods and algorithms apply not only to power or Taylor series of matrices but to any general matrix series including matrix Fourier and Dirichlet series. We will demonstrate the utility of these summation methods: establishing a Fej\'{e}r's theorem and alleviating the Gibbs phenomenon for matrix Fourier series; extending the domains of matrix functions and accurately evaluating them; enhancing the matrix Pad\'e approximation and Schur--Parlett algorithms; and more.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between non-commutative harmonic oscillators and two-photon quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative harmonic oscillator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ introduced by Parmeggiani and Wakayama is equivalent to the two-photon quantum Rabi model, and they are also equivalent to a holomorphic differential equation on the unit disk. The confluence process of this differential equation and the relation with the one-photon quantum Rabi model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Functional inequalities in the framework of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quadrilateral inequality established by C. Sch\"otz in the context of Hilbert spaces is extended to the framework of Banach spaces. Our approach is based on the theory of majorization and a substitute for the parallelogram law associated with Clarkson's notion of von Neumann-Jordan constant. Several examples (concerning matrix theory and geometry of Banach spaces) that illustrate our new results are also included.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of symmetric Kubo-Ando operator means satisfying Moln\'ar's weak associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means that was first introduced and studied in L. Moln\'ar, ``Characterizations of certain means of positive operators," Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166. In Theorem 6 of that paper, he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the Moln\'ar class of means) in terms of the operator monotone functions representing the means, which includes the geometric mean. Furthermore, he leaves open the problem to determine if the geometric mean is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give an alternative characterization of the Moln\'ar class of means in terms of the boundary-values of bounded harmonic functions on certain rectangles which completely characterizes this class of means. Moreover, we use this to construct an explicit example of a mean in the subclass that is not the geometric means thereby solving the open problem of L. Moln\'ar.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for a uniform asymptotic approximation of the zeros of the Bessel function $J_{\nu}(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent asymptotic expansion for the positive zeros $x=j_{\nu,m}$ ($m=1,2,3,\ldots$) of the Bessel function of the first kind $J_{\nu}(x)$ is studied, where the order $\nu$ is positive. Unlike previous well-known expansions in the literature, this is uniformly valid for one or both $m$ and $\nu$ unbounded, namely $m=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $1 \leq \nu &lt; \infty$. Explicit and simple lower and upper error bounds are derived for the difference between $j_{\nu,m}$ and the first three terms of the expansion. The bounds are sharp in the sense they are close to the value of the fourth term of the expansion (i.e. the first neglected term).</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for the Bergman projection on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate weighted Lebesgue space estimates for the Bergman projection on a simply connected planar domain via the domain's Riemann map. We extend the bounds which follow from a standard change-of-variable argument in two ways. First, we provide a regularity condition on the Riemann map, which turns out to be necessary in the case of uniform domains, in order to obtain the full range of weighted estimates for the Bergman projection for weights in a B\'{e}koll\`{e}-Bonami-type class. Second, by slightly strengthening our condition on the Riemann map, we obtain the weighted weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate as well. Our proofs draw on techniques from both conformal mapping and dyadic harmonic analysis.</description>
