      <title>Optimal Transport Divergences induced by Scoring Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ scoring functions, used in statistics for eliciting risk functionals, as cost functions in the Monge-Kantorovich (MK) optimal transport problem. This gives raise to a rich variety of novel asymmetric MK divergences, which subsume the family of Bregman-Wasserstein divergences. We show that for distributions on the real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the majority of the new divergences. Specifically, we derive the optimal coupling of the MK divergences induced by functionals including the mean, generalised quantiles, expectiles, and shortfall measures. Furthermore, we show that while any elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measure gives raise to infinitely many MK divergences, the comonotonic coupling is simultaneously optimal.
  The novel MK divergences, which can be efficiently calculated, open an array of applications in robust stochastic optimisation. We derive sharp bounds on distortion risk measures under a Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraint, and solve for cost-efficient payoffs under benchmark constraints.</description>

      <title>Consistent asset modelling with random coefficients and switches between regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a stochastic model that enables capturing external influences in two specific ways. The model allows for the expression of uncertainty in the parametrisation of the stochastic dynamics and incorporates patterns to account for different behaviours across various times or regimes. To establish our framework, we initially construct a model with random parameters, where the switching between regimes can be dictated either by random variables or deterministically. Such a model is highly interpretable. We further ensure mathematical consistency by demonstrating that the framework can be elegantly expressed through local volatility models taking the form of standard jump diffusions. Additionally, we consider a Markov-modulated approach for the switching between regimes characterised by random parameters. For all considered models, we derive characteristic functions, providing a versatile tool with wide-ranging applications. In a numerical experiment, we apply the framework to the financial problem of option pricing. The impact of parameter uncertainty is analysed in a two-regime model, where the asset process switches between periods of high and low volatility imbued with high and low uncertainty, respectively.</description>
