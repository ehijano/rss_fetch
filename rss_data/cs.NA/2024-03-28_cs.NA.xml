      <title>A better compression driver? CutFEM 3D shape optimization taking viscothermal losses into account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compression driver, the standard sound source for midrange acoustic horns, contains a cylindrical compression chamber connected to the horn throat through a system of channels known as a phase plug. The main challenge in the design of the phase plug is to avoid resonance and interference phenomena. The complexity of these phenomena makes it difficult to carry out this design task manually, particularly when the phase-plug channels are radially oriented. Therefore, we employ an algorithmic technique that combines numerical solutions of the governing equations with a gradient-based optimization algorithm that can deform the walls of the phase plug. A particular modeling challenge here is that viscothermal losses cannot be ignored, due to narrow chambers and slits in the device. Fortunately, a recently developed, accurate, but computationally inexpensive boundary-layer model is applicable. We use this model, a level-set geometry description, and the Cut Finite Element technique to avoid mesh changes when the geometry is modified by the optimization algorithm. Moreover, the shape calculus needed to compute derivatives for the optimization algorithm is carried out in the fully discrete case. Applying these techniques, the algorithm was able to successfully design the shape of a set of radially-directed phase plugs so that the final frequency response surprisingly closely matches the ideal response, derived by a lumped circuit model where wave interference effects are not accounted for. This result may serve to resuscitate the radial phase plug design, rarely used in today's commercial compression drivers.</description>

Abstract: Unisolvence of unsymmetric Kansa collocation is still a substantially open problem. We prove that Kansa matrices with MultiQuadrics and Inverse MultiQuadrics for the Dirichlet problem of the Poisson equation are almost surely nonsingular, when the collocation points are chosen by any continuous random distribution in the domain interior and arbitrarily on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Shear banding and cracking in unsaturated porous media through a nonlocal THM meshfree paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermo-hydro-mechanical of unsaturated soils plays a significant role in dynamic shear banding and fracturing. In this article, we propose a thermo-hydro-mechanical material model in the periporomechanics paradigm to model shear banding and crack triggered by temperature. Periporomechanics is a nonlocal framework for the mechanics of unsaturated soil where a length scale dictates the nonlocal interaction between material points. Periporomechanics unites continuous and discontinuous deformation and fluid flow in porous media. As a new contribution, we incorporate the thermo-hydro-mechanical material model in the periporomechanics through the correspondence principle for modeling shear banding and cracking in unsaturated porous media. The stabilized PPM correspondence principle that mitigates the multiphase zero-energy mode instability is augmented. At the global level, we have numerically implemented the periporomechanics paradigm through an explicit Lagrangian meshfree algorithm in the global level. At the local level, we impose the return mapping algorithm to implement the thermo-hydro-mechanical constitutive model. We present numerical examples to demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of proposed periporomechanics for modeling the shear banding bifurcation and crack in unsaturated porous media triggered by temperature.</description>

      <title>Discretize first, filter next: learning divergence-consistent closure models for large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based large eddy simulation framework for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on the paradigm "discretize first, filter and close next". This leads to full model-data consistency and allows for employing neural closure models in the same environment as where they have been trained. Since the LES discretization error is included in the learning process, the closure models can learn to account for the discretization.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new divergence-consistent discrete filter defined through face-averaging. The new filter preserves the discrete divergence-free constraint by construction, unlike general discrete filters such as volume-averaging filters. We show that using a divergence-consistent LES formulation coupled with a convolutional neural closure model produces stable and accurate results for both a-priori and a-posteriori training, while a general (divergence-inconsistent) LES model requires a-posteriori training or other stability-enforcing measures.</description>

      <title>Higher order multi-dimension reduction methods via Einstein-product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the extension of dimension reduction (DR) techniques to the multi-dimension case by using the Einstein product. Our focus lies on graph-based methods, encompassing both linear and nonlinear approaches, within both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Additionally, we investigate variants such as repulsion graphs and kernel methods for linear approaches. Furthermore, we present two generalizations for each method, based on single or multiple weights. We demonstrate the straightforward nature of these generalizations and provide theoretical insights. Numerical experiments are conducted, and results are compared with original methods, highlighting the efficiency of our proposed methods, particularly in handling high-dimensional data such as color images.</description>

      <title>Mixed Variational Formulation of Coupled Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a mixed variational formulation for the problem of two coupled plates with a rigid {junction}. The proposed mixed {formulation} introduces {the union of} stresses and moments as {an auxiliary variable}, which {are} commonly of great interest in practical applications. The primary challenge lies in determining a suitable {space involving} both boundary and junction conditions of the auxiliary variable. The {theory} of densely defined operators in Hilbert spaces is employed to define {a nonstandard Sobolev space} without the use of trace operators. The well-posedness is established for the mixed formulation. Based on these conditions, this paper provides a framework {of} conforming {mixed} finite element methods. Numerical experiments are given to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of the penalty formulation for nonlinear magnetostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetostatic field distribution in a nonlinear medium amounts to the unique minimizer of the magnetic coenergy over all fields that can be generated by the same current. This is a nonlinear saddlepoint problem whose numerical solution can in principle be achieved by mixed finite element methods and appropriate nonlinear solvers. The saddlepoint structure, however, makes the solution cumbersome. A remedy is to split the magnetic field into a known source field and the gradient of a scalar potential which is governed by a convex minimization problem. The penalty approach avoids the use of artificial potentials and Lagrange multipliers and leads to an unconstrained convex minimization problem involving a large parameter. We provide a rigorous justification of the penalty approach by deriving error estimates for the approximation due to penalization. We further highlight the close connections to the Lagrange-multiplier and scalar potential approach. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests for a typical benchmark problem</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian approximation for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution is highly oscillatory when the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ is small. This method approximates the solution to the Schr\"odinger equation by an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis and provides a highly efficient computational method for high-frequency wave function evolution. In particular, we revise the standard FGA formula to address the singularities arising in the higher-order derivatives of coefficients of the associated Hamiltonian flow that are second-order continuously differentiable or smooth in conventional FGA analysis. We then establish its convergence to the true solution. Additionally, we provide some numerical examples to verify the accuracy and convergence behavior of the frozen Gaussian approximation method.</description>

      <title>Fractional variational integrators based on convolution quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional dissipation is a powerful tool to study non-local physical phenomena such as damping models. The design of geometric, in particular, variational integrators for the numerical simulation of such systems relies on a variational formulation of the model. In [19], a new approach is proposed to deal with dissipative systems including fractionally damped systems in a variational way for both, the continuous and discrete setting. It is based on the doubling of variables and their fractional derivatives. The aim of this work is to derive higher-order fractional variational integrators by means of convolution quadrature (CQ) based on backward difference formulas. We then provide numerical methods that are of order 2 improving a previous result in [19]. The convergence properties of the fractional variational integrators and saturation effects due to the approximation of the fractional derivatives by CQ are studied numerically.</description>

      <title>Computational decomposition and composition technique for approximate solution of nonstationary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable computational algorithms for the approximate solution of the Cauchy problem for nonstationary problems are based on implicit time approximations. Computational costs for boundary value problems for systems of coupled multidimensional equations can be reduced by additive decomposition of the problem operator(s) and composition of the approximate solution using particular explicit-implicit time approximations. Such a technique is currently applied in conditions where the decomposition step is uncomplicated. A general approach is proposed to construct decomposition-composition algorithms for evolution equations in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It is based on two main variants of the decomposition of the unit operator in the corresponding spaces at the decomposition stage and the application of additive operator-difference schemes at the composition stage. The general results are illustrated on the boundary value problem for a second-order parabolic equation by constructing standard splitting schemes on spatial variables and region-additive schemes (domain decomposition schemes).</description>

      <title>Global convergence of iterative solvers for problems of nonlinear magnetostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the convergence of iterative solvers for problems of nonlinear magnetostatics. Using the equivalence to an underlying minimization problem, we can establish global linear convergence of a large class of methods, including the damped Newton-method, fixed-point iteration, and the Kacanov iteration, which can all be interpreted as generalized gradient descent methods. Armijo backtracking isconsidered for an adaptive choice of the stepsize. The general assumptions required for our analysis cover inhomogeneous, nonlinear, and anisotropic materials, as well as permanent magnets. The main results are proven on the continuous level, but they carry over almost verbatim to various approximation schemes, including finite elements and isogeometric analysis, leading to bounds on the iteration numbers, which are independent of the particular discretization. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests for a typical benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Wirtinger gradient descent methods for low-dose Poisson phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of phase retrieval has many applications in the field of optical imaging. Motivated by imaging experiments with biological specimens, we primarily consider the setting of low-dose illumination where Poisson noise plays the dominant role. In this paper, we discuss gradient descent algorithms based on different loss functions adapted to data affected by Poisson noise, in particular in the low-dose regime. Starting from the maximum log-likelihood function for the Poisson distribution, we investigate different regularizations and approximations of the problem to design an algorithm that meets the requirements that are faced in applications. In the course of this, we focus on low-count measurements. For all suggested loss functions, we study the convergence of the respective gradient descent algorithms to stationary points and find constant step sizes that guarantee descent of the loss in each iteration. Numerical experiments in the low-dose regime are performed to corroborate the theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized convergence of the deep BSDE method: a step towards fully-coupled FBSDEs and applications in stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with high-dimensional coupled FBSDE systems approximated by the deep BSDE method of Han et al. (2018). It was shown by Han and Long (2020) that the errors induced by the deep BSDE method admit a posteriori estimate depending on the loss function, whenever the backward equation only couples into the forward diffusion through the Y process. We generalize this result to fully-coupled drift coefficients, and give sufficient conditions for convergence under standard assumptions. The resulting conditions are directly verifiable for any equation. Consequently, unlike in earlier theory, our convergence analysis enables the treatment of FBSDEs stemming from stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, we provide a theoretical justification for the non-convergence of the deep BSDE method observed in recent literature, and present direct guidelines for when convergence can be guaranteed in practice. Our theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Improving Efficiency of Parallel Across the Method Spectral Deferred Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel-across-the method time integration can provide small scale parallelism when solving initial value problems. Spectral deferred corrections (SDC) with a diagonal sweeper, which is closely related to iterated Runge-Kutta methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer, can use a number of threads equal to the number of quadrature nodes in the underlying collocation method. However, convergence speed, efficiency and stability depends critically on the used coefficients. Previous approaches have used numerical optimization to find good parameters. Instead, we propose an ansatz that allows to find optimal parameters analytically. We show that the resulting parallel SDC methods provide stability domains and convergence order very similar to those of well established serial SDC variants. Using a model for computational cost that assumes 80% efficiency of an implementation of parallel SDC we show that our variants are competitive with serial SDC, previously published parallel SDC coefficients as well as Picard iteration, explicit RKM-4 and an implicit fourth-order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates under a range invariance condition with application to electrical impedance tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to proving convergence rates of variational and iterative regularization methods under variational source conditions VSCs for inverse problems whose linearization satisfies a range invariance condition. In order to achieve this, often an appropriate relaxation of the problem needs to be found that is usually based on an augmentation of the set of unknowns and leads to a particularly structured reformulation of the inverse problem. We analyze three approaches that make use of this structure, namely a variational and a Newton type scheme, whose convergence without rates has already been established in \cite{rangeinvar}; additionally we propose a split minimization approach that can be show to satisfy the same rates results. \\ The range invariance condition has been verified for several coefficient identification problems for partial differential equations from boundary observations as relevant in a variety of tomographic imaging modalities. Our motivation particularly comes from the by now classical inverse problem of electrical impedance tomography EIT and we study both the original formulation by a diffusion type equation and its reformulation as a Schr\"odinger equation. For both of them we find relaxations that can be proven to satisfy the range invariance condition. Combining results on VSCs from \cite{Diss-Weidling} with the abstract framework for the three approaches mentioned above, we arrive at convergence rates results for the variational, split minimization and Newton type method in EIT.</description>

      <title>An exactly curl-free finite-volume scheme for a hyperbolic compressible barotropic two-phase model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new second order accurate structure-preserving finite volume scheme for the solution of the compressible barotropic two-phase model of Romenski et. al in multiple space dimensions. The governing equations fall into the wider class of symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) systems and consist of a set of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE). In the absence of algebraic source terms, the model is subject to a curl-free constraint for the relative velocity between the two phases. The main objective of this paper is, therefore, to preserve this structural property exactly also at the discrete level. The new numerical method is based on a staggered grid arrangement where the relative velocity field is stored in the cell vertexes while all the remaining variables are stored in the cell centers. This allows the definition of discretely compatible gradient and curl operators, which ensure that the discrete curl errors of the relative velocity field remain zero up to machine precision. A set of numerical results confirms this property also experimentally.</description>

      <title>Robust Numerical Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of numerical algebraic geometry consists of algorithms for numerically solving systems of polynomial equations. When the system is exact, such as having rational coefficients, the solution set is well-defined. However, for a member of a parameterized family of polynomial systems where the parameter values may be measured with imprecision or arise from prior numerical computations, uncertainty may arise in the structure of the solution set, including the number of isolated solutions, the existence of higher dimensional solution components, and the number of irreducible components along with their multiplicities. The loci where these structures change form a stratification of exceptional algebraic sets in the space of parameters. We describe methodologies for making the interpretation of numerical results more robust by searching for nearby parameter values on an exceptional set. We demonstrate these techniques on several illustrative examples and then treat several more substantial problems arising from the kinematics of mechanisms and robots.</description>

      <title>Deep polytopic autoencoders for low-dimensional linear parameter-varying approximations and nonlinear feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-dimensional parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the particular architecture enables higher order series expansions at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough numerical study.</description>

      <title>An inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method for linear programming problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inexact interior-point methods (IPMs) are a type of interior-point methods that inexactly solve the linear equation system for obtaining the search direction. On the other hand,arc-search IPMs approximate the central path with an ellipsoidal arc obtained by solving two linear equation systems in each iteration, while conventional line-search IPMs solve one linear system, therefore, the improvement due to the inexact solutions of the linear equation systems can be more beneficial in arc-search IPMs than conventional IPMs. In this paper, we propose an inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method.We establish that the proposed method is a polynomial-time algorithm through its convergence analysis. The numerical experiments with the conjugate gradient method show that the proposed method can reduce the number of iterations compared to an existing method for benchmark problems; the numbers of iterations are reduced to two-thirds for more than 70% of the problems.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent physics-informed deep learning material model for short fiber/polymer nanocomposites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL)-based constitutive model for investigating the viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of short fiber-reinforced nanoparticle-filled epoxies under various ambient conditions. The deep-learning model is trained to enforce thermodynamic principles, leading to a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model. To accomplish this, a long short-term memory network is combined with a feed-forward neural network to predict internal variables required for characterizing the internal dissipation of the nanocomposite materials. In addition, another feed-forward neural network is used to indicate the free-energy function, which enables defining the thermodynamic state of the entire system. The PIDL model is initially developed for the three-dimensional case by generating synthetic data from a classical constitutive model. The model is then trained by extracting the data directly from cyclic loading-unloading experimental tests. Numerical examples show that the PIDL model can accurately predict the mechanical behavior of epoxy-based nanocomposites for different volume fractions of fibers and nanoparticles under various hygrothermal conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Regularized Nonnegative Scale-invariant Low-rank Approximation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization or sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition are an important branch of dimensionality reduction models with enhanced interpretability. However, from a practical perspective, the choice of regularizers and regularization coefficients, as well as the design of efficient algorithms, is challenging because of the multifactor nature of these models and the lack of theory to back these choices. This paper aims at improving upon these issues. By studying a more general model called the Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant, we prove that the scale-invariance inherent to low-rank approximation models causes an implicit regularization with both unexpected beneficial and detrimental effects. This observation allows to better understand the effect of regularization functions in low-rank approximation models, to guide the choice of the regularization hyperparameters, and to design balancing strategies to enhance the convergence speed of dedicated optimization algorithms. Some of these results were already known but restricted to specific instances of regularized low-rank approximations. We also derive a generic Majorization Minimization algorithm that handles many regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations, with convergence guarantees. We showcase our contributions on sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, ridge-regularized Canonical Polyadic decomposition and sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning provides methods to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are a notable architecture in this field. Recently, an extension of DeepONet based on model reduction and neural networks, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-DeepONet, has been able to outperform other architectures in terms of accuracy for several benchmark tests. We extend this idea towards nonlinear model order reduction by proposing an efficient framework that combines neural networks with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for operator learning. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of KPCA-DeepONet over POD-DeepONet.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$-error bounds for approximations of the Koopman operator by kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by defining data-based observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Parabolic PDE-constrained optimal control under uncertainty with entropic risk measure using quasi-Monte Carlo integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the application of a tailored quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of optimal control problems subject to parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) constraints under uncertainty: the state in our setting is the solution of a parabolic PDE with a random thermal diffusion coefficient, steered by a control function. To account for the presence of uncertainty in the optimal control problem, the objective function is composed with a risk measure. We focus on two risk measures, both involving high-dimensional integrals over the stochastic variables: the expected value and the (nonlinear) entropic risk measure. The high-dimensional integrals are computed numerically using specially designed QMC methods and, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, the error rate is shown to be essentially linear, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem -- and thereby superior to ordinary Monte Carlo methods. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives three formulas for the pseudoinverse of a matrix product $A = CR$. The first is sometimes correct, the second is always correct, and the third is almost never correct. But that third randomized pseudoinverse $A^+_r$ may be very useful when $A$ is a very large matrix.
  1. $A^+ = R^+C^+$ when $A = CR$ and $C$ has independent columns and $R$ has independent rows.
  2. $A^+ = (C^+CR)^+(CRR^+)^+$ is always correct.
  3. $A^+_r = (P^TCR)^+P^TCRQ(CRQ)^+ = A^+$ only when $\mathrm{rank}(P^TA) = \mathrm{rank}(AQ) = \mathrm{rank}(A)$ with $A = CR$.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation method for the complete electrode model in electrical impedance tomography with tests on experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a boundary integral equation-based numerical method to solve for the electrostatic potential in two dimensions, inside a medium with piecewise constant conductivity, where the boundary condition is given by the complete electrode model (CEM). The CEM is seen as the most accurate model of the physical setting where electrodes are placed on the surface of an electrically conductive body, and currents are injected through the electrodes and the resulting voltages are measured again on these same electrodes. The integral equation formulation is based on expressing the electrostatic potential as the solution to a finite number of Laplace equations which are coupled through boundary matching conditions. This allows us to re-express the solution in terms of single layer potentials; the problem is thus re-cast as a system of integral equations on a finite number of smooth curves. We discuss an adaptive method for the solution of the resulting system of mildly singular integral equations. This solver is both fast and accurate. We then present a numerical inverse solver for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which uses our forward solver at its core. To demonstrate the applicability of our results we test our numerical methods on an open electrical impedance tomography data set provided by the Finnish Inverse Problems Society.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of high-order upwind summation-by-parts methods for nonlinear conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) operators developed by Mattsson (2017, doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2017.01.042) and study different flux vector splittings in this context. To do so, we introduce discontinuous-Galerkin-like interface terms for multi-block upwind SBP methods applied to nonlinear conservation laws. We investigate the behavior of the upwind SBP methods for flux vector splittings of varying complexity on Cartesian as well as unstructured curvilinear multi-block meshes. Moreover, we analyze the local linear/energy stability of these methods following Gassner, Sv\"ard, and Hindenlang (2022, doi:10.1007/s10915-021-01720-8). Finally, we investigate the robustness of upwind SBP methods for challenging examples of shock-free flows of the compressible Euler equations such as a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$-discrepancy for finite $p&gt;1$ suffers from the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L_p$-discrepancy is a classical quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution of an $N$-element point set in the $d$-dimensional unit cube. Its inverse for dimension $d$ and error threshold $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the number of points in $[0,1)^d$ that is required such that the minimal normalized $L_p$-discrepancy is less or equal $\varepsilon$. It is well known, that the inverse of $L_2$-discrepancy grows exponentially fast with the dimension $d$, i.e., we have the curse of dimensionality, whereas the inverse of $L_{\infty}$-discrepancy depends exactly linearly on $d$. The behavior of inverse of $L_p$-discrepancy for general $p \not\in \{2,\infty\}$ was an open problem since many years. Recently, the curse of dimensionality for the $L_p$-discrepancy was shown for an infinite sequence of values $p$ in $(1,2]$, but the general result seemed to be out of reach. In the present paper we show that the $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p$ in $(1,\infty)$ and only the case $p=1$ is still open. This result follows from a more general result that we show for the worst-case error of positive quadrature formulas for an anchored Sobolev space of once differentiable functions in each variable whose first mixed derivative has finite $L_q$-norm, where $q$ is the H\"older conjugate of $p$.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally positivity-preserving approximations of the Ait-Sahalia type model: Explicit Milstein-type schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article aims to design and analyze efficient first-order strong schemes for a generalized A\"{i}t-Sahalia type model arising in mathematical finance and evolving in a positive domain $(0, \infty)$, which possesses a diffusion term with superlinear growth and a highly nonlinear drift that blows up at the origin. Such a complicated structure of the model unavoidably causes essential difficulties in the construction and convergence analysis of time discretizations. By incorporating implicitness in the term $\alpha_{-1} x^{-1}$ and a corrective mapping $\Phi_h$ in the recursion, we develop a novel class of explicit and unconditionally positivity-preserving (i.e., for any step-size $h&gt;0$) Milstein-type schemes for the underlying model. In both non-critical and general critical cases, we introduce a novel approach to analyze mean-square error bounds of the novel schemes, without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations. The expected order-one mean-square convergence is attained for the proposed scheme. The above theoretical guarantee can be used to justify the optimal complexity of the Multilevel Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments are finally provided to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A monotone scheme for G-equations with application to the explicit convergence rate of robust central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.07184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a monotone approximation scheme for a class of fully nonlinear PDEs called G-equations. Such equations arise often in the characterization of G-distributed random variables in a sublinear expectation space. The proposed scheme is constructed recursively based on a piecewise constant approximation of the viscosity solution to the G-equation. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate with an explicit error bound, using the comparison principles for both the scheme and the equation together with a mollification procedure. The first application is obtaining the convergence rate of Peng's robust central limit theorem with an explicit bound of Berry-Esseen type. The second application is an approximation scheme with its convergence rate for the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation.</description>
