      <title>Deriving effective electrode-ion interactions from free-energy profiles at electrochemical interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Geometric direct minimization for low-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that configuration state functions (CSF) with local orbitals can provide a compact reference state for low-spin open-shell electronic structures, such as antiferromagnetic states. However, optimizing a low-spin configuration using self-consistent field (SCF) theory has been a long-standing challenge, since each orbital must be an eigenfunction of a different Fock operator. Here, I introduce a low-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) algorithm to optimize any CSF at mean-field cost. This algorithm employs quasi-Newton Riemannian optimization on the orbital constraint manifold to provide robust convergence, extending the Geometric Direct Minimization approach to open-shell electronic structures with arbitrary genealogical spin coupling. Numerical calculations on transition metal aquo complexes show improved convergence over existing methodology, and reveal the potential for many local CSF energy minima in iron-sulfur complexes. Finally, open-shell CSFs with different spin coupling patterns are used to qualitatively study the singlet ground state in polyacenes, revealing the onset of polyradical character for increasing chain length.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Fragment State Spaces within the Excitonic Renormalization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed excitonic renormalization framework presents an alternative ansatz to elec- tronic structure theory of weakly interacting fragments. It makes use of absolutely localized orbitals and correlated states evaluated on isolated fragments, which are then used to recover the interaction in an ab-initio manner based on a biorthogonal framework. The correlated monomer information can be heavily truncated, and the Hamiltonian can be expanded in a rapidly converging series, allow- ing the Hamiltonian to be built and diagonalized in a scalable fashion. However, the methodology still lacks an efficient bottom-up procedure, capable of producing optimized model state spaces for the isolated fragments, without ever building the Hamiltonian in the full monomer state spaces. In order to address this issue, this work presents an algorithm utilizing monomer gradients at three different levels as well as an efficient pre-screening of the determinant space, ensuring compact model state spaces and intermediates. Numerical results are presented for the beryllium dimer, showing that the algorithm is indeed capable of building compact model state spaces, yielding results that closely resemble those of the optimal model state spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that model state spaces, optimized at the zeroth order of the Hamiltonian expansion, can also be used to accurately recover first order results, enabling very efficient optimization, as the optimization can be conducted at a lower order than the targeted final level. Hence, the presented solver completes the excitonic renormalization methodology, forming a polynomially scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Region Decoupling through Structured Absorbing Potentials: A Framework for Scalable Time-Dependent Quantum Dynamics Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanical treatment of molecular reactions remains a longstanding challenge, especially for reactions involving deep potential wells and long-lived intermediate complexes. Here, we introduce an interaction region decoupling (IRD) strategy that incorporates structured absorbing potentials to dynamically partition the interaction region into reactant and product subspaces. The IRD framework integrates naturally with standard TDWP propagation schemes and enables the construction of region-specific basis sets, dramatically enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark applications to the F + HD and O + OH reactions demonstrate that this approach achieves state-resolved accuracy while reducing computational cost by over two orders of magnitude. This strategy paves the way for routine quantum mechanical treatment of complex-forming four-atom reactions previously considered intractable.</description>

      <title>Unveiling ZIF-8 nucleation mechanisms through molecular simulation: role of temperature, solvent and reactant concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenging task, as the size, morphology, polymorph and type and number of defects present on the synthesis product may depend on many variables, including temperature, solvent, concentration and nature of reactants, among others. A deeper understanding on how synthesis conditions determine the obtained material is crucial to optimize the use of resources when synthesizing new MOFs. In this contribution, we study the impact of changing concentration, solvent and temperature on the molecular level mechanisms of the solvothermal nucleation process of ZIF-8 relying on molecular dynamics simulations using a force field that incorporates metal-ligand reactivity. We find that the nucleation is faster when the synthesis is performed in dimethylsulfoxide than when it is performed in methanol, in alignment with experimental observations. In the early steps of the nucleation process, we observe the formation of linear oligomers containing metal ions and ligands, which start forming cycles later on. All simulations lead to the formation of a final state that is highly-connected and partially amorphous, which could be correlated to an intermediate species observed in direct experiments. The mechanism of formation of this phase mainly consists of the merging of smaller nuclei. Even though increasing temperature and the reactants concentration lead to a similar nucleation speedup, there are differences in ring populations and lifetimes within the highly-connected amorphous intermediate phases that are formed in each case. Finally, important differences in the free energy of Zn-2-methylimidazolate versus Zn-imidazolate subsequent binding events are revealed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Graph-based block-diagonalization of full configuration interaction Hamiltonian: H$_2$ chains study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a graph-based block-diagonalization (GBBD) method for the full configuration interaction Hamiltonian of molecular systems to efficiently calculate the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states. In this approach, the non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are represented as edges on a graph, which naturally decomposes into disconnected clusters. Each cluster corresponds to an independent block in the block-diagonalized form of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues in the low-energy sector were obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for each block matrix and by solving a modified Hamiltonian subject to orthonormality constraints with respect to previously computed lower-energy eigenstates. We applied the GBBD method to linear hydrogen H chains ranging from H$_2$ to H$_{12}$. The results showed excellent agreement with exact ones, confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, we discussed several physical properties with respect to the number of H$_2$ molecules.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chemically Accurate Adsorption Energy Using an Interpretable Deep Learning Model Pretrained by GGA Calculation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data, and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states (LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO puzzle" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>Cohesion mediated layering in sheared grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider pattern formation in a sheared dense mixture of cohesive and non-cohesive grains. Our findings show that cohesive grains, which would typically form distributed agglomerates, instead segregate into percolating stripes or layers when the cohesive grain concentration ($c_o$) and cohesion strength ($C$) increase -- in a way that the average agglomerate size and the average normal stress collapse onto a single curve when plotted against $c_oC$. Our central proposal is that the development of interfaces between cohesive and non-cohesive grains is akin to phase separation in binary molecular mixtures driven by an effective free energy, although we are dealing with a non-equilibrium system; we setup the segregation flux such that the effect of this free energy is activated only upon application of the external driving. By constructing the segregation flux proportional to the gradient of the variational derivative of the free energy, we closely reproduce the layering in the steady-state limit. We find a robust correspondence between the parameter $c_o C$ in the discrete simulations and the parameters in the free energy.</description>

      <title>Real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>
