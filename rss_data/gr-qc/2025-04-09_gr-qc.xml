      <title>Statistical Analysis of Cosmologies in f (R) Theories with DESI DR2 2025 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent results published by the DESI DR2 Collaboration and its compelling results in obtaining statistical preference for dynamical dark energy models over the standard {\Lambda}CDM model, this study presents an MCMC fit for all currently viable f (R) models using this dataset, along with a corresponding Bayesian analysis. The findings reveal very strong evidence in favor of f (R) models compared to {\Lambda}CDM model. The analysis also includes data from cosmic chronometers and the latest Pantheon Plus + SH0ES supernova compilation.</description>

      <title>Interacting dilatonic ghost condensate as dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the cosmological evolution of a dilatonic ghost condensate field responsible for dark energy, which interacts with dark matter through a source term. We explore three different interaction models to describe the present universe. For each interaction model, we perform a detailed phase-space analysis, obtaining the stability conditions, and identifying the critical points. Furthermore, we compare our interaction models with the most recent Hubble parameter and supernova Ia data as functions of redshift. Additionally, we investigate the conditions for scaling regimes in these models and analyze the successful transition toward an attractor point to characterize the behavior of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The lifetime of white hole remnants is $M^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black-to-white hole scenario is a well-motivated proposal from non-perturbative quantum gravity concerning the final stage of black hole evaporation. In this framework, a black hole of initial mass $M$ undergoes Hawking evaporation over a timescale of order $M^3$ before tunneling into a long-lived white hole. Previous estimates suggest that the lifetime of the resulting white hole scales as $M^4$. In this short note, I argue that such estimates neglect key aspects of the white hole's internal dynamics, and I demonstrate that a more consistent timescale for the white hole lifetime is of order $M^5$.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation Precision with Geocentric Gravitational Wave Interferometers: Monochromatic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Fisher information matrix study of the parameter estimation precision achievable by a class of future space-based, "mid-band", gravitational wave (GW) interferometers observing monochromatic signals. The mid-band is the frequency region between that accessible by LISA and ground-based interferometers. We analyze monochromatic signals from TianQin, gLISA, and gLISA$_d$, a descoped gLISA which has acceleration noise three orders of magnitude worse than gLISA. We find that all three missions achieve their best angular source reconstruction precision in the higher part of their accessible frequency band, with an error box better than $10^{-10}$ sr in the frequency band [$10^{-1},10$] Hz when observing a monochromatic GW signal of amplitude $h_0=10^{-21}$ that is incoming from a given direction. In terms of their reconstructed frequencies and amplitudes, TianQin achieves its best precision values in both quantities in the frequency band [$10^{-2}, 4\times 10^{-1}$] Hz, with a frequency precision $\sigma_{f_{gw}}=2\times 10^{-11}$ Hz and an amplitude precision $\sigma_{h_0}=2\times 10^{-24}$. gLISA matches these precisions in a frequency band slightly higher than that of TianQin, [$3\times 10^{-2},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its smaller arm length. gLISA$_d$, on the other hand, matches the performance of gLISA only over the narrower frequency region, [$7\times 10^{-1},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its higher acceleration noise at lower frequencies. The angular, frequency, and amplitude precisions as functions of the source sky location are derived assuming an average SNR of 10 at selected GW frequencies within TianQin and gLISA's bands. The same is done for gLISA$_d$ using amplitudes yielding an SNR of 10 for gLISA. We find that, for any given source location, all three missions display a marked precision improvement in the three reconstructed parameters at higher GW frequencies.</description>

      <title>Conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories: A critical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the recent result that the action of matter fields is conformal form-invariant in its standard form and on the active and passive approaches to conformal transformations, we review the conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories. We investigate whether this parametrization is actually different from other existing parametrizations. We also check the accuracy of the claim that the classical physical predictions of these theories are conformal-frame invariants.</description>

      <title>Shadow radius and classical scattering analysis of two secondary hair Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the shadow radius analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) and the naked singularity (NS) with secondary scalar hair obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. For this analysis, we include the beyond Horndeski black hole (bH) with secondary scalar hair and the magnetically charged black hole (MC) found from the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory.
  It is worth noting that the NS versions of CHB and bH arise from the charge extension of their photon spheres, while there is no NS version for MC.
  One branch (i) from the CHB is a point in the horizon realization but it shows up on the photon sphere and shadow radius.
  The shadow radius for the CHB is the nearly same as that for the MC with a single horizon and the charge of the NS is constrained by the EHT obserbation.
  From classical scattering analysis, it turns out that i-NS branch and NS play different roles from CHB, bH, and MC.</description>

      <title>Testing black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter environment using quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the quasinormal modes (QNMs) characteristics of charged black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) environment. Based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87* black hole shadow, we implemented necessary constraints on the parameter space($a/M$,$\lambda/M$).We found that for lower values of the magnetic charge parameter, the effective range of the PFDM parameter is approximately between -0.2 and 0, while as the magnetic charge parameter increases, this effective range gradually extends toward more negative values. Then through sixth-order WKB method and time-domain method, we systematically analyzed the quasinormal oscillation spectra under scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. The results reveal that: the magnetic charge $a$ and PFDM parameters $\lambda$ modulate the effective potential barrier of black hole spacetime, profoundly influencing the response frequency and energy dissipation characteristics of external perturbations. The consistently negative imaginary part of QNMs across the entire physical parameter domain substantiates the dynamical stability of the investigated system. Moreover, we discovered differences in the parameter variation sensitivity between scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations, providing a theoretical basis for distinguishing different field disturbances. These results not only unveil the modulation mechanisms of electromagnetic interactions and dark matter distribution on black hole spacetime structures but also offer potential observational evidence for future gravitational wave detection and black hole environment identification.</description>

      <title>Fractional Time-Delayed differential equations: Applications in Cosmological Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine time-delayed differential equations, discussing first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We derive their characteristic equations and solve them using the Laplace transform. We derive a modified evolution equation for the Hubble parameter incorporating a viscosity term modeled as a function of the delayed Hubble parameter within Eckart's theory. We extend this equation using the last-step method of fractional calculus, resulting in Caputo's time-delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the application of the Lee-Yang phase transition theorem to the realm of AdS black hole thermodynamics, thereby deriving a comprehensive complex phase diagram for such systems. Our research augments extant studies on black hole thermodynamic phase diagrams, particularly in the regime above the critical point, by delineating the Widom line of AdS black holes. This boundary segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the thermodynamic crossover within the supercritical region, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamic state functions. The Widom line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.</description>

      <title>Rainbow gravity effects on Klein-Gordon particles in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the Bonnor-Melvin domain walls background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in a quantized nonuniform magnetic field in the background of Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. In the process, we show that the BM spacetime introduces domain walls (i.e., infinitely impenetrable hard walls) at \(r = 0\) and \(r = \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\), as a consequence of the effective gravitational potential field generated by such a magnetized BM spacetime. As a result, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely within the range \(r \in [0, \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\), and the particles and antiparticles cannot be found elsewhere. Next, we provide a conditionally exact solution in the form of the general Heun function \(H_G(a, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, z)\). Within the BM domain walls and under the condition of exact solvability, we study the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the BM spacetime background. We use three pairs of rainbow functions: \( f(u) = (1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|)^{-1}, \, h(u) = 1 \); and \( f(u) = 1, \, h(u) = \sqrt{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|^\upsilon} \), with \(\upsilon = 1,2\), where \(u = |E| / E_p\), \(\tilde{\beta} = \beta / E_p\), and \(\beta\) is the rainbow parameter. We find that such pairs of rainbow functions, \((f(u), h(u))\), fully comply with the theory of rainbow gravity, ensuring that \(E_p\) is the maximum possible energy for particles and antiparticles alike. Moreover, we show that the corresponding bosonic states form magnetized, rotating vortices, as intriguing consequences of such a magnetized BM spacetime background.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore spacetime torsion in a two-dimensional setting, wherein it corresponds to a vector field. Without invoking field equations of a particular gravitational theory, we develop visualization techniques for such torsion fields, consider a generalization of Killing vectors to the presence of torsion, and find explicit representations of such Killing vectors (and their generalized algebra) in the presence of constant torsion. We then utilize these structures to derive general properties of surface gravities of static black holes whose near-horizon region features approximately constant torsion fields. Under certain assumptions, the two-dimensional results can be lifted to four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in non-perturbative quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String field theory motivated infinite-derivative models lead to non-local gravity modifications which form a promising class of quantum gravity candidates. In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the three-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is done in an Einstein frame with an infinite-derivative scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. A non-local generalization of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is derived. Infinite-derivative operators present in this equation lead to an appearance of infinitely many new background induced states in the perturbation spectrum during inflation with complex masses on top of a usual nearly massless inflaton. On contrary to a flat background such states can be classically stable in a de Sitter space-time. This helps preserving observational constraints on the scalar power-spectrum. We proceed by studying a particular configuration assuming that the generalized Mukhanov-Sasaki equation gives rise to an inflaton and one pair of new states with complex conjugate masses as perturbative degrees of freedom. The corresponding scalar bi-spectrum is computed numerically in squeezed and equilateral limits. We use the latest observational constraints on amplitude of the bi-spectrum $f_{NL}$ from Planck 2018 dataset as a guideline for possible values of masses of new emerging states. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially sensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter space of gravity modifications. In particular we find that the amplitude of the squeezed limit gets easily enhanced while of the equilateral limit can stay like in a local single-field model of inflation. We end up discussing open questions relevant for this class of models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Black hole quasinormal mode resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal mode frequencies can be very close to each other ("avoided crossings") or even completely degenerate ("exceptional points") when the system is characterized by more than one parameter. We investigate this resonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes are just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We also study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the frequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at resonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We carry out a numerical study of resonances between the fundamental mode and the first overtone in a specific toy model. We find that quasinormal mode frequencies will not be accurately constrained unless we take into account the effect of resonances.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Baryogenesis in Extended Proca-Nuevo Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in the framework of Extended Proca-Nuevo (EPN) gravity, a theory where a massive vector field is non-minimally coupled to the curvature. This analysis is carried out for an early universe, encompassing three separate cosmological scenarios defined by power-law, exponential, and modified exponential scale factors. By deriving the modified field equations from the EPN action, we obtain precise solutions for each scale factor, including the influence of the vector field. We compute the baryon-to-entropy ratio using the gravitational baryogenesis formalism, where the baryon asymmetry arises from a dynamical coupling of the baryon current with the derivative of the Ricci scalar. Our findings demonstrate that the baryon-to-entropy ratio is consistent with observational constraints in all scenarios, highlighting the potential of EPN gravity as a viable theory to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the early universe. The study further stresses the contribution of anisotropy and vector field dynamics to the cosmological evolution within modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole solution in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet $4d$ gravitational model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the sEGB $4d$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right))$, a Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the usual scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper, the sEGB reconstruction procedure considered in our previous paper is applied to the metric of the Bronnikov-Ellis solution, which describes a massive wormhole in the model with a phantom field (and zero potential). For this metric, written in the Buchdal parameterization with a radial variable $u$, we find a solution of the master equation for $ f\left(\varphi\left(u\right)\right)$ with the integration (reconstruction) parameter $C_0$. We also find expressions for $U\left(\varphi\left(u\right)\right)$ and $\varepsilon \dot{\varphi} = h\left(u\right)$ for $\varepsilon = \pm 1$. We prove that for all non-trivial values of the parameter $C_0 \neq 0$ the function $h\left(u\right)$ is not of constant sign for all admissible $u \in \left(-\infty , +\infty\right)$. This means that for a fixed value of the parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ there is no non-trivial sEGB reconstruction in which the scalar field is a purely ordinary field ($\varepsilon = 1$) or a purely phantom field ($\varepsilon = - 1$).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that the second-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling $\sim t^{-2\ell-3}$. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of black holes with cloud of strings and quintessence via Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00416v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence to study thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology in the presence of Barrow entropy, which is currently being used widely as the horizon of a black hole may not be a smooth surface as described in classical general relativity but instead could have a more intricate fractal-like structure. Here, we study the impact of the fractal correction parameter of Barrow entropy on the thermodynamics of such BHs. We compute the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr relation for RN-AdS black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence in terms of Barrow entropy by employing the generalized formula for spherically symmetric spacetime which is directly derived from the Einstein field equation. The significance of Barrow entropy has been verified from thermodynamic topology as well. We also found that the non-zero topological charge indicates the presence of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Resonant amplification of multi-messenger emission in rotating stellar core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations extending up to $\sim 2\,\mathrm{s}$, we identify a regime of pre-collapse central rotation rates ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Hz}$) that greatly enhances the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) during extended periods of time after bounce. The enhancement is a consequence of the resonance between the frequency of the fundamental quadrupolar $^2f$-mode of oscillation of the proto-neutron star and the frequency of the epicyclic oscillations at the boundary of the inner core. We observe periods of about several hundred milliseconds each where the resonance is active. The GW emission enhancement produces a correlated resonant modulation of the associated neutrino signal at the same frequencies. With GW frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{kHz})$ and strain amplitudes within the sensitivity curves of current and next-generation interferometers at distances of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{Mpc})$, this resonant-amplification mechanism may represent a potential game-changer for unveiling the supernova explosion mechanism through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations are symmetries of electromagnetism that are canonically conjugate to the standard $\mathcal O(1)$ angle-dependent $u(1)$ transformations. They were exhibited a few years ago at spatial infinity. In this paper, we derive their explicit form at null infinity. We also derive the expression there of the associated "conserved" surface integrals. To that end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of the electromagnetic vector potential $A_\mu$ in the vicinity of null infinity for generic initial conditions given on a Cauchy hypersurface. This behaviour is given by a polylogarithmic expansion involving both gauge-invariant logarithmic terms also present in the field strengths and gauge-variant logarithmic terms with physical content, which we identify. We show on which explicit terms, and how, do the logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations act. Other results of this paper are a derivation of the matching conditions for the Goldstone boson and for the conserved charges of the angle-dependent $u(1)$ asymptotic symmetries, as well as a clarification of a misconception concerning the non-existence of these angle-dependent $u(1)$ charges in the presence of logarithms at null infinity. We also briefly comment on higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), produced by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), offers a unique probe of their cosmic evolution. Using our recently proposed technique, we investigate the prospect of discovering the SMBHB population and its evolution by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy observation by exploring their cross-correlation. Using a Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that the SGWB power spectrum alone can provide only a weak measurement of the cosmic genealogy of SMBHBs, while the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution can significantly improve our measurement and open a discovery space. With a PTA of 2000 pulsars, achievable in the SKA era, we find that the redshift evolution of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and galaxy stellar mass can be measured with an SNR up to 4 in the redshift range up to three. The frequency distribution can be constrained with an SNR of approximately up to 80 in the same redshift range at a frequency range accessible from nHz. These SNRs improve further with the increase in the number of pulsars to 5000 expected from SKA. This demonstrates the prospect of answering the decades-long unsolved problem of SMBH growth and evolution over cosmic time and shedding new insights on the standard model of cosmology using synergy between nHz GW and galaxy surveys.</description>

Abstract: I revisit Roberto Torretti's "Spacetime Models for the World" [SHPMP 31 (2):171-186 (2000)] in the light of more recent work in (philosophy of) cosmology. I discuss the motivations for FLRW spacetimes as a natural starting point for inquiry, and I suggest contemporary cosmologists can avoid the rationalism that Torretti attributes to Einstein's early work in relativistic cosmology. I then discuss the senses in which FLRW models are idealized, and I show how those idealizations (and partial de-idealizations) have contributed to our understanding of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of physical theories whose dynamics are given by natural equations, which are partial differential equations determined by a functor from the category of n-manifolds, for some n, to the category of fiber bundles, satisfying certain further conditions. We show how the theory of natural equations clarifies several important foundational issues, including the status and meaning of minimal coupling, symmetries of theories, and background structure. We also state and prove a fundamental result about the initial value problem for natural equations.</description>

      <title>On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black hole in OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully monitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a period of $\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine description for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMBH, to explain the {\it observed} decay of SMBH binary orbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements, and OJ~287's orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH binary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced dynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper bound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally derived value, as argued by \cite{Chan2024}.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations suffer from divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of inflaton decay rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}&lt;10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open new windows for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.</description>

      <title>Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to inflation beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show that neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds to discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large scales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales due to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the case of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.</description>

      <title>Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings Higgs-like inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. Remarkably, we find that this can be achieved with non-minimal couplings $\xi &lt; 1$, in contrast to the large values typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any unitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</description>

      <title>Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of primordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level of the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT predictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the EFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial oscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the well-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation processes. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy power spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to derive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work highlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios on scales that complement CMB observations.</description>

This result, together with the well-known equivalence between timelike Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci lower bounds and the $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ condition, and the fact that $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ spaces support the timelike Brunn-Minkowski inequality, draws an equivalence between $\mathsf{TBM}(K,N)$ and $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ in the smooth setting.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

Abstract: Recently, two models of quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-like black holes were developed within Effective Quantum Gravity, and the spectra of bosonic perturbations have been analyzed in several recent studies. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a massless Dirac field perturbations around these black holes. By employing the higher-order WKB method and time-domain integration, we achieved consistency between the two approaches within their common range of validity. This concordance enables us to distinguish the two quantum-corrected black hole models from each other and from their Schwarzschild limit through their quasinormal spectra. In addition, we find approximate analytic expressions for quasinormal modes and grey-body factors in the form of expansion beyond the eikonal limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new way to handle interactions between two scalar fields in the cosmological backdrop where one scalar field oscillates rapidly in the cosmological time scale while the other does not show any periodic behavior in the same time scale. We have interpreted the rapidly oscillating scalar field as the dark matter candidate while the other scalar field is supposed to be the canonical quintessence field or the non-canonical phantom field. A model of a generalized top-hat-like collapse is developed where the dark sector is composed of the aforementioned scalar fields. We show how the non-minimal coupling in the dark sector affects the gravitational collapse of a slightly overdense spherical patch of the universe. The results show that one can have both unclustered and clustered dark energy in such collapses, the result depends upon the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter (DM), are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we examine the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by the future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate wormhole geometries with multiple throats and anti-throats in general relativity. The existence of these structures is identified through the analysis of minima and maxima in the area of the solution. Using embedding diagrams, we visualize the geometry and demonstrate that these objects exhibit a complex structure, distinct from standard single-throat wormholes. We further analyze the geodesic motion in such spacetimes. The solutions are derived from Einstein's equations by coupling a phantom scalar field to nonlinear electrodynamics, and we show that distinct scalar field profiles can generate the same spacetime geometry. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions and demonstrate that, for specific parameter choices, all energy conditions can be partially satisfied in certain regions of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We report on the potential occurrence of a numerical instability in the long-time simulation of black holes using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation of numerical relativity, even in the simple set-up of a Schwarzschild black hole. Through extensive numerical experiments, we identify that this "late-time instability" arises from accumulated violations of the momentum constraint. To address this issue, we propose two modified versions of the so-called conformal covariant Z4 scheme, designed to propagate momentum constraint violations without damping. Our results demonstrate that these alternative formulations, which we refer to as CCZ4' and CCZ3, effectively resolve the late-time numerical instability not only in Schwarzschild spacetimes but also in black hole spacetimes with matter fields. Notably, by preventing damping of the momentum constraint violation, the Hamiltonian constraint damping can be significantly increased, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing long-term evolution in our proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Active and Passive Conformal Transformations in Scalar-Tensor Gravitational Theories</title>

Abstract: Through considering the conformal transformations as coordinate transformations in some abstract space of fields, where the different fields are assumed as ``generalized coordinates,'' we introduce the notion of active and passive conformal transformations. We then apply both complementary approaches to the conformal frames issue, arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, in order to get better understanding of the problem. Special focus is on the coupling of matter fields to gravity. The recent result that the Lagrangian density of fundamental matter fields and perfect fluids, in its standard form, is not only conformal invariant but also conformal form-invariant, is taken into consideration in the discussion about the conformal frames issue.</description>

      <title>Detectability of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Information Across the Horizon</title>

Abstract: The effect of black holes on entanglement harvesting has been of considerable interest over the past decade. Research involving stationary Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors near a (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has uncovered phenomena such as entanglement shadows, entanglement amplification through black hole rotation, and differences between bipartite and tripartite entanglement. For a (1+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, it has been shown that two infalling UDW detectors can harvest entanglement from the scalar quantum vacuum even when separated by an event horizon. In this paper, we calculate the mutual information between two UDW detectors coupled to a massless quantum scalar field, with the detectors starting at rest and falling radially into a non-rotating (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. The trajectory of the detectors includes regions where both detectors are switched on outside of the horizon; where one detector is switched on inside of the horizon while the other switches on outside; and where both detectors switch on inside of the horizon. We investigate different black hole masses, detector energy gaps, widths and temporal separations of the detector switching functions, and field boundary conditions. We find that black holes--even the simplest kind having constant curvature--significantly affect the correlation properties of quantum fields in the vacuum state. These correlations, both outside and inside the horizon, can be mapped out by infalling detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. We analyze the impact of the transition rate on the scalar potential. We find that the finite transition duration suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the scalar potential, consequently suppressing the amplitude of the GW energy spectrum. By numerically solving the background and perturbation equations, we demonstrate that the physically motivated models, such as the evaporation of primordial black holes and the decay of Q-balls, cannot produce an observable GW signal.</description>

      <title>Simplified functional flow equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Our setting is based on a particular choice of cutoff function which depends on the macroscopic fields. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Probing a nonminimal coupling through superhorizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by Planck and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Spacetime I: The Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We focus on Minkowski spacetime proving that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. We remark that this result can be extended to arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes, although, in this case one needs to exploit the existing regularization freedom in the construction of the Wick ordered stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assumption of a flat Universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been rarely tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, specifically those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the asymptotic symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their finite-distance counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called soft edges, extend to asymptotia and, in fact, realize the corner charge algebra in multiple ways, for example, by "pulling in" the asymptotic one from infinity, or physically through the addition of asymptotic soft and hard radiation. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of soft boundary conditions, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational quasi-local one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is frame-dependent; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory.</description>

Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) coupling constant, and the charge density affect the chaotic properties of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and compute the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Due to the relevant deformation in the boundary theory induced by a bulk scalar field, the bulk solution flows to a more general Kasner spacetime near the black hole singularity. We examine the behavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly velocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation. We find that as the deformation parameter increases, the ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent to the surface gravity decreases. For sufficiently large deformation, the Lyapunov exponent in the deformed geometry can exceed that of the axion Reissner-Nordstrom case. We observe that boundary deformation generally reduces the scrambling time delay, with the EMS coupling having a significant effect on the delay. These results provide further insight into the role of boundary deformations in modifying chaotic properties in charged hairy black holes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the black hole photon sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <title>Effective action for $\phi^4$-Yukawa theory via 2PI formalism in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction, Yukawa coupled to fermions in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime background. The scalar has a classical background plus quantum fluctuations, whereas the fermions are taken to be quantum. We derive for this system the effective action and the effective potential via the two particle irreducible (2PI) formalism. This formalism provides an opportunity to find out resummed or non-perturbative expressions for some series of diagrams. We have considered the two loop vacuum graphs and have computed the local part of the effective action. The various resummed counterterms corresponding to self energies, vertex functions and the tadpole have been explicitly found out. The variation of the renormalised effective potential for massless fields has been investigated numerically. We show that for the potential to be bounded from below, we must have $\lambda \gtrsim 16 g^2$, where $\lambda$ and $g$ are respectively the quartic and Yukawa couplings. We emphasise the qualitative differences of this non-perturbative calculation with that of the standard 1PI perturbative ones in de Sitter. The qualitative differences of our result with that of the flat spacetime has also been pointed out.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.</description>
