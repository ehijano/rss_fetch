      <title>Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like evolution of a nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Dark Energy with Bright Standard Sirens from Future Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Power Law Plateau Inflation and Primary Gravitational Waves in the light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Power-Law Plateau (PLP) inflation in standard gravity and its consistency with ACT DR6 data. While many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky inflation, are disfavored by ACT observations, the PLP potential remains viable across a broad range of its parameters. Then, the dynamics of the reheating phase are investigated, where we mainly focus on the reheating temperature and its relationship with the inflationary phase and primordial gravitational waves. Incorporating the overproduction of the primordial gravitational waves can affect the effective number of relativistic species during the bounce. The constraint data on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature. This constraint will be more efficient for a stiff equation of state. It is determined that for $\omega_{re} &gt; 0.58$, this constraint would be efficient. Combining the result of the reheating temperature and the inflationary phase, it is concluded that to have both a viable result standing in $1\sigma$ of ACT DR6 and also to satisfy the reheating lower bound, the total number of e-folds during the inflationary phase should be $N_k \lesssim 62$. Higher e-folds of expansion result in a reheating temperature below the bound, which is disfavored. Finally, for the constraint values of the reheating temperature, the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves has been explored. The results indicate that there is a higher chance of detection for lower reheating temperatures and higher reheating equation of state.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian catalog of 100 high-significance voids in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at https://voids.cosmictwin.org/, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

      <title>Model-independent observational constraints with fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters using two model-independent methods: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with type Ia supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+DESI gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below 1\%. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. Besides, the DESI DR2 dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating an accuracy of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI, and CC datasets provide tighter constraints, e.g., $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. Notably, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a $1\sigma$ confidence level. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 &lt; 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.</description>

      <title>Road through Dark$\nu$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Detection Bands for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries: Prospects for LISA and AMIGO in General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi analytic forecast for the detection of intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries with the space based detectors LISA (millihertz band) and AMIGO (deci hertz band). A redshift dependent population model is built from extrapolated black hole mass functions and realistic pairing and merger time scales. Folding this population through the instrument sensitivities yields event rates of about 1e4 mergers for LISA in four observing years and between 1e2 and 1e3 mergers for AMIGO in three years, with complementary optimal detection bands in total mass and redshift.
  We then incorporate the minimal matter coupled modified gravity model f(R,T) = R + 2 lambda T. In this scenario the strain amplitude is rescaled by (1 - lambda / 8 pi)^(5/6) while the waveform phasing is unchanged at leading order. For Solar System compatible couplings abs(lambda) &lt;= 2 x 10^-3, the peak detection redshift shifts by less than one percent and the total number of events changes by less than five percent. Combined statistics from LISA and AMIGO therefore provide a consistency check on f(R,T) gravity without spoiling standard IMBH forecasts.</description>

Abstract: We will present the way to derive a de Sitter inflationary solution within the so-called Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity. Then, we will show by using the dynamical system method whether the obtained solution is stable or not. According to the stability of the de Sitter inflationary solution, we could judge which phase of our universe, among the two early and late-time phases, is more appropriate for this solution.</description>

      <title>Resonant Landau-Zener Conversion In Multi-Axion Systems</title>

Abstract: Multiple axions may emerge in the low-energy effective theory of Nature. Generically, the potentials describing these axion fields are non-diagonal, leading to mass mixing between axion states which can be temperature-dependent due to QCD instanton effects. As the temperature of the Universe drops, level crossing can occur, causing resonant conversion between axion states. In this work, we present an analytic study of the cosmological evolution of multi-axion systems including adiabatic and non-adiabatic resonant conversion from one axion state into another during the misalignment process. We show how the Landau-Zener formalism accurately captures the non-adiabatic resonant conversion, permitting an analytic description of the relic abundances of each axion field for nearly any arbitrary two-state axion mass matrix. As an application, we study the mixing of a QCD axion with an axion-like-particle for specific potentials to identify the predictions for haloscope experiments. We conclude that the detection of an axion off the expected QCD mass-coupling line predicts other haloscope targets if it mixes with the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Introducing NewCluster: the first half of the history of a high-resolution cluster simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.</description>

      <title>The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: An integral field unit-based integrated molecular gas database for galaxy evolution studies in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.</description>

      <title>AXES-SDSS: Solving the puzzle of X-ray emission of optical galaxy groups via a modified Hausdorff distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of X-ray and CMB sources as galaxy groups and clusters is a prerequisite for cluster cosmology. But the identification of groups, especially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect the purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given either by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the cluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can describe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations, it is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership assignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore there is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification procedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a fixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500, to the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We used the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and completeness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the optical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides 90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the optical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and the completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby groups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as 200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups follow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between the optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack of matches in previous studies. Instead, the problem is caused by over-merging in the optical group catalog construction and source confusion in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>The Nineteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Source Clustering from Supermassive Binary Black Holes Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), but the origin of this gravitational wave (GW) signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from cosmological simulation, we generate multiple realizations of a mock observable universe that self-consistently incorporates the cosmic large-scale structure, enabling a robust statistical analysis of SMBBH populations and their GW signatures. We systematically investigate the merger event distributions and both the isotropic and anisotropic properties of the resulting GWB signals under different hardening timescales. Specifically, we calculate the characteristic amplitude of the GWB signal, and the angular power spectrum for both the total energy density and energy density in different frequency bins accounting for cosmic variance through different realizations. We also study the clustering pattern of the positional distribution of SMBBHs to examine whether they can reproduce the large-scale structure of galaxies. Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-PTA, we predict the numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions of resolvable individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR$&gt;$8. We finally investigated the impact of weak lensing effects and found that their influence on the basic characteristics of the GWB signal and individual sources is rather limited.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Mass Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies at high redshift, challenging the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. Previous studies alleviated this tension with a blue tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm cMpc}^{-1}$). In this study, we examine whether the blue tilted model can boost dark matter substructures especially at low redshift, thereby addressing other potential challenges to the standard cosmology. First, substructures in the standard cosmological model may not be sufficient to explain the anomalous flux ratio problem observed in strong gravitational lensing. Second, the number of observed nearby satellite galaxies could be higher than the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmology, after completeness correction and tidal stripping by baryonic disks. To study the impact of a blue tilted primordial power spectrum on substructures, we perform high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host mass halos, evolving to redshift $z=0$. At $z=0$, we find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10} ~M\odot$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>Going beyond $S_8$: fast inference of the matter power spectrum from weak-lensing surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys are often summarized by constraints on the derived parameter ${S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$, obscuring the rich scale and redshift information encoded in the data, and limiting our ability to identify the origin of any tensions with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference, employing multipoles up to $\ell_{\rm max}\sim2000$ for the galaxy lensing surveys. Our results show a consistent 15-30% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim 0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to a Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction with a CDM-only (no baryonic feedback) power spectrum, with combined tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$. This is under a fixed cosmology and with analytic marginalization over shear and redshift calibration uncertainties. In contrast, ACT CMB lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived likelihoods are publicly released. Our results highlight the importance of reporting lensing constraints on $P(k, z)$ and pave the way for model-agnostic test of growth of structure with upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>GetDist: a Python package for analysing Monte Carlo samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo techniques, including MCMC and other methods, are widely used in Bayesian inference to generate sets of samples from a parameter space of interest. The Python GetDist package provides tools for analysing these samples and calculating marginalized one- and two-dimensional densities using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Many Monte Carlo methods produce correlated and/or weighted samples, for example produced by MCMC, nested, or importance sampling, and there can be hard boundary priors. GetDist's baseline method consists of applying a linear boundary kernel, and then using multiplicative bias correction. The smoothing bandwidth is selected automatically following Botev et al., based on a mixture of heuristics and optimization results using the expected scaling with an effective number of samples (defined here to account for both MCMC correlations and weights). Two-dimensional KDE uses an automatically-determined elliptical Gaussian kernel for correlated distributions. The package includes tools for producing a variety of publication-quality figures using a simple named-parameter interface, as well as a graphical user interface that can be used for interactive exploration. It can also calculate convergence diagnostics, produce tables of limits, and output in LaTeX, and is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Composite heavy axion-like dark matter</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel class of Dark Matter (DM) candidates in the form of a heavy composite Axion-Like Particle (ALP) with highly suppressed electromagnetic interactions populating vast yet unexplored domains in the ALP parameter space. This is achieved for the first time in the simplest dark confining gauge theory yielding a new composite glueball ALP (GALP) DM coupling-mass relation found in terms of two distinct fundamental scales -- the large dark fermion mass scale and the dynamical scale of dark confinement. The presence of a heavy fermion portal between the visible (photons) and dark (GALPs) sectors ensures a strong radiative suppression of the GALP-photon coupling naturally without any fine-tuning. The observable features of heavy GALP DM in a minimal realization are controlled by only three physical parameters. Our work paves the road for a novel research field exploring the theory and phenomenology of composite ALPs in multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog with the Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic redshift distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs as a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the redshift distribution of the CHIME/FRB catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population, i.e. intrinsic redshift distribution of FRB. Taking uncertainties within the observational data and selection effects into consideration, we obtained that the redshift distribution of FRBs is significantly delayed with respect to that of the star formation history.</description>

      <title>Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Complementary Probes of Warped Extra Dimension: Colliders, Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) produced by the supercooled radion phase transition (PT) in warped extra-dimension models solving the gauge hierarchy problem. We first determine how the SGWB and the produced PBH mass and abundance depend on the warped model's infrared energy scale $\rho$, and the number of holographic colors $N$. With this finding, we recast on the plane $\{\rho, N\}$ the current SGWB and PBH constraints, as well as the expected parameter reaches of GW detectors, as LISA and ET, and the gravitational lensing ones, such as NGRST. On the same plane, we also map the collider bounds on massive graviton production, and cosmological bounds on the radion phenomenology. We find that, for $N \sim 10-50$, the considered PT predicts a PBH population mass in the range $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(10^{-1} - 10^{-25}) M_{\odot}$ for $\rho \sim (10^{-4} - 10^{8})\textrm{ TeV}$. In the range $\rho \simeq (0.05 - 0.5)$ GeV, it can explain the recent SGWB hint at nHz frequencies and generate PBH binaries with mass $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(0.1 - 1 ) M_\odot$ detectable at LISA and ET. The experimentally allowed mass region where PBHs can account for the whole dark matter abundance, and are produced with a tuning $\lesssim 10^{-4}$, corresponds to $10$ TeV $\lesssim \rho\lesssim$ $10^4$ TeV. These PBHs can compensate the lack of natural candidates for dark matter in warped extra dimensional models. Such a region represents a great science case where forthcoming and future colliders like HE-LHC and FCC-hh, gravitational-wave observatories and other PBHs probes play a key complementary role.</description>

      <title>Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>
