      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Bio-Inspired Algorithms: Taxonomy, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms (BIAs) utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. This survey categorizes BIAs into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their core principles, strengths, and limitations. We illustrate the usage of these algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of bio-inspired computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Genetic Optimization for Patient Scheduling in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the recent decades, quantum-inspired variants are known for fast and high-fitness convergence and small resource requirement. Here the application to the patient scheduling problem in proton therapy is reported. Quantum chromosomes are tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses. Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex. Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation. Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic algorithm.</description>

      <title>NEAT and HyperNEAT based Design for Soft Actuator Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since soft robotics are composed of compliant materials, they perform better than conventional rigid robotics in specific fields, such as medical applications. However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically, the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.</description>

      <title>Spore in the Wild: Case Study on Spore.fun, a Real-World Experiment of Sovereign Agent Open-ended Evolution on Blockchain with TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.</description>

      <title>The GAIN Model: A Nature-Inspired Neural Network Framework Based on an Adaptation of the Izhikevich Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model, allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Gradient Training: A novel training paradigm for bridging the gap between deep neural networks and physical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.</description>

      <title>Stein Variational Evolution Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a highly efficient method to sample from an unnormalized probability distribution. However, the SVGD update relies on gradients of the log-density, which may not always be available. Existing gradient-free versions of SVGD make use of simple Monte Carlo approximations or gradients from surrogate distributions, both with limitations. To improve gradient-free Stein variational inference, we combine SVGD steps with evolution strategy (ES) updates. Our results demonstrate that the resulting algorithm generates high-quality samples from unnormalized target densities without requiring gradient information. Compared to prior gradient-free SVGD methods, we find that the integration of the ES update in SVGD significantly improves the performance on multiple challenging benchmark problems.</description>
