      <title>On the momentum of gluons in Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to improve LGT simulation algorithms by Fourier space preconditioning have been handicapped by the gauge dependence of momenta, familiar from perturbation theory. The continuum theory has a gauge invariant energy-momentum density, indicating this to be a fake obstacle. While perturbation-theory momenta are evidently wrong for the task, momentum-transfer carried by gluons is physical. Simulations using these momenta may become practical in the near future thanks to recent progress in generative models, stochastic and/or deterministic.</description>

      <title>Realization of all-to-all fermion propagator for the first principle high accuracy strong interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a ``blending" algorithm that projects the all-to-all fermion propagator onto spatial low-frequency modes (LFM) combined with a stochastic estimate of spatial high-frequency modes (SHFM) at each time slice. This approach enables the calculation of arbitrary-point correlation functions for arbitrary hadron states in strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFT) with fermions, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, LFM allows the construction of spatially extended hadron states below a certain energy threshold by diagonalizing multi-fermion interpolation fields. Meanwhile, the local interactions required for N-point correlation functions in QFT can be approximated in an unbiased manner through a reweighted summation of both LFM and SHFM contributions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, we obtained {\color{black} $g_A^u=0.895(15)$, $g_A^d=-0.338(15)$, $g_A^s=-0.0245(72)$, $g_A^{u+d+s}=0.533(28)$ and $g_A^{u-d}=1.2339(43)$ } for nucleon at $m_{\pi}=300$ MeV and $a=0.077$ fm using 40 configurations. The consistency check of the pion electric form factor and charge radius derived from 3-point and 4-point correlation functions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations based on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the resource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupled-channel models for hadron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. For the same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$ lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster. The trend is expected to persist to larger lattices, which are of particular interest, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Strong Interaction origin of Baryon Masses with Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both the Higgs mechanism and strong interactions contribute to the masses of visible matter, yet how the six Higgs-generated quark masses and uniform strong interaction strength determine the hundreds of hadron masses remains unclear. Additionally, the role of massless, flavor-neutral gluons on hadron mass formation is central to the unresolved Millennium Prize problem on the mass gap in Yang-Mills theory. Addressing these questions requires advanced simulations on state-of-the-art supercomputers using Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which offers a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of QCD solvable numerically. Here we present first-principles lattice QCD calculations using comprehensive gauge ensembles that accurately predict ground state spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryon masses with light, strange, and charm quarks within 1\% of experimental values. At the \(\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\) 2 GeV scale, our results unveil two fundamental mass generation mechanisms for those baryon masses in QCD: 1) the flavor-dependent enhancement of Higgs contributions, 4-8 for light, 2-3 for strange, and 1.2-1.3 for charm quarks; and 2) the flavor-insensitive contribution 0.8-1.2 GeV from gluon quantum anomaly. This breakthrough significantly advances our comprehension of strong interaction dynamics and the genesis of visible matter's mass.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>
