      <title>Linear Equations in the Ring of $\mathcal{S}\left(\mathcal{A}\right)$-Linearly Correlated Fuzzy Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the solutions of a family of certain linear fuzzy arithmetic equations that involve fuzzy numbers belonging to certain finite-dimensional vector spaces of $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{F}}$, called $\mathcal{S}\left(\mathcal{A}\right)$-linearly correlated fuzzy numbers. Here, $\A$ stands for a strongly linearly independent (SLI) set of fuzzy numbers. The arithmetic operations in the aforementioned linear equations are the sum in the vector space $\Sc(\A)$ and the so-called $\psi$-cross product that turns $\Sc(\A)$ into a commutative ring.</description>

      <title>Computational Resolution of Hadamard Product Factorization for $4 \times 4$ Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of $4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices. Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304 counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over $\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy. Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.</description>

      <title>Prime Radical and Primary decomposition of Ideals in an L subring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the concept of a prime radical of an ideal of an L-ring L(mu,R) . Among various results pertaining to this concept, we prove here that prime radicals of an ideal eta, its radical , its semiprime radical S(eta) and its prime radical P(eta) , all coincide. Also we prove that for a primary ideal, its prime radical coincide with its radical. Moreover, we introduce the concept of primary decomposition and reduced primary decomposition of an ideal in an L-ring. We obtain a necessary and sufficient conditions for an ideal of an L-ring to have a primary decomposition. Some more results pertaining to the decomposition of an ideal are established.</description>

      <title>Quasi-derivations of Witt and related algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we compute quasi-derivations of the Witt algebra and some algebras well-related to the Witt algebra. Namely, we prove that each quasi-derivation of the Witt algebra is a sum of a derivation and a $\frac{1}{2}$-derivation; a similar result is obtained for the Virasoro algebra. A different situation appears for Lie algebras ${\mathcal W}(a,b):$ in the case of $b=-1,$ they do not have interesting examples of quasi-derivations, but the case of $b\neq-1$ provides some new non-trivial examples of quasi-derivations. We also completely describe all quasi-derivations of ${\mathcal W}(a,b).$ As a corollary, we describe the derivations and quasi-derivations of the Novikov-Witt and admissible Novikov-Witt algebras previously constructed by Bai and his co-authors.</description>

      <title>Interplay between $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gradings and automorphisms in the Grassmann algebra: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field of characteristic different from two, and let $E$ be the Grassmann algebra of an infinite-dimensional $F$-vector space $L$. In this paper, we survey recent results concerning automorphisms of order two of $E$ and the corresponding induced superalgebra structures. We also present concrete examples of non-homogeneous automorphisms of $E$, as discussed in \cite{agpkauto, anagomes}. The paper concludes with a conjecture regarding the classification of the superalgebra structures of $E$.</description>

      <title>On hollowness in multiplicative lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to extend the notions of strongly hollow and completely strongly hollow ideals of commutative rings to multiplicative lattices. We investigate their basic structural properties and prove several characterizations in terms of localizations at maximal elements and the behaviour of residuals. In particular, we study properties of strongly hollow elements in various types of $C$-lattices: Gelfand, semi-simple, and Pr\"ufer. We also provide characterizations of quasi-local weak $r$-lattices by completely strongly hollow elements. Furthermore, we give characterization of strongly hollow elements in Noether lattices, and obtain explicit descriptions in Pr\"ufer and $r$-lattices. Using strongly hollow and completely strongly hollow elements, we obtain representabilities of multiplicative lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the second cohomology space for the $n$-th Schr\"{o}dinger algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_n$. We prove that the second cohomology space is vanishing for $n \geq 3$ and show that $\dim(H^2(\mathfrak{sch}_2, \mathfrak{sch}_2)) =2.$ Moreover, we investigate the factor algebra of the Schr\"{o}dinger algebra by its center and determine the second cohomology group of this factor algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complex reflection group \( \mathcal{G} \), identified as No. 8 in the Shephard-Todd classification. In this paper, we present computations of the vector-valued invariants associated with various representations of \( \mathcal{G} \).

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric ($p$)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelf/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both $p$-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts.</description>
