      <title>The Origin of Dark Matter and the Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of exotic charged dust is introduced here to represent dark matter. The term "exotic" means that the dust is not composed of normal matter, and the charge--for lack of a better term--is not an electric charge. It is also shown that the often-used approximate expression for dark matter density corresponds to an exact solution of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations for charged dust. The Einstein field equations tells us is that for a flat universe the cosmological constant acts as a gravitating negative energy distribution that is gravitationally repulsive; following Schwinger, it is shown that the vacuum must have a negative energy spectrum if QFT is to be gauge invariant.</description>

      <title>Wide Binaries, Retardation and the External Field Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low acceleration gravitational anomaly was reported for wide binaries: two binary stars which are separated by more than five kilo astronomical units (kau). The increase in gravitational force was reported to be about $1.37$ greater than Newtonian gravity. At the same time binaries separated less than one kau were shown to obey standard Newtonian gravity. A possible explanation for this was given in the framework of MOND correction to gravity which is applicable for low acceleration. However, it was noticed that the explanation is only adequate in the framework of Milgromian AQUAL theory which considers the "external field effect" that is the effect of the gravitational field of the rest of the galaxy on the binary system. Recently it was shown that many "anomalous gravity" effects can be explained in the framework of general relativity and its weak field approximation. It was shown that anomalous galaxy rotation curves, anomalous gravitational lensing and the Tully-Fisher relations can be understood in terms of retarded gravity. Moreover, the anomalous mass of galaxy clusters derived from the virial theorem was also shown to be a retarded gravity effect. On the other hand, it was shown that retarded effects are not important in the solar system and the correction to the anomalous shift of Mercury's perihelion is connected with the motion of the solar center of mass with respect to the sun and not to retardation. It is desirable to investigate if the wide binary acceleration gravitational anomaly can be explained in the framework of Einstein-Newton general relativity. We show that the scale of five kau separation arises naturally within such a theory if the effect of the galaxy on the wide binary is considered (a Newtonian external field effect) suggesting the anomaly found can be explained without the need to invoke theoretical modifications of the accepted theory.</description>

      <title>Considerations about the measurement of the magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of the electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron $\mu$, is to experimentaly determine the gyromagnetic ratio. The factor $g/2$ is computed by the accurate measurement of two frequencies, the spin precession frequency $\nu_s$, and the cyclotron frequency $\nu_c$, and is defined as $\nu_s/\nu_c=g/2$. These experiments are performed with a single electron confined inside a Penning trap. The existence of the electric dipole moment ${d}_e$, involves the idea of an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin direction such that ${ d}_e=d_e{ S}/(\hbar/2)$. The energy shift $\Delta U=2{d}_eE_{eff}$ of the interaction of the electric dipole of electrons with a huge effective electric field ${E}_{eff}$, close to the nucleus of heavy neutral atoms or molecules, is determined by a spin precession measurement. By using a classical model of a spinning electron, which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized, we determine classically the time average value of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of this electron model when moving in a uniform magnetic field and in a Penning trap, with the same fields as in the real experiments, and obtain an estimated value of these dipoles. We compare these results with the experimental data and make some interpretation of the measured dipoles.</description>
