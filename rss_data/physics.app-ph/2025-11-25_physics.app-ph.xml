      <title>Validation of the copper equation of state via shock loading experiments of loosely associated powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity shock experiments were performed on copper powders with controlled porosity via improved target fabrication and assembly. Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T &gt; 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Passive mechanical logic via topology-optimized acoustic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing energy demands of modern digital devices necessitate alternative, low-power computing mechanisms. When incident loads take the form of acoustic or vibrational waves, the ability to mechanically process information eliminates the need for transduction, paving the way for passive computing. Recent studies have proposed systems that learn and execute mechanical logic through buckling, bistability, and origami-inspired lattices. However, owing to the large timescales of shape morphing, such concepts suffer from slow operation or require active stimulation of adaptive materials. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach to mechanical logic, leveraging the rich dynamics of wave propagation in elastic structures. In lieu of traditional forward-design tools, such as band diagrams and transmission spectra, we employ a multi-faceted topology optimization approach, enabling us to identify candidate waveguide configurations within an extremely large design space. By incorporating voids within an otherwise uniform substrate, the optimized waveguides are able to precisely manipulate wave propagation paths, triggering desirable interferences of the scattered wavefield that culminate in energy localization at readouts corresponding to a given logic function. An experimental setup is used to demonstrate the efficacy of such logic gates and their resilience to non-uniform loading. By implementing these building blocks into a mechanical adder, we demonstrate the scalable deployment of more sophisticated mechanical computing circuits, opening up new avenues in mechanical signal processing and physical computing.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Material Classification via Reference-Free Terahertz Spectroscopy: Revisiting Spectral Referencing and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how feature selection algorithms can enable accurate, reference-free classification of materials using sparse-frequency terahertz (THz) reflection spectroscopy. Three classes of feature selection strategies are evaluated. Namely, the filter-based mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), the embedded LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and the wrapper-based SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithms. Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Na\"ive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts. These findings highlights that reducing spectral dimensionality through data-driven selection eliminates the need for broadband sources and reference measurements, enabling compact, application-specific THz sensors. This approach offers robust material identification in real-world scenarios such as security screening, non-destructive testing, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>A silicon-based device for dynamic control of thermal emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of thermal emission is important in a number of applications from thermal energy harvesting and management and sensing of gas and chemical to thermal camouflage. Semiconductor-based devices can be engineered to enable electrical control of thermal emission, offering high modulation speed and ease of voltage control. Existing device designs for modulating thermal emission rely on semiconductors other than silicon, such as III-V and II-VI compounds, which are expensive. The silicon platform offers several advantages, including significantly lower cost, CMOS compatibility, and mature fabrication processes. However, a silicon-based design for modulating thermal emission remains absent. Here, we present an all-silicon device utilising electrical control over carrier dynamics to modulate a narrowband thermal emission in the mid-infrared region. We design a silicon device exhibiting voltage-controlled narrowband thermal emission at 10 {\mu}m and confirm its performance using electromagnetic calculations. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost, and integrated thermal emission devices made possible by the silicon platform.</description>

      <title>Robotic chip-scale nanofabrication for superior consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the rigid, high-volume automation found in industry, academic research requires process flexibility that has historically relied on variable manual operations. This hinders the fabrication of advanced, complex devices. We propose to address this gap by automating these low-volume, high-stakes tasks using a robotic arm to improve process control and consistency. As a proof of concept, we deploy this system for the resist development of Josephson junction devices. A statistical comparison of the process repeatability shows the robotic process achieves a resistance spread across chips close to 2%, a significant improvement over the ~7% spread observed from human operators, validating robotics as a solution to eliminate operator-dependent variability and a path towards industrial-level consistency in a research setting.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Dispersion and Low-Frequency Plasmons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Appraising the absolute limits of nanotubes and nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.</description>

      <title>Tuning Breakdown-to-Coercive Field Ratio in Ultra-Thin Al1-xScxN Films via Reactive Nitrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Al1-xScxN has attracted significant interest due to its large remnant polarization and low processing temperature when compared to other ferroelectric material systems. However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Framework for Glassy Polymer Viscoelasticity Across 20 Frequency Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy polymers are central to engineering applications, yet their viscoelastic response over broad frequency and temperature ranges remains difficult to characterize. We extend non-affine deformation theory by incorporating a time-dependent memory kernel within the Generalized Langevin Equation for atomistic non-affine motions, yielding frequency-dependent mechanical response. Applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the method captures the shear modulus and relaxation spectrum across more than twenty decades in frequency, from hundreds of terahertz down to the millihertz regime, thus bridging polymer mechanics from ordinary to extreme scales. Our predictions show quantitative consistency with independent estimates from oscillatory-shear molecular dynamics, Brillouin scattering, ultrasonic spectroscopy, Split-Hopkinson testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), demonstrating a unified theoretical-computational route for multiscale characterization of polymer glasses.</description>

      <title>Detecting Linear Dichroism with Atomic Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray linear dichroism has been pivotal for probing electronic anisotropies, but its inherent limited spatial resolution precludes atomic-scale investigations of orbital polarization. Here we introduce a versatile electron linear dichroism methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy that overcomes these constraints. By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy with an atomic-sized probe, we directly visualize orbital occupation at individual atomic columns in real space. Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2. These results validate our approach against established X-ray measurements while achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity. We further demonstrate two optimized signal extraction protocols that adapt to experimental constraints without compromising sensitivity. This generalizable platform opens unprecedented opportunities to study symmetry-breaking phenomena at individual defects, interfaces, and in quantum materials where atomic-scale electronic anisotropy governs emergent functionality.</description>

      <title>Revealing Modeshape Complexity and Sensitivity in Torsional Vibrations of Microcantilevers with Overhang- and T-shaped Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The torsional vibration of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers is critical for high-sensitivity measurements, yet existing models for width-varying cantilevers often rely on approximations that lead to significant discrepancies with experimental data. Unlike prior studies, this work introduces a refined analytical framework to precisely compute resonance frequencies and mode shapes, including higher-order modes, for overhang- and T-shaped microcantilevers, validated through targeted experimental comparisons. By systematically analyzing the effects of overhang length, we reveal previously unreported multi-maxima mode shapes and demonstrate how geometric tuning can controllably shift resonant frequencies. Furthermore, we establish a quantitative relationship between modal sensitivity and cantilever-surface coupling strength, providing actionable design principles for optimizing AFM cantilever performance. Our results not only reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations but also offer practical guidelines for tailoring cantilever geometry to achieve specific frequency responses in applications such as nanomechanical imaging and surface property mapping. This work advances the design of next-generation AFM probes by bridging the gap between analytical models and real-world operational demands.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Key Design Factors for Thermal Comfort in Underground Space Through Global Sensitivity Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature conditions (outdoor Tmax = 42.9 C) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024. Daytime measurements indicated reduced air temperature (AT), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and wind speed (V), together with elevated relative humidity (RH) in the underground space. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) in the underground was consistently lower during peak hours (08:00-16:00), with the maximum difference in PET between pedestrian and underground levels being 11-11.9 C. Higher pedestrian-level PET at L1 was attributed to reduced greenery and shading, and decrement factors indicated greater thermal dampening at L2 (0.197) than at L1 (0.308). Sensitivity analysis showed that MRT was the most influential factor (S1/ST = 0.59-0.72) for aboveground spaces, followed by AT (0.13-0.26). In contrast, underground PET was mainly affected by metabolic rate (MET) (0.63-0.65), followed by RH (0.14-0.20) and V (0.08-0.18). Partial dependence analysis revealed that a 1 met increase in MET raised PET by 1.6 C, whereas a 1 m/s increase in V reduced PET by 1.5-2.2 C in the underground space. Due to cooler and more stable thermal conditions, underground spaces have higher tolerance for intensive physical activities. By buffering fluctuations in AT and MRT, underground environments can significantly alleviate heat stress and provide passive cooling shelter during daytime heat waves. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence to support underground space design in hot-humid climates and offers insights for sustainable urban heat mitigation.</description>

      <title>Kramers' escape problem for white noise driven switching in ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simulation-based study of stochastic resonance (SR) in a ferroelectric capacitor is presented. The SR phenomenon involves the detection of weak signals by adding an optimal amount noise to a non-linear system. This is linked with Kramers' escape problem, which deals with the escape of a particle undergoing Brownian motion over an energy barrier. The position of the particle is analogous to the polarisation dynamics of a ferroelectric. Within this framework, we numerically investigate SR in single domain ferroelectrics using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. In addition, we use a model for multidomain ferroelectrics to demonstrate feasibility in real world applications. Our results show that SR in ferroelectrics is promising for the purpose of weak signal detection, given that these materials are widely used for various applications in the semiconductor industry.</description>

      <title>In situ 2D visualization of hydrogen entry into Zn-coated steels in NaCl solutions: Roles of Zn dissolution and potential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.</description>

      <title>1T'-MoTe$_2$ as an integrated saturable absorber for photonic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the saturable absorption behavior of a 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer integrated with a silicon nitride waveguide for applications in photonic neural networks. Using experimental transmission measurements and theoretical modeling, we characterize the nonlinear response of the material. Our model, incorporating quasi-Fermi level separation and carrier dynamics, successfully explains these behaviors and predicts the material's absorption dependence on the carrier density. Furthermore, we demonstrate a coupling efficiency of up to 20% between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer and the silicon nitride waveguide, with saturation achievable at input powers as low as a few uW. These results suggest that 1T'-MoTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for implementing nonlinear functions in integrated photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>NeOTF: Guidestar-free neural representation for broadband dynamic imaging through scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media is ubiquitous in real-world settings, yet it remains a defining unsolved problem as rapid spatiotemporal fluctuations overwhelm standard reconstruction pipelines that often rely on speckles with high signal-to-noise ratio. Existing approaches fall into two categories. Guidestar-based methods employ a guidestar to recover the system transfer function; however, in dynamic media, the speckle decorrelates rapidly, making the calibration quickly invalid. Guidestar-free methods infer information from speckle statistics, but rapid changes and noise often break phase retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NeOTF, a guidestar-free and neural-representation-based OTF retrieval method that enables dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media. By optimizing this neural representation with only a few speckle images from unknown objects, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF without a guidestar. We experimentally demonstrate robust dynamic imaging through scattering with NeOTF at extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and broadband incoherent illumination (up to 300 nm spectral bandwidth) scenarios, and we numerically validate its dynamic imaging performance in time-varying scattering media leveraging spatio-temporal memory effect. Finally, we discuss and analyze its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities across anisotropic scattering media. These results establish NeOTF's promise as a practical and robust solution for dynamic imaging through scattering media.

      <title>Mie-tronics supermodes and symmetry breaking in nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is usually believed that symmetry breaking in photonic systems leads to weaker optical confinement, such as in the case of metasurfaces when bound states in the continuum are replaced by quasi-bound states with lower quality factors (Q factors). Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>
