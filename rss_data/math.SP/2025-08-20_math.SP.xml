      <title>Hot spots in domains of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove constant-curvature analogues of several results regarding the hot spots conjecture in dimension two. Our main theorem shows that the hot spots conjecture holds for all non-acute geodesic triangles of constant negative curvature. We also prove that, under certain circumstances, on constant (positive or negative) curvature triangles, first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann Laplace eigenfunctions have no non-vertex critical points. Moreover, we show that each of these eigenfunctions is monotonic with respect to some Killing field. Finally, we show that for general simply connected polygons of non-zero constant curvature--with exactly one family of exceptions--second Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian have at most finitely many critical points.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of simple eigenvalues of particle-in-well systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle in a well in dimension one is a classical problem in quantum mechanics. We study higher-dimensional analogues of the problem, where the well is a smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that simple eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator depend smoothly on the square root $h$ of the inverse depth of the well and provide an explicit first-order expansion of the eigenvalues at $h = 0$.
  Our proof consists of two steps. In the first step, we construct $\mathcal{O}(h^\infty)$ quasimodes (approximate eigenfunctions) on a resolution of $[0, 1)_h\times\mathbb{R}^d$ which allows us to capture fine structure near the boundary of the well. The second step corrects these quasimodes to true eigenfunctions via a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral properties of electromagnetic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a reference homogeneous and isotropic electromagnetic waveguide with a simply connected cross-section embedded in a perfect conductor. In this setting, when the waveguide is straight, the spectrum of the associated self-adjoint Maxwell operator with a constant twist (which may be zero) lies on the real line and is symmetric with respect to zero and exhibits a spectral gap around the origin. Moreover, the spectrum is purely essential, and contains 0 which is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. In this work, we present new results on the effects of geometric deformations, specifically bending and twisting, on the spectrum of the Maxwell operator. More precisely, we provide, on the one hand, sufficient conditions on the asymptotic behavior of curvature and twist that ensure the preservation of the essential spectrum of the reference waveguide. Our approach relies on a Birman-Schwinger-type principle, which may be of independent interest and applicable in other contexts. On the other hand, we give sufficient conditions (involving in particular the geometrical shape of the cross-section of the waveguide) so that the geometrical deformation creates discrete spectrum (namely isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity) within the gap of the essential spectrum. In addition, we give some results on the localization of these discrete eigenvalues. The sufficient condition involving the cross-section is then studied both analytically and numerically. Finally, we examine its stability under shape deformations of the cross-section, focusing in particular on the case of a waveguide with a rectangular cross-section.</description>

      <title>Theory and internal structure of ADER-DG method for ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of the approximation properties, convergence, and stability of the ADER-DG method for solving an ODE system is carried out. The ADER-DG method generates a new implicit RK method, which is similar in its properties to the original ADER-DG method. The ADER-DG method has an approximation order $2N+1$ when using polynomials of degree $N$ for the numerical solution at grid nodes, and demonstrates superconvergence. The local solution obtained by the local DG predictor has an approximation order $N+1$ and has a subgrid resolution. The ADER-DG method is $A$- and $AN$-stable, $L$-stable, $B$- and $BN$-stable, and algebraically stable. Applications of the ADER-DG method demonstrated compliance with the expected theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Self-composition of Frobenius a real number of times, and some conjectures around Weil's Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$.
  What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture, for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures almost follow from the Standard conjectures.
  All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>
