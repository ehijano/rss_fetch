      <title>Interval reduced-order switched positive observers for uncertain switched positive linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order switched positive observers for continuous- and discrete-time switched positive linear systems with uncertainty are established. In the analyzed class, arbitrary switching is permitted, whereas the uncertainty expressed via matrix inequalities concerns both the initial state and system parameters. Positive lower and positive upper interval switched observers are obtained. The proposed observers are of (n - p) order, where n is the dimension of the state vector and p is the rank of the output matrix, i.e., p-dimensional measurement information. Moreover, as a special case, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order positive observers for uncertain positive linear systems without switching are provided. The theoretical findings are illustrated by two numerical examples for continuous- and discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Direct Data Driven Control Using Noisy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel direct data-driven control framework for solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) under disturbances and noisy state measurements. The system dynamics are assumed unknown, and the LQR solution is learned using only a single trajectory of noisy input-output data while bypassing system identification. Our approach guarantees mean-square stability (MSS) and optimal performance by leveraging convex optimization techniques that incorporate noise statistics directly into the controller synthesis. First, we establish a theoretical result showing that the MSS of an uncertain data-driven system implies the MSS of the true closed-loop system. Building on this, we develop a robust stability condition using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that yields a stabilizing controller gain from noisy measurements. Finally, we formulate a data-driven LQR problem as a semidefinite program (SDP) that computes an optimal gain, minimizing the steady-state covariance. Extensive simulations on benchmark systems -- including a rotary inverted pendulum and an active suspension system -- demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of our method compared to existing data-driven LQR approaches. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for controller design in noise-corrupted environments where system identification is infeasible.</description>

      <title>Development of Reduced Feeder and Load Models Using Practical Topological and Loading Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution feeder and load model reduction methods are essential for maintaining a good tradeoff between accurate representation of grid behavior and reduced computational complexity in power system studies. An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper. Simulations conducted in this work show that the reduced feeder and load model of a utility feeder, obtained using the proposed method, can accurately capture contactor and motor stalling behaviors for critical events such as fault induced delayed voltage recovery.</description>

      <title>Handling Pedestrian Uncertainty in Coordinating Autonomous Vehicles at Signal-Free Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework for the coordination of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections, accounting for the unexpected presence of pedestrians. First, we introduce a general vehicle-to-infrastructure communication protocol and a low-level controller that determines the optimal unconstrained trajectories for CAVs, in terms of fuel efficiency and travel time, to cross the intersection without considering pedestrians. If such an unconstrained trajectory is unattainable, we introduce sufficient certificates for each CAV to cross the intersection while respecting the associated constraints. Next, we consider the case where an unexpected pedestrian enters the road. When the CAV's sensors detect a pedestrian, an emergency mode is activated, which imposes certificates related to an unsafe set in the pedestrian's proximity area. Simultaneously, a re-planning mechanism is implemented for all CAVs to accommodate the trajectories of vehicles operating in emergency mode. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach through simulations conducted in MATLAB and RoadRunner softwares, which facilitate the integration of sensor tools and the realization of real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameterization of Hybrid Physics-Based and Machine Learning Li-Ion Battery Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical hybrid battery models have major potential to enable advanced physics-based control, diagnostic, and prognostic features for next-generation lithium-ion battery management systems. This is due to the physical significance of the electrochemical model, which is complemented by a machine learning model that compensates for output prediction errors caused by system uncertainties. While hybrid models have demonstrated robust output prediction performance under large system uncertainties, they are highly susceptible to the influence of uncertainties during parameter identification, which can compromise the physical significance of the model. To address this challenge, we present a parameter estimation framework that explicitly considers system uncertainties through a discrepancy function. The approach also incorporates a downsampling procedure to address the computational barriers associated with large time-series data sets, as are typical in the battery domain. The framework was validated in simulation, yielding several mean parameter estimation errors that were one order of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional least squares approach. While developed for the high-uncertainty, electrochemical hybrid modeling context, the estimation framework is applicable to all models and is presented in a generalized form.</description>

      <title>Mixer-Informer-Based Two-Stage Transfer Learning for Long-Sequence Load Forecasting in Newly Constructed Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption demands precise charging station load forecasting, challenged by long-sequence temporal dependencies and limited data in new facilities. This study proposes MIK-TST, a novel two-stage transfer learning framework integrating Mixer, Informer, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The Mixer fuses multi-source features, Informer captures long-range dependencies via ProbSparse attention, and KAN enhances nonlinear modeling with learnable activation functions. Pre-trained on extensive data and fine-tuned on limited target data, MIK-TST achieves 4% and 8% reductions in MAE and MSE, respectively, outperforming baselines on a dataset of 26 charging stations in Boulder, USA. This scalable solution enhances smart grid efficiency and supports sustainable EV infrastructure expansion.</description>

      <title>A Novel Inverter Control Strategy with Power Decoupling for Microgrid Operations in Grid-Connected and Islanded Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming, particularly those utilizing droop control and virtual synchronous generators (VSG), can actively regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrid systems, exhibiting dynamic characteristics akin to those of synchronous generators. Although droop control and VSG control each have distinct benefits, neither can fully meet the diverse, dynamic needs of both grid-connected (GC) and islanded (IS) modes. Additionally, the coupling between active and reactive power can negatively impact microgrids' dynamic performance and stability. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a unified dynamic power coupling (UDC) model. This model's active power control loop can be tailored to meet diverse requirements. By implementing a well-designed control loop, the system can harness the advantages of both droop control and VSG control. In islanded mode, the proposed model can provide virtual inertia and damping properties, while in grid-connected mode, the inverter's active power output can follow the changed references without significant overshoot or oscillation. Furthermore, the model incorporates coupling compensation and virtual impedance based on a relative gain array in the frequency domain to facilitate quantitative analysis of power coupling characteristics. This paper outlines a distinct design process for the unified model. Finally, the proposed control method has been validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>AI-CDA4All: Democratizing Cooperative Autonomous Driving for All Drivers via Affordable Dash-cam Hardware and Open-source AI Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transportation technology advances, the demand for connected vehicle infrastructure has greatly increased to improve their efficiency and safety. One area of advancement, Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) still relies on expensive autonomy sensors or connectivity units and are not interoperable across existing market car makes/models, limiting its scalability on public roads. To fill these gaps, this paper presents a novel approach to democratizing CDA technology, it leverages low-cost, commercially available edge devices such as vehicle dash-cams and open-source software to make the technology accessible and scalable to be used in transportation infrastructure and broader public domains. This study also investigates the feasibility of utilizing cost-effective communication protocols based on LTE and WiFi. These technologies enable lightweight Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, facilitating real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. Our research and development efforts are aligned with industrial standards to ensure compatibility and future integration into existing transportation ecosystems. By prioritizing infrastructure-oriented applications, such as improved traffic flow management, this approach seeks to deliver tangible societal benefits without directly competing with vehicle OEMs. As recent advancement of Generative AI (GenAI), there is no standardized integration of GenAI technologies into open-source CDAs, as the current trends of muiltimodal large language models gain popularity, we demonstrated a feasible locally deployed edge LLM models can enhance driving experience while preserving privacy and security compared to cloud-connected solutions. The proposed system underscores the potential of low-cost, scalable solutions in advancing CDA functionality, paving the way for smarter, safer, and more inclusive transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions With Real-Time Gaussian Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for satisfying state constraints in systems with nonparametric uncertainty by estimating this uncertainty with a real-time-update Gaussian process (GP) model. Notably, new data is incorporated into the model in real time as it is obtained and select old data is removed from the model. This update process helps improve the model estimate while keeping the model size (memory required) and computational complexity fixed. We present a recursive formulation for the model update, which reduces time complexity of the update from O(p3) to O(p2), where p is the number of data used. The GP model includes a computable upper bound on the model error. Together, the model and upper bound are used to construct a control-barrier-function (CBF) constraint that guarantees state constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Secure Safety Filter Design for Sampled-data Nonlinear Systems under Sensor Spoofing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a secure safety filter design for nonlinear systems under sensor spoofing attacks. Existing approaches primarily focus on linear systems which limits their applications in real-world scenarios. In this work, we extend these results to nonlinear systems in a principled way. We introduce exact observability maps that abstract specific state estimation algorithms and extend them to a secure version capable of handling sensor attacks. Our generalization also applies to the relaxed observability case, with slightly relaxed guarantees. More importantly, we propose a secure safety filter design in both exact and relaxed cases, which incorporates secure state estimation and a control barrier function-enabled safety filter. The proposed approach provides theoretical safety guarantees for nonlinear systems in the presence of sensor attacks. We numerically validate our analysis on a unicycle vehicle equipped with redundant yet partly compromised sensors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Leaderless UAV Formation Flying with Collision Avoidance under Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the leaderless formation flying problem with collision avoidance for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which requires the UAVs to navigate through cluttered environments without colliding while maintaining the formation. The communication network among the UAVs is structured as a directed graph that includes a directed spanning tree. A novel distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method based on the model reference adaptive consensus (MRACon) framework is proposed. Within this framework, each UAV tracks an assigned reference output generated by a linear reference model that utilizes relative measurements as input. Subsequently, the NMPC method penalizes the tracking error between the output of the reference model and that of the actual model while also establishing constraint sets for collision avoidance and physical limitations to achieve distributed and safe formation control. Finally, simulations and hardware experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Time-Modulated EM Skins for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative solution, based on the exploitation of the harmonic beams generated by time-modulated electromagnetic skins (TM-EMSs), is proposed for the implementation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionalities in a Smart Electromagnetic Environment (SEME) scenario. More in detail, the field radiated by a user terminal, located at an unknown position, is assumed to illuminate a passive TM-EMS that, thanks to a suitable modulation of the local reflection coefficients at the meta-atom level of the EMS surface, simultaneously reflects towards a receiving base station (BS) a "sum" beam and a "difference" one at slightly different frequencies. By processing the received signals and exploiting monopulse radar tracking concepts, the BS both localizes the user terminal and, as a by-product, establishes a communication link with it by leveraging on the "sum" reflected beam. Towards this purpose, the arising harmonic beam control problem is reformulated as a global optimization one, which is successively solved by means of an evolutionary iterative approach to determine the desired TM-EMS modulation sequence. The results from selected numerical and experimental tests are reported to assess the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Current Control Strategy for Reliable Power Electronics Converters: Frequency-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition for power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert electrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The semiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most likely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced temperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and employed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the lifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models can offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the converter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the temperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated damage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability requirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of the semiconductor damage.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of Uncertain Switched Affine Systems via Scenario Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switched affine systems are often used to model and control complex dynamical systems that operate in multiple modes. However, uncertainties in the system matrices can challenge their stability and performance. This paper introduces a new approach for designing switching control laws for uncertain switched affine systems using data-driven scenario optimization. Instead of relaxing invariant sets, our method creates smaller invariant sets with quadratic Lyapunov functions through scenario-based optimization, effectively reducing chattering effects and regulation error. The framework ensures robustness against parameter uncertainties while improving accuracy. We validate our method with applications in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes and power electronic converters, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stealth Attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized stealth attack constructions that minimize the mutual information between the state variables and the measurements are proposed. The attack constructions are formulated as random Gaussian attacks targeting Cyber-physical systems that aims at minimizing the mutual information between the state variables and measurements while constraining the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the measurements under attacks and the distribution of the measurements without attacks. The proposed information metrics adopted measure the disruption and attack detection both globally and locally. The decentralized attack constructions are formulated in a framework of normal games. The global and local information metrics yield games with global and local objectives in disruption and attack detection. We have proven the games are potential games and the convexity of the potential functions followed by the uniqueness and the achievability of the Nash Equilibrium, accordingly. We proposed a best response dynamics to achieve the Nash Equilibrium of the games. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed decentralized stealth random attacks on IEEE test systems and show it is feasible to exploit game theoretic techniques in decentralized attack constructions.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Test of Datatic Approximate Optimal Filter in Nonlinear Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtering is crucial in engineering fields, providing vital state estimation for control systems. However, the nonlinear nature of complex systems and the presence of non-Gaussian noises pose significant challenges to the performance of conventional filtering methods in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a data-driven closed-loop filter, termed datatic approximate optimal filter (DAOF), specifically designed for nonlinear systems under non-Gaussian conditions. We first formulate a Markovian filtering problem (MFP), which inherently shares a connection with reinforcement learning (RL) as it aims to compute the optimal state estimate by minimizing the accumulated error. To solve MFP, we propose DAOF, which primarily incorporates a trained RL policy and features two distinct structural designs: DAOF-v1 and DAOF-v2. Designed for systems with explicit models, DAOF-v1 combines prediction and update phases, with the RL policy generating the update value. Meanwhile, DAOF-v2 bypasses system modeling by directly outputting the state estimate. Then, we utilize an actor-critic algorithm to learn the parameterized policy for DAOF. Experimental results on a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle system, equipped with explicit system models, demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of DAOF-v1 compared to existing nonlinear filters. Moreover, DAOF-v2 showcases its unique ability to perform filtering without requiring explicit system modeling, as validated by a 14-DOF vehicle system.</description>

      <title>YANNs: Y-wise Affine Neural Networks for Exact and Efficient Representations of Piecewise Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a fully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently represent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from the proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to achieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all mathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model predictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which theoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of states, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of multi-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic guarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart from the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal control laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference speed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time compared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect to the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a significant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller that inherently ensures both feasibility and stability. Future applications can leverage them as an efficient and interpretable starting point for data-driven modeling/control.</description>

      <title>OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.</description>

      <title>Economic data-enabled predictive control using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a convex data-based economic predictive control method within the framework of data-enabled predictive control (DeePC). Specifically, we use a neural network to transform the system output into a new state space, where the nonlinear economic cost function of the underlying nonlinear system is approximated using a quadratic function expressed by the transformed output in the new state space. Both the neural network parameters and the coefficients of the quadratic function are learned from open-loop data of the system. Additionally, we reconstruct constrained output variables from the transformed output through learning an output reconstruction matrix; this way, the proposed economic DeePC can handle output constraints explicitly. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated via a case study in a simulated chemical process.</description>

      <title>A Novel Online Pseudospectral Method for Approximation of Nonlinear Systems Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel online system identification approach utilizing the Chebyshev pseudospectral (PS) method to approximate the dynamics of a continuous-time nonlinear system. Unlike conventional periodic sampling, the proposed identification scheme employs aperiodic state sampling, leveraging the Chebyshev nodes to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. Unlike traditional off-line PS approaches, the scheme utilizes a moving time-window strategy to compute the sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) forward in time for state measurements. Within each time window, the number of sampling instants is adaptively determined to meet the specified approximation accuracy. The Chebyshev basis is also shifted for each time window to accommodate arbitrary approximation intervals. The least-squares approach is employed to estimate the coefficients of the shifted Chebyshev basis functions using the measured state and its derivatives at the end of each window, resulting in a piecewise approximation of the drift dynamics of the system. In the second step, the identified drift dynamics are utilized to design an adaptive state estimator to reconstruct the continuous system states from the aperiodic state measurements. To address the smoothness of the piecewise approximated system dynamics, the Chebyshev coefficients are recomputed at the window transition instants, between two consecutive time windows, by enforcing continuity of the approximated function and its derivatives. In addition, analytical results are provided to determine the number of sampling instants within each time window, which guarantees the desired approximation accuracy. The boundedness of function approximation and state estimation errors is also proved analytically. Finally, numerical simulation results are included to validate the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Control Synthesis for Multiple Quadrotors under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring continuous-time control of multiple quadrotors in constrained environments under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, safety constraints, and disturbances. This letter proposes a two-stage framework to address this challenge. First, exponentially decaying tracking error bounds are derived with multidimensional geometric control gains obtained via differential evolution. These bounds are less conservative, while the resulting tracking errors exhibit smaller oscillations and improved transient performance. Second, leveraging the time-varying bounds, a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) formulation generates piecewise B\'ezier reference trajectories that satisfy STL and velocity limits, while ensuring inter-agent safety through convex-hull properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables formally verifiable multi-agent coordination in constrained environments, with provable tracking guarantees under bounded disturbances.</description>

      <title>High Performance Signal Design for ACO-OFDM Systems using Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low symbol error rate (SER), and high data rate signal for asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) systems. The proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Energy personas in Danish households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technologies to monitor the provision of renewable energy are part of emerging technologies to help address the discrepancy between renewable energy production and its related usage in households. This paper presents various ways householders use a technological artifact for the real-time monitoring of renewable energy provision. Such a monitoring thus affords householders with an opportunity to adjust their energy consumption according to renewable energy provision. In Denmark, Ewii, previously Barry, is a Danish energy supplier which provides householders with an opportunity to monitor energy sources in real time through a technological solution of the same name. This paper use provision afforded by Ewii as a case for exploring how householders organize themselves to use a technological artefact that supports the monitoring of energy and its related usage. This study aims to inform technology design through the derivation of four personas. The derived personas highlight the differences in energy monitoring practices for the householders and their engagement. These personas are characterised as dedicated, organised, sporadic, and convenient. Understanding these differences in energy monitoring practice using the technological artefact form a solid element in the design of future energy technologies that interfere with the everyday practices and energy consumption for households. This is paramount for future energy related technology design, and for the clarification of usage assumptions that are embedded in the rollout of energy related technology as a country such as Denmark moves through its green transition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low Emission Zones scheduling as an example of transport policy backcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a backcasting approach that considers the passenger car fleet dynamics to determine optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. As opposed to the scenario-based approach, backcasting sets emission reduction targets first, then identifies policies that meet the constraint. The policy is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs), in the Ile-de-France region as a case study. The aim is to minimize the number of scrapped vehicles due to LEZs under CO2 emission targets and to deduce an interdiction schedule of polluting vehicles by 2050. To explore potential solutions, we use a genetic algorithm that provides a first insight into optimal policy pathways.</description>

      <title>Integrated Localization and Path Planning for an Ocean Exploring Team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Consensus Graph Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordinated by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is efficient and reliable for deep ocean exploration. AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming. Numerical simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample-Based Reachability for Safe Control with Gaussian Process Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies across diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or are overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this gap, we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model's epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sample complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building on this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible and guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples, highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Industrial Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly demands energy-efficient control strategies to balance performance with environmental and cost constraints. In this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption. Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and 0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach from simulation to real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Non-Conservative Data-driven Safe Control Design for Nonlinear Systems with Polyhedral Safe Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven nonlinear safe control design approach for discrete-time systems under parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances. We first characterize a new control structure from which a data-based representation of closed-loop systems is obtained. This data-based closed-loop system is composed of two parts: 1) a parametrized linear closed-loop part and a parametrized nonlinear remainder closed-loop part. We show that using the standard practice or learning a robust controller to ensure safety while treating the remaining nonlinearities as disturbances brings about significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and conservatism. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel nonlinear safe control design approach in which the closed-loop nonlinear remainders are learned, rather than canceled, in a control-oriented fashion while preserving the computational efficiency. To this end, a primal-dual optimization framework is leveraged in which the control gains are learned to enforce the second-order optimality on the closed-loop nonlinear remainders. This allows us to account for nonlinearities in the design for the sake of safety rather than treating them as disturbances. This new controller parameterization and design approach reduces the computational complexity and the conservatism of designing a safe nonlinear controller. A simulation example is then provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven controller.</description>

      <title>Extended Convex Hull-Based Distributed Optimal Energy Flow of Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10338v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated electricity and gas systems are constructed to facilitate the gas-fired generation, and the distributed operation of these integrated systems have received much attention due to the increased emphasis on data security and privacy between different agencies. This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hullbased constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.</description>

      <title>Engineering Risk-Aware, Security-by-Design Frameworks for Assurance of Large-Scale Autonomous AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vision-Based Magnetic Microrobotic Pushing of Micro-Objects and Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and autonomous transportation of micro-objects and biological cells can enable significant advances in a wide variety of research disciplines. Here, we present a novel, vision-based, model-free microrobotic pushing algorithm for the autonomous manipulation of micro objects and biological cells. The algorithm adjusts the axis of a rotating magnetic field that in turn controls the heading angle and spin axis of a spherical Janus rolling microrobot. We introduce the concept of a microrobotic guiding corridor to constrain the object and to avoid pushing failures. We then show that employing only two simple conditions, the microrobot is able to successfully and autonomously push microscale objects along predefined trajectories. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by measuring the mean absolute error and completion time relative to a desired path at different actuation frequencies and guiding corridor widths. Finally, we demonstrate biomedical applicability by autonomously transporting a single biological cell, highlighting the methods potential for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and synthetic biology.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Lagrange Multipliers in Distribution Network Reconfiguration Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) is an effective approach for optimizing distribution network operation. However, the DNR problem is computationally challenging due to the mixed-integer non-convex nature. One feasible approach for addressing this challenge is to reformulate binary line on/off state variables as (continuous) non-convex constraints, leading to a nonconvex program. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether this formulation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions at locally optimal solutions. In this brief, we study the existence of Lagrange multipliers in DNR problems and prove that under mild assumptions, Lagrange multipliers exist for the DNR model at every locally optimal solution almost surely such that the KKT conditions hold.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multi-View Fidelity in Autonomous UAV Swarm Sport Injury Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, real-time collision detection is essential for ensuring player safety and effective refereeing in high-contact sports such as rugby, particularly given the severe risks associated with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Traditional collision-monitoring methods employing fixed cameras or wearable sensors face limitations in visibility, coverage, and responsiveness. Previously, we introduced a framework using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring and real time kinematics extraction from videos of collision events. In this paper, we show that the strategies operating on the objective of ensuring at least one UAV captures every incident on the pitch have an emergent property of fulfilling a stronger key condition for successful kinematics extraction. Namely, they ensure that almost all collisions are captured by multiple drones, establishing multi-view fidelity and redundancy, while not requiring any drone-to-drone communication.</description>

      <title>Dynamic feedback linearization of two-input control systems via successive one-fold prolongations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a constructive algorithm to dynamically linearize two-input control systems via successive one-fold prolongations of a control that has to be suitably chosen at each step of the algorithm. Linearization via successive one-fold prolongations requires special properties of the linearizability distributions $\mathcal{D}^0 \subset \mathcal{D}^1 \subset\mathcal{D}^2 \subset \cdots$. Contrary to the case of static feedback linearizability, they need not be involutive but the first noninvolutive one has to contain an involutive subdistribution of corank one. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to replace, at each step, the first noninvolutive distribution by its involutive subdistribution of corank one, thus for the prolonged system we gain at least one new involutive distribution. Our algorithm is constructive, gives sufficient conditions for flatness, and can be seen as the dual of the dynamic feedback linearization algorithm of Battilotti and Califano [2003, 2005].</description>

      <title>A Survey on Data-Driven Modeling of Human Drivers' Lane-Changing Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver, significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments, often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as the integration and improvement of technical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Event-Triggered Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose locally convergent Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for $N$-player noncooperative games, which use distributed event-triggered pseudo-gradient estimates. The proposed approach employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the pseudo-gradients of unknown quadratic payoff functions. This is the first instance of noncooperative games being tackled in a model-free fashion with event-triggered extremum seeking. Each player evaluates independently the deviation between the corresponding current pseudo-gradient estimate and its last broadcasted value from the event-triggering mechanism to tune individually the player action, while they preserve collectively the closed-loop stability/convergence. We guarantee Zeno behavior avoidance by establishing a minimum dwell-time to avoid infinitely fast switching. In particular, the stability analysis is carried out using Lyapunov's method and averaging for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. We quantify the size of the ultimate small residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and illustrate the theoretical results numerically on an oligopoly setting.</description>

      <title>Improving 5G/B5G Network Performance with RFID-Enabled Resource Management Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G and B5G (beyond 5G) networks, efficient resource optimization is critical to addressing the escalating demands for high-speed, low-latency, and energy efficient communication. This study explores the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology as a novel approach to enhance resource management in 5G/B5G networks. The motivation behind this research lies in overcoming persistent challenges such as spectrum congestion, high latency, and inefficient load balancing, which impede the performance of traditional resource allocation methods. To achieve this, RFID tags were embedded in critical network components, including user devices, base stations, and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling the collection of real-time data on device status, location, and resource utilization. RFID readers strategically placed across the network continuously captured this data, which was processed by a centralized controller using a custom-designed optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically managed key network resources, including spectrum allocation, load balancing, and energy consumption, ensuring efficient operation under varying network conditions. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the RFID-based model against traditional 4G dynamic resource allocation techniques. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Digital-physical testbed for ship autonomy studies in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory basin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and often researchers lack availability to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving to semi-fullscale validation with the R/V milliAmpere 1 passenger ferry and full-scale validation using the R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) including autonomy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Safety in Complex Environments: Synthesizing Safety Filters with Poisson's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing safe sets for robotic systems operating in complex and dynamically changing environments is a challenging problem. Solving this problem can enable the construction of safety filters that guarantee safe control actions -- most notably by employing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). This paper presents an algorithm for generating safe sets from perception data by leveraging elliptic partial differential equations, specifically Poisson's equation. Given a local occupancy map, we solve Poisson's equation subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, with a novel forcing function. Specifically, we design a smooth guidance vector field, which encodes gradient information required for safety. The result is a variational problem for which the unique minimizer -- a safety function -- characterizes the safe set. After establishing our theoretical result, we illustrate how safety functions can be used in CBF-based safety filtering. The real-time utility of our synthesis method is highlighted through hardware demonstrations on quadruped and humanoid robots navigating dynamically changing obstacle-filled environments.</description>

      <title>Secure Safety Filter: Towards Safe Flight Control under Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern autopilot systems are prone to sensor attacks that can jeopardize flight safety. To mitigate this risk, we proposed a modular solution: the secure safety filter, which extends the well-established control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter to account for, and mitigate, sensor attacks. This module consists of a secure state reconstructor (which generates plausible states) and a safety filter (which computes the safe control input that is closest to the nominal one). Differing from existing work focusing on linear, noise-free systems, the proposed secure safety filter handles bounded measurement noise and, by leveraging reduced-order model techniques, is applicable to the nonlinear dynamics of drones. Software-in-the-loop simulations and drone hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the secure safety filter in rendering the system safe in the presence of sensor attacks.</description>

      <title>Realistic Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning-Controlled Mobile Robots using 2D LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating realistic counterfactual explanations (CFEs) in machine learning (ML)-based control for mobile robots using 2D LiDAR. ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Optimization of Wave-Controlled Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising type of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) employs tunable control of its varactors using biasing transmission lines below the RIS reflecting elements. Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a time-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired biasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A simple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of the BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accurately configure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors such as device non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and thus significant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performance. An alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using training data obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a set of BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map between the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. This is the approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the predicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then designed via Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio measure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN and using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting optimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings to instantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Learning Quasi-LPV Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets with Reduced Conservativeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to identify a quasi Linear Parameter Varying (qLPV) model of a plant, with the qLPV model guaranteed to admit a robust control invariant (RCI) set. It builds upon the concurrent synthesis framework presented in [1], in which the requirement of existence of an RCI set is modeled as a control-oriented regularization. Here, we reduce the conservativeness of the approach by bounding the qLPV system with an uncertain LTI system, which we derive using bound propagation approaches. The resulting regularization function is the optimal value of a nonlinear robust optimization problem that we solve via a differentiable algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over two benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>HuB: Learning Extreme Humanoid Balance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

      <title>Interpretable Event Diagnosis in Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to deal with such events.
  In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic use case using the L-Town benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, being fast and precise are key requirements in Robotics. This work introduces a novel methodology to tune the stiffness of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) while simultaneously addressing the tension distribution problem. In particular, the approach relies on the Analytic-Centre method. Indeed, weighting the barrier functions makes natural the stiffness adaptation. The intrinsic ability to adjust the stiffness during the execution of the task enables the CDPRs to effectively meet above-mentioned requirements. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through simulations by comparing it with the existing approach.</description>

      <title>Anti-windup design for internal model online constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithmic design procedure for online constrained optimization grounded in control-theoretic principles. By integrating the Internal Model Principle (IMP) with an anti-windup compensation mechanism, the proposed Projected-Internal Model Anti-Windup (P-IMAW) gradient descent exploits a partial knowledge of the temporal evolution of the cost function to enhance tracking performance. The algorithm is developed through a structured synthesis procedure: first, a robust controller leveraging the IMP ensures asymptotic convergence in the unconstrained setting. Second, an anti-windup augmentation guarantees stability and performance in the presence of the projection operator needed to satisfy the constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations comparing it against other classical techniques.</description>

      <title>Congestion-Sensitive Grid Aggregation for DC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast spatial dimension of modern interconnected electricity grids challenges the tractability of the DC optimal power flow problem. Grid aggregation methods try to overcome this challenge by reducing the number of network elements. Many existing methods use Locational Marginal Prices as a distance metric to cluster nodes. In this paper, we show that prevalent methods adopting this distance metric fail to adequately capture the impact of individual lines when there is more than one line congested. This leads to suboptimal outcomes for the optimization of the aggregated model. To overcome those issues, we propose two methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric, which preserves the impact of nodal power injections on individual line congestions. The proposed methods are compared to several existing aggregation methods based on Locational Marginal Prices. We demonstrate all methods on adapted versions of the IEEE RTS 24- and 300-Bus systems. We show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches both in terms of objective function value error and maximum line limit violation, while exhibiting faster node clustering. We conclude that aggregation methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric are better at preserving the essential physical characteristics of the network topology in the grid aggregation process than methods based on Locational Marginal Prices.</description>

      <title>DexWild: Dexterous Human Interactions for In-the-Wild Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments, but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

First, we introduce a static state estimation model and bad data detection method for IEGSs. Then, we develop FDIAs on IEGSs with complete network topology and parameter information. Next, we develop FDIAs on IEGSs when intruders have only local network topology and parameter information of an IEGS. Lastly, we explore FDIAs on IEGSs when intruders have only local network topology information of an IEGS.</description>

      <title>Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms.
  This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning.
  Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Formation Control of Non-Holonomic Multi-Robot Systems in Communication-Limited Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized estimator-based safety-critical controller designed for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots operating in communication-constrained environments. The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Our numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Power Losses and the Efficacy of Power Minimization Strategies in Multichannel Electrical Stimulation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroprosthetic devices require multichannel stimulator systems with an increasing number of channels. However, there are inherent power losses in typical multichannel stimulation circuits caused by a mismatch between the power supply voltage and the voltage required at each electrode to successfully stimulate tissue. This imposes a bottleneck towards high-channel-count devices, which is particularly severe in wirelessly-powered devices. Hence, advances in the power efficiency of stimulation systems are critical. To support these advances, this paper presents a methodology to identify and quantify power losses associated with different power supply scaling strategies in multichannel stimulation systems. The proposed methodology utilizes distributions of stimulation amplitudes and electrode impedances to calculate power losses in multichannel systems. Experimental data from previously published studies spanning various stimulation applications were analyzed to evaluate the performance of fixed, global, and stepped supply scaling methods, focusing on their impact on power dissipation and efficiency. Variability in output conditions results in low power efficiency in multichannel stimulation systems across all applications. Stepped voltage scaling demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements, achieving an increase of 67 % to 146 %, particularly in high-channel-count applications with significant variability in tissue impedance. Global scaling, by contrast, was more advantageous for systems with fewer channels. The findings highlight the importance of tailoring power management strategies to specific applications to optimize efficiency while minimizing system complexity. The proposed methodology offers a framework for evaluating efficiency-complexity trade-offs, advancing the design of scalable neurostimulation systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver control of satellite using Reinforcement learning-based Adaptive Fixed-Time Sliding Mode Controller</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite dynamics in unknown environments are inherently uncertain due to factors such as varying gravitational fields, atmospheric drag, and unpredictable interactions with space debris or other celestial bodies. Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with high accuracy and reliability under noisy conditions for applications to industrial systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with control and exogenous inputs for highly accurate and reliable prediction. The method is applied to the diesel engine airpath systems, which are known as a nonlinear complicated industrial system. Although SINDy is recognized as a remarkable approach for identifying nonlinear systems, several challenges remain. Its application to industrial systems remains limited, and multi-step predictions are not guaranteed due to overfitting and noisy data. This phenomenon is often caused by the increase in basis functions resulting from the extension of coordinates, such as time-delay embedding. To address these problems, we propose an emphasized SINDy by incorporating ensemble learning, elite gathering, and classification techniques while keeping convex calculation. The proposed method employs library bagging and extracts elites with an R-squared greater than 90%. Then, clustering is performed on the surviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always available, and the elites obtained do not always show the same trends. After the classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean of each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected. The simulation results show that the proposed method realizes multi-step prediction for the airpath system, which is known to be a complicated industrial system under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>Automated Fuzzing of Automotive Control Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are governed by a network of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are programmed to sense inputs from the driver and the environment, to process these inputs, and to control actuators that, e.g., regulate the engine or even control the steering system. ECUs within a vehicle communicate via automotive bus systems such as the Controller Area Network (CAN), and beyond the vehicles boundaries through upcoming vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure channels. Approaches to manipulate the communication between ECUs for the purpose of security testing and reverse-engineering of vehicular functions have been presented in the past, all of which struggle with automating the detection of system change in response to message injection. In this paper we present our findings with fuzzing CAN networks, in particular while observing individual ECUs with a sensor harness. The harness detects physical responses, which we then use in a oracle functions to inform the fuzzing process. We systematically define fuzzers, fuzzing configurations and oracle functions for testing ECUs. We evaluate our approach based on case studies of commercial instrument clusters and with an experimental framework for CAN authentication. Our results show that the approach is capable of identifying interesting ECU states with a high level of automation. Our approach is applicable in distributed cyber-physical systems beyond automotive computing.</description>

      <title>The Pump Scheduling Problem: A Real-World Scenario for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive results in domains such as games and robotics, where task formulations are well-defined. However, few DRL benchmarks are grounded in complex, real-world environments, where safety constraints, partial observability, and the need for hand-engineered task representations pose significant challenges. To help bridge this gap, we introduce a testbed based on the pump scheduling problem in a real-world water distribution facility. The task involves controlling pumps to ensure a reliable water supply while minimizing energy consumption and respecting the constraints of the system. Our testbed includes a realistic simulator, three years of high-resolution (1-minute) operational data from human-led control, and a baseline RL task formulation. This testbed supports a wide range of research directions, including offline RL, safe exploration, inverse RL, and multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <title>Tight Finite Time Bounds of Two-Time-Scale Linear Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm for finding the fixed point of an operator using noisy samples and widely used in optimization and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis.
  We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2.
  A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.</description>

      <title>A new framework for constrained optimization via feedback control of Lagrange multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous-time analysis of existing iterative algorithms for optimization has a long history. This work proposes a novel continuous-time control-theoretic framework for equality-constrained optimization. The key idea is to design a feedback control system where the Lagrange multipliers are the control input, and the output represents the constraints. The system converges to a stationary point of the constrained optimization problem through suitable regulation. Regarding the Lagrange multipliers, we consider two control laws: proportional-integral control and feedback linearization. These choices give rise to a family of different methods. We rigorously develop the related algorithms, theoretically analyze their convergence and present several numerical experiments to support their effectiveness concerning the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Energetic Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a malfunction causes a control system to lose authority over a subset of its actuators, achieving a task may require spending additional energy in order to compensate for the effect of uncontrolled inputs. To understand this increase in energy, we introduce an energetic resilience metric that quantifies the maximal additional energy required to achieve finite-time regulation in linear driftless systems that suffer this malfunction. We first derive optimal control signals and minimum energies to achieve this task in both the nominal and malfunctioning systems. We then obtain a bound on the worst-case energy used by the malfunctioning system, and its exact expression in the special case of loss of authority over one actuator. Further considering this special case, we derive a bound on the metric for energetic resilience. A simulation example on a model of an underwater robot demonstrates that this bound is useful in quantifying the increased energy used by a system suffering such a malfunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transformative potential of Generative AI (Gen-AI) technologies, particularly large language models, within the building industry. By leveraging these advanced AI tools, the study explores their application across key areas such as automated compliance checking and building design assistance. The research highlights how Gen-AI can automate labor-intensive processes, significantly improving efficiency and reducing costs in building practices. The paper first discusses the two widely applied fundamental models-Transformer and Diffusion model-and summarizes current pathways for accessing Gen-AI models and the most common techniques for customizing them. It then explores applications for text generation, such as compliance checking, control support, data mining, and building simulation input file editing. Additionally, it examines image generation, including direct generation through diffusion models and indirect generation through language model-supported template creation based on existing Computer-Aided Design or other design tools with rendering. The paper concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the current capabilities of Gen-AI in the building industry, outlining future directions for research and development, with the goal of paving the way for smarter, more effective, and responsive design, construction, and operational practices.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drift in Extreme Turning with Active Exploration and Gaussian Process Based MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often leads to large sideslip angles, presenting a significant challenge for vehicle control. Conventional vehicle controllers struggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting controller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces model mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue, we propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to correct vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the MPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to actively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale RC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by 52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases this error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average lateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0% reduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the inclusion of exploration.</description>

      <title>Neural Predictor for Flight Control with Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerial robotics for transporting suspended payloads as the form of freely-floating manipulator are growing great interest in recent years. However, the force/torque caused by payload and residual dynamics will introduce unmodeled perturbations to the aerial robotics, which negatively affects the closed-loop performance. Different from estimation-like methods, this paper proposes Neural Predictor, a learning-based approach to model force/torque induced by payload and residual dynamics as a dynamical system. It yields a hybrid model that combines the first-principles dynamics with the learned dynamics. The hybrid model is then integrated into a MPC framework to improve closed-loop performance. Effectiveness of proposed framework is verified extensively in both numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments. The results indicate that our approach can capture force/torque caused by suspended payload and residual dynamics accurately, respond quickly to the changes of them and improve the closed-loop performance significantly. In particular, Neural Predictor outperforms a state-of-the-art learning-based estimator and has reduced the force and torque estimation errors by up to 66.15% and 33.33% while requiring less samples. The code of proposed Neural Predictor can be found at https://github.com/NPU-RCIR/Neural-Predictor.git.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Quality Adaptation for Energy-Intensive Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy demand of modern cloud services, particularly those related to generative AI, is increasing at an unprecedented pace. To date, carbon-aware computing strategies have primarily focused on batch process scheduling or geo-distributed load balancing. However, such approaches are not applicable to services that require constant availability at specific locations due to latency, privacy, data, or infrastructure constraints.
  In this paper, we explore how the carbon footprint of energy-intensive services can be reduced by adjusting the fraction of requests served by different service quality tiers. We show that adapting this quality of responses with respect to grid carbon intensity can lead to additional carbon savings beyond resource and energy efficiency and introduce a forecast-based multi-horizon optimization that reaches close-to-optimal carbon savings.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Sensor Placement for Detecting Stochastic Target Trajectories in Barrier Coverage Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the deployment of sensors for a 2-D barrier coverage system. The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Decentralized Constraint-Coupled Optimization: A Dual$^2$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of decentralized constraint-coupled optimization problem: $\min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, i \in \mathcal{I}; y \in \mathbb{R}^p}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y) \ \text{s.t.} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y$, over an undirected and connected network of $n$ agents. Here, $f_i$, $g_i$, and $A_i$ represent private information of agent $i \in \mathcal{I} = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, while $h$ is public for all agents. Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms to solve this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, under additional assumptions, we establish linear convergence rates and derive significantly lower communication and computational complexity bounds than those of existing algorithms. Several numerical experiments validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical superiority of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.</description>
