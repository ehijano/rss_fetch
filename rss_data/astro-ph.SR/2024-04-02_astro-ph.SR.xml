      <title>Accurate PRD modeling of the forward-scattering Hanle effect in the chromospheric CaI 4227 {\AA} line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurable linear scattering polarization signals have been predicted and detected at the solar disk center in the core of chromospheric lines. These forward-scattering polarization signals, which are of high interest for magnetic field diagnostics, have always been modeled either under the assumption of complete frequency redistribution (CRD), or taking partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects into account under the angle-averaged (AA) approximation. This work aims at assessing the suitability of the CRD and PRD-AA approximations for modeling the forward-scattering polarization signals produced by the presence of an inclined magnetic field, the so-called forward-scattering Hanle effect, in the chromospheric CaI 4227 A line. Radiative transfer calculations are performed in semi-empirical 1D solar atmospheres, out of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). A two-step solution strategy is applied: the non-LTE RT problem is first solved considering a multilevel atom and neglecting polarization phenomena. The same problem is then solved including polarization, considering a two-level atom and keeping fixed the lower-level population calculated at the previous step. The emergent linear polarization signals calculated under the CRD and PRD-AA approximations are analyzed and compared to those obtained by modeling PRD effects in their general angle-dependent (AD) formulation. With respect to the PRD-AD case, the CRD and PRD-AA calculations significantly underestimate the amplitude of the line-center polarization signals produced by the forward-scattering Hanle effect. The results of this work suggest that a PRD-AD modeling is required in order to develop reliable diagnostic techniques exploiting the forward-scattering polarization signals observed in the CaI 4227 A line. These results need to be confirmed by full 3D calculations including non-magnetic symmetry-breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of the solar coronal plasmas by magnetohydrodynamic waves: Magnetohydrodynamic seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic wave and oscillatory phenomena ubiquitously detected in the plasma of the corona of the Sun are interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic theory. Fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are clearly distinguished in observations. Properties of coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves are determined by local parameters of the plasma, including the field-aligned filamentation typical for the corona. It makes coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves reliable probes of the coronal plasma structures by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology. For example, propagating slow waves indicate the local direction of the guiding magnetic field. Standing, sloshing and propagating slow waves can be used for probing the coronal heating function and the polytropic index. Kink oscillations of coronal plasma loops provide us with the estimations of the absolute value of the magnetic field in oscillating plasma loops. This tutorial introduces several techniques of magnetohydrodynamic seismology of solar coronal plasmas. It includes the description of practical steps in the data acquisition, pre-processing, and processing using the open-access data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and elaborated data analysis techniques of motion magnification and Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal broadening of coronal lines in a 3D MHD loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed spectral profiles of emission lines from the corona are found to have widths exceeding the thermal line width. To investigate the physical mechanism, we run a 3D MHD model of a single, straightened loop in which we partially resolve turbulent motions that form in response to the driving by self-consistently evolving magneto-convection in the photosphere. The convective motions shear and twist the magnetic field lines, leading to heating. From the model we synthesize spectral profiles of emission lines forming at temperatures around and above 1 MK. The coronal heating process generates a range of velocity amplitudes and directions structured on a scale much smaller than the resolving power of current instruments, leading to a broadening of the spectral lines. Our model includes the mass exchange between corona and chromosphere, thus we also capture flows parallel to the loop axis. We find that the spectral lines show a non-thermal line broadening roughly consistent with observations for a viewing angle perpendicular to the axis. The broadening through field-parallel flows is comparable, although slightly smaller. The line broadening is independent of the instrument resolution for a perpendicular line-of-sight. We can connect the non-thermal line broadening to heating events and flows. While small-scale velocities along the line-of-sight are mainly responsible for the broadening observed perpendicular to the loop, chromospheric evaporation is important for the line broadening observed along the loop. The model reproduces observed values for non-thermal line widths. In the model these result from continuous driving by magnetoconvection, without imposing driving motions or starting from an already braided field.</description>

      <title>Coronal Signatures of Flare Generated Fast Mode Wave at EUV and Radio wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the type II solar radio burst that occurred on 06 March 2014 using combined data analysis. It is a classical radio event consisting of type III radio burst and a following type II radio burst in the dynamic spectrum. The type II radio burst is observed between 235 - 130 MHz (120 - 60 MHz) in harmonic (fundamental) bands with the life time of 5 minutes between 09:26 UT - 09:31 UT. The estimated speed of type II burst by applying twofold Saito model is 650 km/s. An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave is observed with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) pass bands. The very close temporal onset association of EUV wave and flare energy release indicates that the EUV wave is likely produced by a flare pressure pulse. The eruption is also accompanied by a weak coronal mass ejection (CME) observed with the coronagraphs onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). The plane of sky speed of the CME was 252 km/s at SOHO/LASCO-C2 and 280 km/s at STEREO-B/SECCHI-COR1 FOV. The EUV wave has two wave fronts, one expanding radially outward, and the other one moving along the arcade. The source position of the type II burst imaged by the Nancay Radio Heliograph (NRH) shows that it was associated with the outward moving EUV wave. The CME is independent of the shock wave as confirmed by the location of NRH radio sources below the CME's leading edge. Therefore the type II radio burst is probably ignited by the flare. This study shows the possibility of EUV wave and coronal shock triggered by flare pressure pulse, generating the observed type II radio burst.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Longest-Period Classical Cepheid in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the classical Cepheid OGLE-GD-CEP-1884 (= GDS_J1535467-555656) with the longest pulsation period known in our Galaxy. The period of 78.14 d is nearly 10 d longer than that of the previous record-holding Cepheid, S Vulpeculae, and thus, OGLE-GD-CEP-1884 can be categorized as the first ultra long period Cepheid in the Milky Way. This star is present in the ASAS-SN and Gaia DR3 catalogs of variable stars, but it has been classified as a long-period variable in those catalogs. Based on more than 10 years of the photometric monitoring of this star carried out by the OGLE project in the I and V bands and a radial velocity curve from the Gaia Focused Product Release, we unequivocally demonstrate that this object is a fundamental-mode classical Cepheid. By employing the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation, we determine the distance to OGLE-GD-CEP-1884 (4.47 +- 0.34 kpc) and place it on the Milky Way map, along with about 2400 other classical Cepheids. We also discuss the potential of finding additional ultra long period Cepheids in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Transport of the magnetic flux away from a decaying sunspot via convective motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The aim of this paper is to consider relationship between the decay of sunspots and convection via the motion of the family of granules and how the diffusion mechanism of magnetic field operates in a decaying sunspot. Methods. We report the decay of a sunspot observed by the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) with the TiO Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) and the Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS). The analysis was aided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). In the first step, we followed the decay of the sunspot with HMI data over three days by constructing its evolving area and total magnetic flux. In the second step, the high spatial and temporal resolution of the GST instruments allowed us to analyze the causes of the decay of the sunspot. Afterward, we followed the emergence of granules in the moat region around the sunspot over six hours. The evolution of the trees of fragmenting granules (TFGs) was derived based on their relationship with the horizontal surface flows. Results. We find that the area and total magnetic flux display an exponential decrease over the course of the sunspot decay. We identified 22 moving magnetic features (MMFs) in the moats of pores, which is a signature of sunspot decay through diffusion. We note that the MMFs were constrained to follow the borders of TFGs during their journey away from the sunspot. Conclusions. The TFGs and their development contribute to the diffusion of the magnetic field outside the sunspot. The conclusion of our analysis shows the important role of the TFGs in sunspot decay. Finally, the the family of granules evacuates the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Clues in Bailey Diagrams Indicate that the Horizontal Branch Evolutionary Effect Is the Direct Reason for Oosterhoff Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noticing the potential relationship between the pulsation amplitude of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and their average effective temperatures, we derived the relation between them from observational data. Using these relationships, we present the zero-age horizontal branch lines and corresponding evolutionary tracks in the Bailey diagrams. We first find that the trends of zero-age horizontal branch lines are consistent with the distributions of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars, and there is a period shift effect in relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] &gt; -1). Main results show that evolutionary effects are the direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. The vast majority of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars are in the early stage of horizontal branch evolution, while most of the Oosterhoff II stars are near the end of the horizontal branch phase. Our Bailey diagrams can intuitively explain some Oosterhoff phenomena (e.g., long-period RR Lyrae stars in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441), and also have the potential to become an important tool for in-depth study of RR Lyrae stars. Further research is needed on the Oosterhoff dichotomy to explore the formations and evolutionary processes of the Milky Way and its substructures.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XVIII. The F-type system OO Pegasi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OO Peg is a detached eclipsing binary system containing two late-A-type stars in a circular orbit with a period of 2.985 d. Using published spectroscopic results and a light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) we determine their masses to be 1.69 +/- 0.09 and 1.74 +/- 0.06 Msun, and their radii to be 2.12 +/- 0.03 and 1.91 +/- 0.03 Rsun. The TESS data are of high quality, but discrepancies in the radial velocities from two sources prevent a precise mass measurement. The primary star is definitively hotter, larger and more luminous than its companion, but its mass is lower (albeit to a significance of only 1.1 sigma). Using published apparent magnitudes and temperatures, we find a distance of 238.8 +/- 6.1 pc, in agreement with the Gaia DR3 parallax. Although both components are in the delta Scuti instability strip, we find no evidence of pulsations. More extensive spectroscopy is needed to improve our understanding of the system.</description>

      <title>Metallicity and $\alpha$-abundance for 48 million stars in low-extinction regions in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based machine-learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and metal-poor star sample of Li et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and 0.0436 dex for [$\alpha$/M], when we evaluate our models with the test data. Our estimation is most reliable for giants and metal-rich stars, because the training data are dominated by such stars. The high-[$\alpha$/M] stars and low-[$\alpha$/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) show different kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further investigate how our machine-learning models extract information on ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]). Intriguingly, our models seem to extract information on [$\alpha$/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg I line (516 nm). This result is understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) as well as their associated uncertainties will be publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Generation and Life Cycle of Solar Spicules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical mechanism for the creation of solar spicules is proposed with three stages of their life cycle. It is assumed that at stage-I, the density hump is formed locally in the xy-plane in lower chromosphere in the presence of temperature gradients of electrons and ions along z-axis (the vertical direction). In this region, the density structure of quasi-neutral $(n_i\simeq n_e=n)$ plasma after taking birth is accelerated in the vertical direction due to the thermal force ${\bf F}_{th} \propto \nabla n(x,y,t) \times (\nabla T_e + \nabla T_i)$. The exact time-dependent analytical solution of two fluid plasma equations is presented assuming that density is maximum at the center and decays away from it gradually. The two dimensional (2D) density structure is created as a step function $H(t)$ in time at bottom of the chromosphere and consequently the vertical plasma velocity turns out to be the ramp function of time $R(t)=t H(t)$ whereas the source term $S(x,y,t)$ for the density follows the delta function $\delta(t)$ form. The upward acceleration ${\bf a}=a(x,y)\hat{z}$ produced in this density structure is greater than the downward constant solar acceleration $-{\bf g}_\odot$ in the chromosphere. In the transition region (TR), the temperature gradients are steeper; therefore, the upward acceleration increases in magnitude $g_\odot &lt;&lt; a$ and the density hump spends lesser time there. This is stage-II of its life cycle. In stage-III, the density structure enters into corona where the gradients of temperatures vanish and the structure decelerates to zero velocity under the action of the solar gravitational force.</description>

      <title>New catalog of distances to planetary nebulae based on Gaia parallaxes and statistical distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a method to determine the most reliable distances for a large group of planetary nebulae. For this purpose, we analyze the distances obtained from \textit{Gaia} parallaxes and three determinations of statistical distances. The most reliable distance is derived for 2211 objects, and uncertainties for these distances are calculated in a homogeneous way. Using our most reliable distances, we compare the distributions of Galactic heights of hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-rich central stars of planetary nebulae. We find that [WR] central stars are closer to the Galactic plane than hydrogen-rich central stars and than other hydrogen-poor central stars. The latter have a similar distribution to hydrogen-rich central stars, which is significantly different from the one of [WR] central stars. This result disagrees with the proposed evolutionary sequence for hydrogen-poor central stars.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in close orbits as Gravitational Wave Sources: Formation Scenarios and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud III. Updated Kinematics and Insights on Dynamical vs. Supernova Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.</description>

Abstract: Shock breakout emission is light that arises when a shockwave, generated by core-collapse explosion of a massive star, passes through its outer envelope. Hitherto, the earliest detection of such a signal was at several hours after the explosion, though a few others had been reported. The temporal evolution of early light curves should reveal insights into the shock propagation, including explosion asymmetry and environment in the vicinity, but this has been hampered by the lack of multiwavelength observations. Here we report the instant multiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101 (at a distance of 6.85+/-0.15 Mpc), beginning at about 1.4 hours after the explosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of about 440 solar radii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 hours, and appeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by models within the first few hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was disrupted by the shockwave. We infer that the breakout and perhaps the distribution of the surrounding dust were not spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model and Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Three-dimensional Magnetic Switchbacks</title>

Abstract: Parker Solar Probe observations reveal that the near-Sun space is almost filled with magnetic switchbacks (``switchbacks'' hereinafter), which may be a major contributor to the heating and acceleration of solar wind. Here, for the first time, we develop an analytic model of an axisymmetric switchback with uniform magnetic field strength. In this model, three parameters control the geometry of the switchback: height (length along the background magnetic field), width (thickness along radial direction perpendicular to the background field), and the radial distance from the center of switchback to the central axis, which is a proxy of the size of the switchback along the third dimension. We carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the dynamic evolution of the switchback. Comparing simulations conducted with compressible and incompressible codes, we verify that compressibility, i.e. parametric decay instability, is necessary for destabilizing the switchback. Our simulations also reveal that the geometry of the switchback significantly affects how fast the switchback destabilizes. The most stable switchbacks are 2D-like (planar) structures with large aspect ratios (length to width), consistent with the observations. We show that when plasma beta ($\beta$) is smaller than one, the switchback is more stable as $\beta$ increases. However, when $\beta$ is greater than one, the switchback becomes very unstable as the pattern of the growing compressive fluctuations changes. Our results may explain some of the observational features of switchbacks, including the large aspect ratios and nearly constant occurrence rates in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Signs of magnetic star-planet interactions in HD 118203. TESS detects stellar variability that matches the orbital period of a close-in eccentric Jupiter-sized companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary systems with close-in giant planets can experience magnetic star-planet interactions that modify the activity levels of their host stars. The induced activity is known to strongly depend on the magnetic moment of the interacting planet. Therefore, such planet-induced activity should be more readily observable in systems with planets in eccentric orbits, since those planets are expected to rotate faster than in circular orbits. However, no evidence of magnetic interactions has been reported in eccentric systems to date. We intend to unveil a possible planet-induced activity in the bright ($V$ = 8.05 $\pm$ 0.03 mag) and slightly evolved star HD 118203, which hosts an eccentric ($e$ = 0.32 $\pm$ 0.02) and close-in ($a$ = 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0006 au) Jupiter-sized planet. We characterized the system by modelling 56 ELODIE radial velocities and four sectors of TESS photometry. We searched for planet-induced and rotation-related activity signals within the TESS, ELODIE, and ASAS-SN public data. We studied the possible origins of the variability found, analysed its persistence and evolution, and searched for links with the eccentric orbital motion of HD 118203 b. We found evidence of an activity signal within the TESS data that matches the orbital period of HD 118203 b, which suggests the existence of magnetic star-planet interactions. We did not find, however, any additional signal that could be interpreted as the rotation of the star, so we cannot discard stellar rotation as the source of the signal found. Nevertheless, the evolved nature of the star and the orbital eccentricity make the synchronous stellar rotation very unlikely. HD 118203 represents the best evidence that magnetic star-planet interactions can be found in eccentric systems, and it opens the door to future dedicated searches that will allow us to better understand the interplay between close-in planets and their hosts.</description>

      <title>FORECASTOR -- I. Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and UV Research mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet Research (CASTOR) is a proposed Canadian-led 1m-class space telescope that will carry out ultraviolet and blue-optical wide-field imaging, spectroscopy, and photometry. CASTOR will provide an essential bridge in the post-Hubble era, preventing a protracted UV-optical gap in space astronomy and enabling an enormous range of discovery opportunities from the solar system to the nature of the Cosmos, in conjunction with the other great wide-field observatories of the next decade (e.g., Euclid, Roman, Vera Rubin). FORECASTOR (Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for CASTOR) will supply a coordinated suite of mission-planning tools that will serve as the one-stop shop for proposal preparation, data reduction, and analysis for the CASTOR mission. We present the first of these tools: a pixel-based, user-friendly, extensible, multi-mission exposure time calculator (ETC) built in Python, including a modern browser-based graphical user interface that updates in real time. We then provide several illustrative examples of FORECASTOR's use that advance the design of planned legacy surveys for the CASTOR mission: a search for the most massive white dwarfs in the Magellanic Clouds; a study of the frequency of flaring activity in M stars, their distribution and impacts on habitability of exoplanets; mapping the proper motions of faint stars in the Milky Way; wide and deep galaxy surveys; and time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Bayesian characterization of the young open cluster NGC 6383 using HDBSCAN and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on determining the characteristics of the young open cluster NGC 6383. To achieve this, the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm is utilized to identify potential cluster members based on proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 3. Various parameters of NGC 6383, such as tidal radius, core radius, distance through parallax and isochrone-fitting, proper motion, age, metallicity, and relevant others, are assessed. To perform this analysis, we utilize an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler. The results of this analysis point out that NGC 6383 is a very young open cluster $(\sim 1 - 4~\mathrm{Myr})$, with a distance of $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{kpc}$.</description>
