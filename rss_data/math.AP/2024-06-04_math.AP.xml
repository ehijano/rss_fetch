      <title>Time-periodic solutions of the compressible Euler equations and the Nonlinear Theory of Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of ``pure tone'' nonlinear sound waves of all frequencies. These are smooth, time periodic, oscillatory solutions of the $3\times3$ compressible Euler equations satisfying periodic or acoustic boundary conditions in one space dimension. This resolves a centuries old problem in the theory of Acoustics, by establishing that the pure modes of the linearized equations are the small amplitude limits of solutions of the nonlinear equations. Riemann's celebrated 1860 proof that compressions always form shocks is known to hold for isentropic and barotropic flows, but our proof shows that for generic entropy profiles, shock-free periodic solutions containing nontrivial compressions and rarefactions exist for every wavenumber $k$.</description>

      <title>On the three-dimensional shape of a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we completely settle the Almgren problem in $\mathbb R^3$ under some generic conditions on the potential and tension functions. The problem, among other things, appears in classical thermodynamics when one is to understand if minimizing the free energy with convex potential and under a mass constraint generates a convex crystal. Our new idea in proving a three-dimensional convexity theorem is to utilize a stability theorem when $m$ is small, convexity when $m$ is small, and the first variation PDE with a new maximum principle approach.</description>

      <title>A porous medium equation with spatially inhomogeneous absorption. Part I: Self-similar solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a two-parts work on the qualitative properties and large time behavior for the following quasilinear equation involving a spatially inhomogeneous absorption $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m-|x|^{\sigma}u^p, $$ posed for $(x,t)\in\mathbf{R}^N\times(0,\infty)$, $N\geq1$, and in the range of exponents $1&lt;m&lt;p&lt;\infty$, $\sigma&gt;0$. We give a complete classification of (singular) self-similar solutions of the form $$ u(x,t)=t^{-\alpha}f(|x|t^{-\beta}), \ \alpha=\frac{\sigma+2}{\sigma(m-1)+2(p-1)}, \ \beta=\frac{p-m}{\sigma(m-1)+2(p-1)}, $$ showing that their form and behavior strongly depends on the critical exponent $$ p_F(\sigma)=m+\frac{\sigma+2}{N}. $$ For $p\geq p_F(\sigma)$, we prove that all self-similar solutions have a tail as $\xi\to\infty$ of one of the forms $$ u(x,t)\sim C|x|^{-(\sigma+2)/(p-m)} \quad {\rm or} \quad u(x,t)\sim \left(\frac{1}{p-1}\right)^{1/(p-1)}|x|^{-\sigma/(p-1)}, $$ while for $m&lt;p&lt;p_F(\sigma)$ we add to the previous the \emph{existence and uniqueness} of a \emph{compactly supported very singular solution}. These solutions will be employed in describing the large time behavior of general solutions in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Semilinear Schr\"odinger equations with Hardy potentials involving the distance to a boundary submanifold and gradient source nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 3$) be a bounded $C^2$ domain and $\Sigma\subset\partial\Omega$ be a compact $C^2$ submanifold of dimension $k$. Denote the distance from $\Sigma$ by $d_\Sigma$. In this paper, we study positive solutions of the equation $(*)\, -\Delta u -\mu u/d_\Sigma^2 = g(u,|\nabla u|)$ in $\Omega$, where $\mu\leq \big( \frac{N-k}{2} \big)^2$ and the source term $g:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is continuous and non-decreasing in its arguments with $g(0,0)=0$. In particular, we prove the existence of solutions of $(*)$ with boundary measure data $u=\nu$ in two main cases, provided that the total mass of $\nu$ is small. In the first case $g$ satisfies some subcriticality conditions that always ensure the existence of solutions. In the second case we examine power type nonlinearity $g(u,|\nabla u|) = |u|^p|\nabla u|^q$, where the problem may not possess a solution for exponents in the supercritical range. Nevertheless we obtain criteria for existence under the assumption that $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to some appropriate capacity or the Bessel capacity of $\Sigma$, or under other equivalent conditions.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. For the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct waves with the zero mean property and prove that waves with the same property may not exist for the well known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding the spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of a convenient linear operator, restricted to the space constituted by zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. We also discuss the problem of orbital stability in the energy space.</description>

      <title>Critical curve for a weakly coupled system of semi-linear $\sigma$-evolution equations with different damping types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to consider the Cauchy problem for a weakly coupled system of semi linear $sigma$ evolution equations with different damping mechanisms for any $\sigma&gt;1$, parabolic like damping and $\sigma$ evolution like damping. Motivated strongly by the well known Nakao's problem, the main goal of this work is to determine the critical curve between the power exponents $p$ and $q$ of nonlinear terms by not only establishing the global well posedness property of small data solutions but also indicating blow up in finite time solutions. We want to point out that the application of a modified test function associated with a judicious choice of test functions really plays an essential role to show a blow up result for solutions and upper bound estimates for lifespan of solutions, where $\sigma$ is assumed to be any fractional number. To end this paper, lower bound estimates for lifespan of solutions are also shown to verify their sharp results in some spatial dimensions</description>

      <title>Temporal decay rates for weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equations with supercritical fractional dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish temporal decay for a weak solution $u(x,t)$ (with initial data $u_0$) of the Navier-Stokes equations with supercritical fractional dissipation $\alpha \in (0,\frac{5}{4})$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^3)$ ($s\leq0$). More precisely, we prove that $u$ satisfies the following upper bound: $$ \|u(t)\|_{2}^2\leq C(1+t)^{-\frac{3-2p}{2\alpha}}, \quad\forall t&gt;0.$$
  This estimate leads us to show the next inequality: $$ \|u(t)\|_{\dot{H}^{-\delta}}^2\leq C(1+t)^{-\frac{3-2\delta-2p}{2\alpha}}, \quad\forall t&gt;0.$$ These results are obtained by applying standard Fourier Analysis and they hold for $\alpha\in(0,\frac{5}{4}),$ $p\in[-1,\frac{3}{2})$, $\delta\in [0, \frac{3-2p}{2})$ and $u_0\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)\cap \mathcal{Y}^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ (and also $u_0\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $p=-1$ and a certain finite set of values of $\alpha$).</description>

      <title>Existence-Uniqueness Theory and Small-Data Decay for a Reaction-Diffusion Model of Wildfire Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine some analytical properties of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system that has been used to model the propagation of a wildfire. I establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of bounded mild solutions to the Cauchy problem for this system given bounded initial data. In particular, this shows that the model does not allow for thermal blow-up. If the initial temperature and fuel density also satisfy certain integrability conditions, all Sobolev norms of these global solutions are uniformly bounded in time. Additionally, I use a bootstrap argument to show that small initial temperatures give rise to solutions that decay to zero as time goes to infinity, proving that there exist initial states that do not develop into travelling combustion waves.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy properties of irrotational deep-water Stokes waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate kinetic energy properties of an irrotational deep-water Stokes wave. By introducing a conformal hodograph transform, we perform complex analysis in the new variables, and show that the existence of the streamline time-period for deep-water Stokes waves. Relying on the conformal mappings, we prove some qualitative results about the kinetic energy such as the convexity property of integral means of kinetic energy, the streamline time-period being non-increasing and independent of initial data and the monotonicity and logarithmic convexity of the total kinetic energy over a streamline time-period. Moreover, taking advantage of the non-increasing nature of the streamline time-period, we show that the streamline time-period strictly larger than the wave period, which suggests the fact that there are no closed paths for all particles in a deep-water Stokes flow and the drift of any streamline is positive. These results allow us to quantify the observation that the kinetic energy and the streamline time-period are larger near the free surface and decrease with increasing the depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of second order the paper shows that all Lax modes associated with their first-order formulations are linearly degenerate. This property holds for recently considered models of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics, supporting the possibility that solutions to these models generally avoid singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Quantization property of n-Laplacian mean field equation and sharp Moser-Onofri inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the following $n$-Laplacian mean field equation
  \[ \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - \Delta_n u = \lambda e^u} &amp; {\rm in} \ \ \Omega, \\ {\ \ \ \ u = 0} &amp;\ {\rm on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{array}} \right. \] \[\]
where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n \ (n\geq 2)$ and $- \Delta_n u =-{\rm div}(|\nabla u|^{n-2}\nabla u)$. We first establish the quantization property of solutions to the above $n$-Laplacian mean field equation. As an application, combining the Pohozaev identity and the capacity estimate, we obtain the sharp constant $C(n)$ of the Moser-Onofri inequality in the $n$-dimensional unit ball $B^n:=B^n(0,1)$, $$\mathop {\inf }\limits_{u \in W_0^{1,n}(B^n)}\frac{1}{ n C_n}\int_{B^n} | \nabla u|^n dx- \ln \int_{B^n} {e^u} dx\geq C(n), $$
which extends the result of Caglioti-Lions-Marchioro-Pulvirenti in \cite{Caglioti} to the case of $n$-dimensional ball. Here $C_n=(\frac{n^2}{n-1})^{n-1} \omega_{n-1}$ and $\omega_{n-1}$ is the surface measure of $B^n$. For the Moser-Onofri inequality in a general bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we apply the technique of $n$-harmonic transplantation to give the optimal concentration level of the Moser-Onofri inequality and obtain the criterion for the existence and non-existence of extremals for the Moser-Onofri inequality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work Cho et al. [Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math. 33 (2016): 145-166] the authors conjecture that the quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) $ i u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $ for $ x \in \mathbb{T}$ is globally well-posed for real initial data. While this may be true in a generic sense, we present evidence that this conjecture is false. Moreover we conjecture that the set of real initial data which blows up under the NLS dynamics is the stable manifold of the zero equilibrium for the nonlinear heat equation $ u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $.</description>

      <title>Gradient higher integrability for degenerate/singular parabolic double phase problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proves an interior gradient higher integrability result for weak solutions to the parabolic double phase problems. The prototype equation for the parabolic double phase problem of $p$-Laplace type reads as $$u_t - {\rm div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+ a(z)|\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u\right)=0$$ where $\frac{2n}{n+2}&lt;p\leq q &lt; \infty$ and the coefficient $a(z)$ is a non-negative H\"{o}lder continuous function on $\Omega_T=\Omega \times (0, T),$ $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}.$ Recently, this problem has been studied by Kim, Kinnunen and Moring [19] for the degenerate case and Kim and S\"{a}rki\"{o} [20] for the singular case. We introduce a new intrinsic scaling that can handle the degenerate and the singular case simultaneously. This scaling can also be used to obtain similar results in the variable exponent case.</description>

      <title>Bilinear embedding for perturbed divergence-form operator with complex coefficients on irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be open, $A$ a complex uniformly strictly accretive $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on $\Omega$ with $L^{\infty}$ coefficients, $b$ and $c$ two $d$-dimensional vector-valued functions on $\Omega$ with $L^{\infty}$ coefficients and $V$ a locally integrable nonegative function on $\Omega$. Consider the operator ${\mathscr L}^{A,b,c,V}=-{\rm div}\,(A\nabla) + \left\langle \nabla , b \right\rangle - {\rm div}\,(c \, \cdot) + V $ with mixed boundary conditions on $\Omega$. We extend the bilinear inequality that Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c proved in the special cases when $b=c = 0$. As a consequence, we obtain that the solution to the parabolic problem $u^{\prime}(t)+{\mathscr L}^{A,b,c,V}u(t)=f(t)$, $u(0)=0$, has maximal regularity in $L^{p}(\Omega)$, for all $p&gt;1$ such that $A$ satisfies the $p$-ellipticity condition that Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c introduced in arXiv:1611.00653 and $b,c,V$ satisfy another condition that we introduce in this paper. Roughly speaking, $V$ has to be ``big'' with respect to $b$ and $c$. We do not impose any conditions on $\Omega$, in particular, we do not assume any regularity of $\partial\Omega$, nor the existence of a Sobolev embedding.</description>

      <title>On the equations of compressible fluid dynamics with Cattaneo-type extensions for the heat flux: Symmetrizability and relaxation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is twofold. From a mathematical point of view, we show the existence of a hyperbolic system of equations that is not symmetrizable in the sense of Friedrichs. Such system appears in the theory of compressible fluid dynamics with Cattaneo-type extensions for the heat flux. In contrast, the linearizations of such system around constant equilibrium solutions have Friedrichs symmetrizers. Then, from a physical perspective, we aim to understand the relaxation term appearing in this system. By noticing the violation of the Kawashima-Shizuta condition, locally and smoothly, with respect to the Fourier frequencies, we construct persistent waves, i.e., solutions preserving the $L^{2}$ norm for all times that are not dissipated by the relaxation terms.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Algebraic Reductibility Experiments of RANS equations with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we show the existence and uniqueness of the two-dimensional turbulent vorticity term under conditions given on the weak solutions to the classical incompressible Navier-Stokes problem in a compact domain $R$ with periodic boundary conditions and initial conditions in Sobolev space $H^m(R)$. To achieve this, we derive a pressureless incompressible system and calculate kinetic energy quantities on the turbulent vorticity from the properties of the classical curl. Finally, since the system obtained is algebraic, we experimented with the possibilities of reducing it by applying the Rosenfeld-Groebner algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions of a Time-Delay Advection Equation and a Fractional Time-Delay Advection Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions are derived for a time-delay advection equation and a fractional-order time-delay advection equation with a time-delay in the spatial derivative. Solutions are obtained, for arbitrary separable initial conditions, by incorporating recently introduced delay functions in a separation of variables approach. Examples are provided showing oscillatory and translatory behaviours fundamentally different to standard propagating wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Sharp dispersive estimates for the wave equation on the 5-dimensional lattice graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schultz \cite{S98} proved dispersive estimates for the wave equation on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d=2,3,$ which was extended to $d=4$ in \cite{BCH23}. By Newton polyhedra and the algorithm introduced by Karpushkin \cite{K83}, we further extend the result to $d=5:$ the sharp decay rate of the fundamental solution of the wave equation on $\mathbb{Z}^5$ is $|t|^{-\frac{11}{6}}.$ Moreover, we prove Strichartz estimates and give applications to nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Condition for Blowup of the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation with Positive Initial Energy in FLRW Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate a sufficient condition for blowup of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with arbitrarily positive initial energy in Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. This is accomplished using an established concavity method that has been employed for similar PDEs in Minkowski space. This proof relies on the energy inequality associated with this equation, $E(t_0)\geq E(t)$, also proved herein using a geometric method.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of viscosity solutions to complex Hessian equations on a compact Hermitian manifold that satisfy a determinant domination condition. This viscosity solution is shown to be unique when the right hand is strictly monotone increasing in terms of the solution. When the right hand side does not depend on the solution, we reduces it to the strict monotonicity of the solvability constant.</description>

Abstract: Using the generalized Young measure theory, we extend the theory of Young measure solutions to a class of quasilinear parabolic equations with linear growth, and introduce the concept of generalized Young measure solutions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the generalized Young measure solutions. In addition, for the gradient flow of convex parabolic variational integral, we show that the generalized Young measure solutions are equivalent to the strong solutions.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of an anisotropic rigid body interacting with a Poiseuille flow in an unbounded 2D channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of an elliptic rigid body which is allowed to vertically translate and rotate in a 2D unbounded channel under the action of a Poiseuille flow at large distances. The motion of the fluid is modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the motion of the solid is described through Newton's laws. In addition to the solid  inertia and the hydrodynamic forces, we assume the dynamics of the solid is driven by internal elastic restoring forces but without any structural damping. Through a precise description of the motion of the elliptic body whenever it comes close to the channel boundaries, we prove global-in-time existence of weak solutions. Our second main contribution is a proof of return to equilibrium in case the amplitude of the Poiseuille flow is small. \black To our knowledge,  this represents the first long-time analysis of fluid-solid interaction problems with a given non-trivial final state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the primitive equations for the ocean and atmosphere on two particular domains : a bounded domain $\Omega_1 := (-1, 1)^3$ with periodic boundary conditions and the strip $\Omega_2 := \mathbb{R}^2 \times (-1, 1)$ with a periodic boundary condition for the vertical coordinate. An existence theorem for global solutions on a suitable Besov space is derived. Then, in a second step, we rigorously justify the passage to the limit from the rescaled anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations to these primitive equations in the same functional framework as that found for the solutions of the primitive equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the fully dynamic Biot-Allard model, which includes memory effects. Convolution integrals in time model the history of the porous medium. We use a series representation of the dynamic permeability in the frequency domain to rewrite the equations in a coupled system without convolution integrals, suitable for the design of efficient numerical approximation schemes. The main result is the well-posedness of the system, proved by the abstract theory of R. Picard for evolutionary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study partial data inverse problems for linear and nonlinear parabolic equations with unknown time-dependent coefficients. In particular, we prove uniqueness results for partial data inverse problems for semilinear reaction-diffusion equations where Dirichlet boundary data and Neumann measurements of solutions are restricted to any open subset of the boundary. We also prove injectivity of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to heat equations. Our proof consists of two crucial ingredients; (i) we introduce an asymptotic family of spherical quasimodes that approximately solve heat equations modulo an exponentially decaying remainder term and (ii) the asymptotic study of a weighted Laplace transform of the unknown coefficient along a straight line segment in the domain where the weight may be viewed as a semiclassical symbol that itself depends on the complex-valued frequency. The latter analysis will rely on Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f principle and Gr\"{o}nwall inequality.</description>

We obtain a sequence of solutions with diverging energy that is different from that obtained by McLeod, Stuart, and Troy. In addition, we consider a more general nonlinearity, controlled by an \textit{N}-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse obstacle problem for the Laplace's equation. The aim is to recover the constant conductivity coefficient in the equation and the boundary of a Dirichlet polygonal obstacle from a single pair of Cauchy data. Uniqueness results are established under some a priori assumptions on the input boundary value data. A domain-defined sampling method, based on the factorization method originating from inverse acoustic scattering, has been proposed to recover both the constant conductivity coefficient and the polygonal obstacle. A hybrid strategy, which combines the sampling method and iterative scheme, is employed {\color{hgh}to reconstruct} the location and shape of the obstacle. Numerical examples indicate that our method is efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher Sobolev and H\"older regularity is studied for local weak solutions of the fractional $p$-Laplace equation of order $s$ in the case $p\ge 2$. Depending on the regime considered, i.e. $$0&lt;s\le\tfrac{p-2}{p}\quad \text{or} \quad\tfrac{p-2}{p}&lt;s&lt;1,$$ precise local estimates are proven. The relevant estimates are stable if the fractional order $s$ reaches $1$; the known Sobolev regularity estimates for the local $p$-Laplace are recovered. The case $p=2$ reproduces the almost $W^{1+s,2}_{\rm loc}$-regularity for the fractional Laplace equation of any order $s\in(0,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a quantitative dichotomy for the top Lyapunov exponent of a class of non-dissipative SDEs on a compact manifold in the small noise limit. Specifically, we prove that in this class, either the Lyapunov exponent is zero for all noise strengths, or it is positive for all noise strengths and that the decay of the exponent in the small-noise limit cannot be faster than linear in the noise parameter. As an application, we study the top Lyapunov exponent for the motion of a charged particle in randomly-fluctuating magnetic fields, which also involves an interesting geometric control problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms on a balanced manifold endowed with an $L^2$ metric. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson and Chen-He in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and the existence of weak solution is shown for the Dirichlet problem, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criteria for prescribing volume forms that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we show that the existence of solutions can be established under this assumption</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the volumes of transcendental and possibly non-closed Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-classes on an arbitrary compact complex manifold $X$. We show that the latter belongs to the class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki if and only if it has the $\textit{bounded mass property}$ -- i.e., its Monge-Amp\`ere volumes have a uniform upper-bound -- and there exists a closed Bott-Chern class with positive volume. This yields a positive answer to a conjecture of Demailly-P\u{a}un-Boucksom. To this end we extend to the hermitian context the notion of non-pluripolar products of currents, allowing for the latter to be merely ${\it quasi}$-${\it closed}$ and ${\it quasi}$-${\it positive}$. We establish a quasi-monotonicity property of Monge-Amp\`ere masses, and moreover show the existence of solutions to degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in big classes, together with uniform a priori estimates. This extends to the hermitian context fundamental results of Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sub-Finsler prescribed mean curvature equation, associated to a strictly convex body $K_0 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2n}$, for $t$-graphs on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. When the prescribed datum $H$ is constant and strictly smaller that the Finsler mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$, we prove the existence of a Lipschitz solution to the Dirichlet problem for the sub-Finsler CMC equation by means of a Finsler approximation scheme.</description>

Abstract: The cost functions considered are $c(x,y)=h(x-y)$, where $h\in C^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, homogeneous of degree $p\geq 2$, with a positive definite Hessian in the unit sphere. We study multivalued monotone maps with respect to that cost and establish that they are single-valued almost everywhere. Further consequences are then deduced.</description>

      <title>The vanishing limit of a rigid body in three-dimensional viscous incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a small rigid body in an incompressible viscous fluid filling the whole space $\rline^3$. When the small rigid body shrinks to a "massless" point in the sense that its density is constant, we prove that the solution of the fluid-rigid body system converges to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the full space. Based on some $L^p-L^q$ estimates of the fluid-structure semigroup and a fixed point argument, we obtain a uniform estimate of velocity of the rigid body. This allows us to construct admissible test functions which plays a key role in the procedure of passing to the limit.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity limit for axisymmetric vortex rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $R^3$ with low viscosity $\nu&gt;0$, we consider the Cauchy problem with initial vorticity $\omega_0$ that represents an infinitely thin vortex filament of arbitrary given strength $\Gamma$ supported on a circle. The vorticity field $\omega(x,t)$ of the solution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of thickness $\sqrt{\nu t}$ that is translated along its symmetry axis due to self-induction, an effect anticipated by Helmholtz in 1858 and quantified by Kelvin in 1867. For small viscosities, we show that $\omega(x,t)$ is well-approximated on a large time interval by $\omega_{lin}(x-a(t),t)$, where $\omega_{lin}(\cdot,t)=\exp(\nu t\Delta)\omega_0$ is the solution of the heat equation with initial data $\omega_0$, and $\dot a(t)$ is the instantaneous velocity given by Kelvin's formula. This gives a rigorous justification of the binormal motion for circular vortex filaments in weakly viscous fluids. The proof relies on the construction of a precise approximate solution, using a perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. To verify the stability of this approximation, one needs to rule out potential instabilities coming from very large advection terms in the linearized operator. This is done by adapting V. I. Arnold's geometric stability methods developed in the inviscid case $\nu=0$ to the slightly viscous situation. It turns out that although the geometric structures behind Arnold's approach are no longer preserved by the equation for $\nu &gt; 0$, the relevant quadratic forms behave well on larger subspaces than those originally used in Arnold's theory and interact favorably with the viscous terms.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Stabilizability of the Linearized Compressible Navier-Stokes System with Maxwell's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the control properties of the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes system with Maxwell's law around a constant steady state $(\rho_s, u_s, 0), \rho_s&gt;0, u_s&gt;0$ in the interval $(0, 2\pi)$ with periodic boundary data. We explore the exact controllability of the coupled system by means of a localized interior control acting in any of the equations when time is large enough. We also study the boundary exact controllability of the linearized system using a single control force when the time is sufficiently large. In both cases, we prove the exact controllability of the system in the space $L^2(0,2\pi)\times L^2(0, 2\pi)\times L^2(0, 2\pi)$. We establish the exact controllability results by proving an observability inequality with the help of an Ingham-type inequality. Moreover, we prove that the system is exactly controllable at any time if the control acts everywhere in the domain in any of the equations. Next, we prove the small time lack of controllability of the concerned system.
  Further, using a Gramian-based approach demonstrated by Urquiza, we prove the exponential stabilizability of the corresponding closed-loop system with an arbitrary prescribed decay rate using boundary feedback control law.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to Schr\"odinger equations in the strongly sublinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = g(u) \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \] coupled with the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2\,dx = \rho^2$, with $N\ge2$. The behaviour of $g$ at the origin is allowed to be strongly sublinear, i.e., $\lim_{s\to0}g(s)/s = -\infty$, which includes the case \[ g(s) = \alpha s \ln s^2 + \mu |s|^{p-2} s \] with $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, $2 &lt; p \le 2^*$ properly chosen. We consider a family of approximating problems that can be set in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and the corresponding least-energy solutions, then we prove that such a family of solutions converges to a least-energy one to the original problem. Additionally, under certain assumptions about $g$ that allow us to work in a suitable subspace of $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions.</description>

      <title>Fluid-poroviscoelastic structure interaction problem with nonlinear geometric coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate weak solutions to a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem between the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and a poroviscoelastic medium modeled by the Biot equations. These systems are coupled nonlinearly across an interface with mass and elastic energy, modeled by a reticular plate equation, which is transparent to fluid flow. We provide a constructive proof of the existence of a weak solution to a regularized problem. Next, a weak-classical consistency result is obtained, showing that the weak solution to the regularized problem converges, as the regularization parameter approaches zero, to a {{classical}} solution to the original problem, when such a classicalsolution exists. While the assumptions in the first step only require the Biot medium to be poroelastic, the second step requires additional regularity, namely, that the Biot medium is poroviscoelastic. This is the first weak solution existence result for an FSI problem with nonlinear coupling involving a Biot model for poro(visco)elastic media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Calder\'on problem for systems with unknown zeroth and first order terms, and improve on previously known results. More precisely, let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, let $A$ be a connection matrix on $E = M \times \mathbb{C}^r$ and let $Q$ be a matrix potential. Let $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ be the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the associated connection Laplacian with a potential. Under the assumption that $(M, g)$ is isometrically contained in the interior of $(\mathbb{R}^2 \times M_0, c(e \oplus g_0))$, where $(M_0, g_0)$ is an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, $e$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $c &gt; 0$, we show that $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ uniquely determines $(A, Q)$ up to natural gauge invariances. This generalises earlier work of Eskin to anisotropic geometries. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of complex ray transform and complex parallel transport problem, and study their fundamental properties and relations to the Calder\'on problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We capture optimal decay for the Mullins-Sekerka evolution, a nonlocal, parabolic free boundary problem from materials science. Our main result establishes convergence of BV solutions to the planar profile in the physically relevant case of ambient space dimension three. Far from assuming small or well-prepared initial data, we allow for initial interfaces that do not have graph structure and are not connected, hence explicitly including the regime of Ostwald ripening. In terms only of initially finite (not small) excess mass and excess surface energy, we establish that the surface becomes a Lipschitz graph within a fixed timescale (quantitatively estimated) and remains trapped within this setting. To obtain the graph structure, we leverage regularity results from geometric measure theory. At the same time, we extend a duality method previously employed for one-dimensional PDE problems to higher dimensional, nonlocal geometric evolutions. Optimal algebraic decay rates of excess energy, dissipation, and graph height are obtained.</description>

Abstract: We show convergence of solutions of a convective Allen-Cahn equation for a given smooth and divergence free velocity field to a transport equation for an evolving interface in the case when the thickness of the diffuse interface tends to zero and the mobility coefficient is proportional to the interfacial thickness. This is done for well-prepared initial data by estimating the difference of the exact and an approximate solution of the convective Allen-Cahn equation with the aid of a uniform lower bound for the linearized Allen-Cahn operator. The approximate solution is constructed with the aid of three terms from formally matched asymptotics calculations close to the interface.</description>

      <title>The sequence of pseudo-equilibria describes the long-time behaviour of the NNLIF model with large delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a wide range of mathematical models that describe populations of large numbers of neurons. In this article, we focus on nonlinear noisy leaky integrate and fire (NNLIF) models that describe neuronal activity at the level of the membrane potential of neurons. We introduce a set of novel states, which we call "pseudo-equilibria", and give evidence of their defining role in the behaviour of the NNLIF system when a significant synaptic delay is considered. The advantage is that these states are determined solely by the system's parameters and are derived from a sequence of firing rates that result from solving a recurrence equation. We propose a new strategy to show convergence to an equilibrium for a weakly connected system with large transmission delay, based on following the sequence of pseudo-equilibria. Unlike with the direct entropy dissipation method, this technique allows us to see how a large delay favours convergence. We also present a detailed numerical study to support our results. This study explores the overall behaviour of the NNLIF system and helps us understand, among other phenomena, periodic solutions in strongly inhibitory networks.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit solution representations for linear, dissipative, second-order Initial-Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) with coefficients that are spatially varying, with linear, constant-coefficient, two-point boundary conditions. We accomplish this by considering the variable-coefficient problem as the limit of a constant-coefficient interface problem, previously solved using the Unified Transform Method of Fokas. Our method produces an explicit representation of the solution, allowing us to determine properties of the solution directly. As explicit examples, we demonstrate the solution procedure for different IBVPs of variations of the heat equation, and the linearized complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation (periodic boundary conditions). We can use this to find the eigenvalues of dissipative second-order linear operators (including non-self-adjoint ones) as roots of a transcendental function, and we can write their eigenfunctions explicitly in terms of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Space-time deep neural network approximations for high-dimensional partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is one of the most challenging issues in applied mathematics to approximately solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) and most of the numerical approximation methods for PDEs in the scientific literature suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations employed in the corresponding approximation scheme to obtain an approximation precision $\varepsilon&gt;0$ grows exponentially in the PDE dimension and/or the reciprocal of $\varepsilon$. Recently, certain deep learning based approximation methods for PDEs have been proposed and various numerical simulations for such methods suggest that deep neural network (DNN) approximations might have the capacity to indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters used to describe the approximating DNNs grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$. There are now also a few rigorous results in the scientific literature which substantiate this conjecture by proving that DNNs overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating solutions of PDEs. Each of these results establishes that DNNs overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating suitable PDE solutions at a fixed time point $T&gt;0$ and on a compact cube $[a,b]^d$ in space but none of these results provides an answer to the question whether the entire PDE solution on $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ can be approximated by DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. It is precisely the subject of this article to overcome this issue. More specifically, the main result of this work in particular proves for every $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $ b\in (a,\infty)$ that solutions of certain Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated by DNNs on the space-time region $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ without the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the empirical distribution of the complex roots of high-degree random polynomials, when the polynomial undergoes the heat flow. In one prominent example of Weyl polynomials, the limiting zero distribution evolves from the circular law into the elliptic law until it collapses to the Wigner semicircle law, as was recently conjectured for characteristic polynomials of random matrices by Hall and Ho, 2022. Moreover, for a general family of random polynomials with independent coefficients and isotropic limiting distribution of zeros, we determine the zero distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials in terms of its logarithmic potential. Furthermore, we explicitly identify two critical time thresholds, at which singularities develop and at which the limiting distribution collapses to the semicircle law. We completely characterize the limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials before singularities develop as the push-forward of the initial distribution under a transport map. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspectives of partial differential equations (in particular Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Burgers' equation), optimal transport, and free probability. The theory is accompanied by explicit examples, simulations, and conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concise PDE-based proof of anomalous diffusion in the Kraichan model -- a stochastic, white-in-time model of passive scalar turbulence. That is, we show an exponential rate of $L^2$ decay in expectation of a passive scalar advected by a certain white-in-time, correlated-in-space, divergence-free Gaussian field, uniform in the initial data and the diffusivity of the passive scalar. Additionally, we provide examples of correlated-in-time versions of the Kraichnan model which fail to exhibit anomalous diffusion despite their (formal) white-in-time limits exhibiting anomalous diffusion. As part of this analysis, we prove that anomalous diffusion of a scalar advected by some flow implies non-uniqueness of the ODE trajectories of that flow.</description>

      <title>Consistency of semi-supervised learning, stochastic tug-of-war games, and the p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a broad overview of the intersection of partial differential equations (PDEs) and graph-based semi-supervised learning. The overview is focused on a large body of recent work on PDE continuum limits of graph-based learning, which have been used to prove well-posedness of semi-supervised learning algorithms in the large data limit. We highlight some interesting research directions revolving around consistency of graph-based semi-supervised learning, and present some new results on the consistency of $p$-Laplacian semi-supervised learning using the stochastic tug-of-war game interpretation of the $p$-Laplacian. We also present the results of some numerical experiments that illustrate our results and suggest directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Wright-Fisher stochastic heat equations with irregular drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the $[0,1]$-valued continuous random field solution $(u_t(x))_{t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb R}$ to the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation \[ \partial_t u_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta u_t + b(u_t) + \sqrt{u_t(1-u_t)} \dot W, \] where $b(1)\leq 0\leq b(0)$ and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise. In this paper, we establish the weak existence and uniqueness of the above equation for a class of drifts $b(u)$ that may be irregular at the points where the noise coefficient is non-Lipschitz and degenerate, specifically at $u=0$ or $u=1$. This class of drifts includes non-Lipschitz drifts like $b(u) = u^q(1-u)$ for every $q\in (0,1)$, and some discontinuous drifts like $b(u) = \mathbf 1_{(0,1]}(u)-u$. This demonstrates a regularization effect of the multiplicative space-time white noise without the standard assumption that the noise coefficient is Lipschitz and non-degenerate.
  The method we apply is a further development of a moment duality technique that uses branching-coalescing Brownian motions as the dual particle system. To handle an irregular drift in the above equation, particles in the dual system are allowed to have a number of offspring with infinite expectation, and even an infinite number of offspring with positive probability. We show that, even though the branching mechanism with an infinite number of offspring causes explosions in finite time, immediately after each explosion, the total population comes down from infinity due to the coalescing mechanism. Our results on this dual particle system are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Half Space Property in RCD(0,N) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for $RCD(0,N)$ spaces, namely that if $(X,d,m)$ is a parabolic $RCD(0,N)$ space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a locally perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices. If the assumption of local perimeter minimizing is strengthened into global perimeter minimizing, then the conclusion can be strengthened into uniqueness of the horizontal slice. As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature. On the way of proving the main results, we also obtain some properties of Green's functions on $RCD(K,N)$ spaces that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Continuous family of surfaces translating by powers of Gauss curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows the existence of convex translating surfaces under the flow by the $\alpha$-th power of Gauss curvature for the sub-affine-critical regime $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/4$. The key aspect of our study is that our ansatz at infinity is the graph of homogeneous functions whose level sets are closed curves shrinking under the flow by the $\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$-th power of curvature. For each ansatz, we construct a family of translating surfaces generated by the Jacobi fields with effective growth rates. Moreover, the construction shows quantitative estimate on the rate of convergence between different translators to each other, which is required to show the continuity of the family. As a result, the family is regarded as a topological manifold. The construction in this paper will become the ground of forthcoming research, where we aim to prove that every translating surface must correspond to one of the solutions obtained herein, classifying translating surfaces and identifying the topology of the moduli space.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski type inequality in warped cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Minkowski type inequality for weakly mean convex and star-shaped hypersurfaces in warped cylinders which are asymptotically flat or hyperbolic. In particular, we show that this sharp inequality holds for outward minimizing hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold using the weak solution of the inverse mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler families of Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>
