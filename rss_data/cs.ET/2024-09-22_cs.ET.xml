      <title>Optical training of large-scale Transformers and deep neural networks with direct feedback alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOps. We perform optical training of one of the most recent deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on both language and vision tasks. We study the compute scaling of our hybrid optical approach, and demonstrate a potential advantage for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</description>

      <title>Protecting Africa's Future: Cybersecurity Strategies for Child Safety, Learning, and Skill Acquisition in Tanzania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, children across Africa are at a growing risk from the Internet. Dangers include harmful content, violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect. All these have increased due to increased mobile and Internet technology use, which not only places their safety at risk but also affects their ability to learn essential skills for their future. This paper provides an overview of the unique challenges faced by third-world African countries in ensuring the online safety of children while also supporting their developmental needs. It highlights effective practices and policies adopted by other nations to safeguard children from online threats and enhance their digital literacy. We are focusing on sharing the best practices and policies other countries have used to protect children from abuse and help them succeed in the digital world. The study emphasizes the online safety strategies, legal frameworks, and recommendations specific to the United Republic of Tanzania, along with the significance of international collaborations with organizations like UNICEF and the UN. The goal is to provide African policymakers, educators, and cybersecurity professionals with practical guidance and recommendations to strengthen child online safety initiatives both within and beyond the continent.</description>

      <title>Proxion: Uncovering Hidden Proxy Smart Contracts for Finding Collision Vulnerabilities in Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proxy design pattern allows Ethereum smart contracts to be simultaneously immutable and upgradeable, in which an original contract is split into a proxy contract containing the data storage and a logic contract containing the implementation logic. This architecture is known to have security issues, namely function collisions and storage collisions between the proxy and logic contracts, and has been exploited in real-world incidents to steal users' millions of dollars worth of digital assets. In response to this concern, several previous works have sought to identify proxy contracts in Ethereum and detect their collisions. However, they all fell short due to their limited coverage, often restricting analysis to only contracts with available source code or past transactions.
  To bridge this gap, we present Proxion, an automated cross-contract analyzer that identifies all proxy smart contracts and their collisions in Ethereum. What sets Proxion apart is its ability to analyze hidden smart contracts that lack both source code and past transactions. Equipped with various techniques to enhance efficiency and accuracy, Proxion outperforms the state-of-the-art tools, notably identifying millions more proxy contracts and thousands of unreported collisions. We apply Proxion to analyze over 36 million alive contracts from 2015 to 2023, revealing that 54.2% of them are proxy contracts, and about 1.5 million contracts exhibit at least one collision issue.</description>

      <title>Maturity of Vehicle Digital Twins: From Monitoring to Enabling Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Digital twinning of vehicles is an iconic application of digital twins, as the concept of twinning dates back to the twinning of NASA space vehicles. Although digital twins (DTs) in the automotive industry have been recognized for their ability to improve efficiency in design and manufacturing, their potential to enhance land vehicle operation has yet to be fully explored. Most existing DT research on vehicle operations, aside from the existing body of work on autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), focuses on electrified passenger cars. However, the use and value of twinning varies depending on the goal, whether it is to provide cost-efficient and sustainable freight transport without disruptions, sustainable public transport focused on passenger well-being, or fully autonomous vehicle operation. In this context, DTs are used for a range of applications, from real-time battery health monitoring to enabling fully autonomous vehicle operations. This leads to varying requirements, complexities, and maturities of the implemented DT solutions. This paper analyzes recent trends in DT-driven efficiency gains for freight, public, and autonomous vehicles and discusses their required level of maturity based on a maturity tool. The application of our DT maturity tool reveals that most DTs have reached level 3 and enable real-time monitoring. Additionally, DTs of level 5 already exist in closed environments, allowing for restricted autonomous operation.</description>

      <title>QAMNet: Fast and Efficient Optical QAM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12305</link>

Abstract: The energy consumption of neural network inference has become a topic of paramount importance with the growing success and adoption of deep neural networks. Analog optical neural networks (ONNs) can reduce the energy of matrix-vector multiplication in neural network inference below that of digital electronics. However, realizing this promise remains challenging due to digital-to-analog conversion: even at low bit precisions $b$, encoding the $2^b$ levels of digital weights and inputs into the analog domain requires specialized and power-hungry electronics. Faced with similar challenges, the field of telecommunications has developed the complex-valued Quadrature-Amplitude Modulation (QAM), the workhorse modulation format for decades. QAM maximally exploits the complex amplitude to provide a quadratic $O(N^2) \to O(N)$ energy saving over intensity-only modulation. Inspired by this advantage, this work introduces QAMNet, an optical neural network hardware and architecture with superior energy consumption to existing ONNs, that fully utilizes the complex nature of the amplitude of light with QAM. When implemented with conventional telecommunications equipment, we show that QAMNet accelerates complex-valued deep neural networks with accuracies indistinguishable from digital hardware, based on physics-based simulations. Compared to standard ONNs, we find that QAMNet ONNs: (1) attain higher accuracy above moderate levels of total bit precision, (2) are more accurate above low energy budgets, and (3) are an optimal choice when hardware bit precision is limited.</description>
