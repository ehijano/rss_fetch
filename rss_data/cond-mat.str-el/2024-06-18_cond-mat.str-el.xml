      <title>A spin chain with non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric boundary couplings: exact solution, dissipative Kondo effect, and phase transitions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric non-Hermitian model where a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin chain is coupled to two spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurities at its boundaries with coupling strengths that are complex conjugates of each other. Solving the model by means of a combination of the Bethe Ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we show that the model exhibits three distinct boundary phases: a $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetric phase with a dissipative Kondo effect, a phase with bound modes and spontaneously broken $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry, and a phase with an effectively unscreened spin (i.e. a free local moment). In the Kondo and the unscreened phases, the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry is unbroken, and hence all states have real energies, whereas in the bound mode phases, in addition to the states with real energies, there exist states with complex energy eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs, signaling spontaneous breaking of the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry. The exact solution is used to provide an accessible benchmark for DMRG with a non-Hermitian matrix product operator representation that demonstrates an accuracy comparable to its Hermitian limit thus showing the power of DMRG to handle non-Hermitian many body calculations.</description>

      <title>Spin waves in Dirac semimetal Ca$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$MnSb$_2$ investigated with neutrons by the diffraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report neutron diffraction measurements of Ca$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$MnSb$_2$, a low-carrier-density Dirac semimetal in which the antiferromagnetic Mn layers are interleaved with Sb layers that host Dirac fermions. We have discovered that we can detect a good quality inelastic spin wave signal from a small (m ~ 0.28 g) single crystal sample by the diffraction method, without energy analysis, using a neutron diffractometer with a position-sensitive area detector; the spin-waves appear as diffuse scattering that is shaped by energy-momentum conservation. By fitting this characteristic magnetic scattering to a spin-wave model, we refine all parameters of the model spin Hamiltonian, including the inter-plane interaction, through use of a three-dimensional measurement in reciprocal space. We also measure the temperature dependence of the spin waves, including the softening of the spin gap on approaching the Neel temperature, $T_N$. Not only do our results provide important new insights into an interplay of magnetism and Dirac electrons, they also establish a new, high-throughput approach to characterizing magnetic excitations on a modern diffractometer without direct energy analysis. Our work opens exciting new opportunities for the follow-up parametric and compositional studies on small, ~0.1 g crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast carrier dynamics throughout the three-dimensional Brillouin zone of the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we examine the unoccupied electronic structure and electron dynamics of the type-I Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$. Using the ability to change the probe photon energy over a wide range, we identify the predicted Weyl points in the unoccupied three-dimensional band structure and we discuss the effect of $k_\perp$ broadening in the normally unoccupied states. We characterise the electron dynamics close to the Weyl point and in other parts of three-dimensional Brillouin zone using $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique. This reveals distinct differences -- in particular, dynamics that are faster in the parts of the Brillouin zone that host most of the bulk Fermi surface than in parts close to the Weyl points.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics in a three-dimensional Brillouin zone analysed by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron dynamics in the unoccupied states of the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ is studied by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). The measurement's result is the photoemission intensity $I$ as a function of at least four parameters: the emission angle and kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, the time delay between pump and probe laser pulses, and the probe laser photon energy that needs to be varied to access the full three-dimensional Brillouin zone of the material. The TR-ARPES results are reported in an accompanying paper. Here we focus on the technique of using $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique, in order to discover trends in the four-dimensional data sets. We study how to compare the electron dynamics across the entire data set and how to reveal subtle variations between different data sets collected in the vicinity of the bulk Weyl points.</description>

      <title>Landau-Lifshitz damping from Lindbladian dissipation in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not linked to the established quantum theory of dissipation based on the Lindbladian master equation. This is an unsatisfactory conceptual caveat for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics. Thereby, the successful LL approach is set generally on a firm quantum basis. The key aspect is that the Lindbladian relaxation must be adapted to the Hamiltonian $H(t)$ at each instant of time in time-dependent non-equilibrium systems. It is conjectured that this idea holds true well beyond the damping of magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Class of Exactly Solvable Hamiltonians for S=1/2 Quantum Magnets with Spinless Fermionic Excitations in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution summarizes the main results of a work on exactly solvable Hamiltonians for quantum magnets. A class of Hamiltonians which supports fractionalized spinless fermionic excitations in dimensions greater than one is written down. A well-known one-dimensional example is that of S=1/2 spin chains with Luttinger liquid physics and spinless fermionic excitations that are also called spinons. A well-known two-dimensional example is that of Kitaev's S=1/2 honeycomb model with bond-dependent magnetic couplings which supports Majorana fermionic excitations. The class of models to be discussed here also exploits bond-dependent couplings in a different way to non-perturbatively stabilize spinless fermionic spinons and also Majorana fermions. A more detailed account of these results is being prepared for publication elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Weakly first-order melting of the 1/3 plateau in the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of the 1/3 plateau in the Shastry-Sutherland model with infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) by performing the imaginary time evolution of the infinite temperature density matrix. We show that both the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ broken symmetries of the ground states are restored at a unique temperature where the correlation length has a peak, and that the melting of the plateau occurs via a single weakly first-order transition. We focus on the experimentally relevant coupling constants deep into the 1/3 plateau phase at $h = 1$ and $J'/J = 0.63$, which was estimated to describe the SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ compound. By computing the free energy we are able to locate the transition temperature around $T_c \simeq 4.8$K well above the temperature $T=2$K, at which the 1/3 plateau was observed in experiments. The investigation is supplemented by adding a bias term to the Hamiltonian and studying the induced crossover. We further map the transition line in the field-temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Intraband collective excitations in fractional Chern insulators are dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy collective excitations of semiconductors and insulators often couple strongly to light, allowing them to be probed optically. We argue here that in fractional Chern insulators intra-band collective excitations are dark in the sense that they couple anomalously weakly to light. This conclusion is based on a relationship between ideal quantum geometry and the structure factor of a Chern band, and on a classical plasma analogy motivated by the vortexibility property of ideal Chern bands.</description>

      <title>Electron-electron interactions in partially mixed helical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the effect of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional partially mixed helical states. These helical states can be realized at the edges of two-dimensional topological insulators with partially broken time-reversal symmetry, resulting in helical gapped states. Using the bosonization method and renormalization group analysis, we identify weak gap, crossover, and strong gap regimes in the phase diagram. We find that strong electron-electron interaction mixes the helicity of the states, leading to the relevant strong gap regime. We investigate the charge and spin density wave correlation functions in different relevancy regimes of the gap mediated by interactions, where in the case of strong repulsive interaction, the spin density wave dominates the charge density wave. Additionally, employing the Memory function technique, we calculate the effect of mixed helicity on the charge transport in a sufficiently long edge. We find a non-uniform temperature dependence for the charge conductivity in both the strong and weak gap regimes with distinct features.</description>

      <title>Fixed-node errors in real space quantum Monte Carlo at high densities: closed-shell atomic correlation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-relativistic electron correlation energies of heavy noble gas atoms including the superheavy element Og. The corresponding data enables us to quantify fixed-node errors in real space quantum Monte Carlo methods as a function of the atomic number $Z$. We confirm that single-reference trial function nodes lead to an overall trend of mild decrease in recovered correlation energy with the increasing $Z$. This agrees with our previous study that has shown increasing fixed-node biases with the increasing electron density. We also estimate the value of the linear term in the asymptotic expansion of the atomic correlation energy.</description>

      <title>Geometric Excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of the intrinsic metric profoundly influence the neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall system, as established by Haldane in 2011 \cite{Haldane2011}, and further evidenced by a recent two-photon experiment \cite{Liang2024}. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic properties of these excitations, especially at long wavelengths, continues to elude interest. In this study, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate the neutral excitations of the Laughlin and Moore-Read states on an infinite cylinder. This investigation deepens our understanding of the excitation spectrum in regions where traditional methods do not work effectively. The spectral functions for both states reveal the presence of $S=-2$ geometric excitations. For the first time, we unveil the complex spectra of both neutral fermion and bosonic Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman modes within the excitation continuum by calculating the three-particle density response function for the Moore-Read state. Our findings support the hypothesis of emergent supersymmetry and highlight the potential for detecting neutral fermions in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties, magnetocaloric effect and magnetoresistance of EuAl3Si single crystal have been investigated. A giant reversible magnetocaloric effect was observed around TC = 14.5 K. For the low magnetic field changes of 0-2 T, the maximum values of magnetic entropy change and refrigerant capacity are 13.4 J/kg K, and 166 J/kg,respectively, with the corresponding adiabatic temperature of 7.2 K.These excellent magnetocaloric parameters suggest EuAl3Si as a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration application around liquid hydrogen temperature.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Electronic Structure in the Unconventional Charge-Ordered State of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome vanadates {\it A}V$_3$Sb$_5$ display unusual low-temperature electronic properties including charge density waves (CDW), whose microscopic origin remains unsettled. Recently, CDW order has been discovered in a new material ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, providing an opportunity to explore whether the onset of CDW leads to unusual electronic properties. Here, we study this question using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The ARPES measurements show minimal changes to the electronic structure after the onset of CDW. However, STM quasiparticle interference (QPI) measurements show strong dispersing features related to the CDW ordering vectors. A plausible explanation is the presence of a strong momentum-dependent scattering potential peaked at the CDW wavevector, associated with the existence of competing CDW instabilities. Our STM results further indicate that the bands most affected by the CDW are near vHS, analogous to the case of {\it A}V$_3$Sb$_5$ despite very different CDW wavevectors.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap with Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets in half-filled twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides are a new platform for realizing strongly correlated physics with high tunability. Recent transport experiments have reported the realization of a Mott insulator, its bandwidth-driven evolution to a metal, and the strange metal behavior in proximity to the transition via the tuning of a displacement field in twisted $\mathrm{WSe_2}$($\mathrm{tWSe_2}$) fixed at half filling. However, the nature of the correlated states and the related Mott physics involved in the whole process remain to be determined. Here, we unveil theoretically the evolution of the ground state of the half-filled $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}}$ Hubbard model as applied to $\mathrm{tWSe_2}$, transiting from a pseudogap state with Fermi arcs to a 120$^\circ$ Ne$\boldsymbol{\acute{\mathrm{e}}}$l ordered Mott insulator, then to another pseudogap state with Fermi pockets, and eventually to a Fermi liquid via a Lifshitz transition. The pseudogap phases are definitively identified by the vanishing of quasiparticle weights over an extended region of the free Fermi surface, with the remaining parts forming disconnected Fermi arcs or pockets that contain well-defined quasiparticles. The loss of quasiparticle weights in the pseudogap phases indicates the breakdown of Landau's Fermi liquid theory. We demonstrate that the emergence of the Fermi arcs/pockets results from the electronic structure reconstruction driven by strong electron correlations, marked by the existence of Luttinger surface enclosed by the zeros of single-particle Green's function. This work reveals the fundamental aspects of the Mottness in $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}}$ systems and will stimulate the advance of the direct probes of the Fermi surface and quasiparticles beyond transports, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the experimental evidence of a charge-$6e$ condensed phase in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{AV_3Sb_5}$ (J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)) has sparked significant interest. At a phenomenological level, the order parameter of the $3Q$ pair-density-wave state can form either a triangular lattice or a kagome lattice, in which the vortices and antivortices locate at the center of the plaquettes. When the phase of a Cooper pair is denoted as a XY spin, the effective model for the phase fluctuation is characterized by the frustrated XY spin model on a triangular lattice with the nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling or a kagome lattice with both nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. While both models produce $\frac{1}{3}$ fractional vortex excitations, which arise as the kinks on the domain walls in the low-energy excitations, the triangular lattice model has a much larger domain wall energy than the vortex interaction energy, so the frustrated kagome lattice model becomes unique. By developing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the presence of a vestigial phase with $\frac{1}{3}$ vortex-antivortex paired phase in the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magneto-resistant oscillations observed in the recent experimental work.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced pattern formations and melting of charge-density-wave order</title>

Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a photo-excited charge-density-wave (CDW) state in the square-lattice Holstein model, in a setup similar to a pump-probe experiment. At half-filling, the ground state of this system is characterized by a checkerboard modulation of particle densities, accompanied by a concomitant lattice distortion. An efficient real-space dynamics method integrating the von~Neumann equation for electron density matrix and Newton equation for classical lattice dynamics is developed to simulate the dynamical evolution of a photo-excited Holstein system. We find that the energy injected by a short pump pulse results in the reduction of the CDW order and the generation of coherent phonons. At strong photoexcitations, while the CDW order is melted in the sense that the time-averaged order parameter vanishes, a dynamical CDW state is self-sustained by the strong coherent phonon oscillations. Our large-scale simulations further uncover a dynamical regime of intermediate fluence where complex pattern formation is induced by the pump pulse. The emergent spatial textures are characterized by super density modulations on top of the short-range checkerboard CDW order. Our demonstration of pattern formation highlights the significance of dynamical inhomogeneity in quantum many-body systems in pump-probe experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in a non-magnetic metal interfaced to a canted antiferromagnetic insulator in perovskite oxide heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report interfacial transport properties in in-situ grown orthorhombic perovskite oxide heterostructures consisting of an antiferromagnetic insulator DyFeO$_3$ and a paramagnetic conductor CaRuO$_3$. We observe Hall effect with a step-like increase amounting to an effective magnetic field of 30 T at 20 K. We provide a plausible explanation in the context of topological Hall effect originating from a non-coplanar spin texture and resultant emergent field in DyFeO$_3$ associated with the scalar spin chirality. Our results demonstrate that the proximity effect of the emergent field at heterointerfaces is a universal physical phenomenon, while it has been reported originally in a heterointerface composed of pyrochlore oxides. This will greatly expand the choice of materials to the heterointerfaces for the research in emergent transport phenomena, which has been limited to single compounds with both metallic properties and special spin textures. Additionally, this will pave the way for possible device application of the emergent field by designing and combining perovskite oxides with versatile functionalities such as multiferroicity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Wigner phases in moir\'e superlattice from deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice designed in stacked van der Waals material provides a dynamic platform for hosting exotic and emergent condensed matter phenomena. However, the relevance of strong correlation effects and the large size of moir\'e unit cells pose significant challenges for traditional computational techniques. To overcome these challenges, we develop an unsupervised deep learning approach to uncover electronic phases emerging from moir\'e systems based on variational optimization of neural network many-body wavefunction. Our approach has identified diverse quantum states, including novel phases such as generalized Wigner crystals, Wigner molecular crystals, and previously unreported Wigner covalent crystals. These discoveries provide insights into recent experimental studies and suggest new phases for future exploration. They also highlight the crucial role of spin polarization in determining Wigner phases. More importantly, our proposed deep learning approach is proven general and efficient, offering a powerful framework for studying moir\'e physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes - the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code - both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tradeoff between trainability and expressibility is a central challenge faced by today's variational quantum computing. Recent studies indicate that resolving this dilemma necessitates designing specific parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to assess the learnability of PQCs regarding a given target. In this Letter, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it does not require actual training and can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding both physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable PQCs for a given problem without training, which can improve the efficiency of variational quantum computing especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

      <title>The fate of the spin polaron in the 1D antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01846v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of the spin polaron quasiparticle, well established in studies of a single hole in the 2D antiferromagnets, is investigated in the 1D antiferromagnets using a t-J model. We perform an exact slave fermion transformation to the holon-magnon basis, and diagonalize numerically the resulting model in the presence of a single hole. We demonstrate that the spin polaron collapses - and the spin-charge separation takes over - due to the specific role played by the magnon-magnon interactions and the magnon hard-core constraint in the 1D t-J model. Moreover, we prove that the spin polaron is stable for any strength of the magnon-magnon interaction other than the unique value found in a 1D antiferromagnet with the continuous symmetry of the spin interactions. Fine-tuning to this unique value is extremely unlikely to occur in quasi-1D antiferromagnets, therefore the spin polaron is the stable quasiparticle of realistic 1D materials. Our results lead to a new interpretation of the ARPES spectra of quasi-1D antiferromagnets in the spin polaron language.</description>

      <title>Boundary deconfined quantum criticality at transitions between symmetry-protected topological chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades of research have revealed a deep understanding of topological quantum matter with protected edge modes. We report that even richer physics emerges when tuning between two topological phases of matter whose respective edge modes are incompatible. The frustration at the edge leads to novel boundary physics, such as symmetry-breaking phases with exotic non-Landau transitions -- even when the edge is zero-dimensional. As a minimal case study we consider spin chains with $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, exhibiting two nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. At the bulk 1+1D critical transition between these SPT phases, we find two stable 0+1D boundary phases, each spontaneously breaking one of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetries. Furthermore, we find that a single boundary parameter tunes a non-Landau boundary critical transition between these two phases. This constitutes a 0+1D version of an exotic phenomenon driven by charged vortex condensation known as deconfined quantum criticality. This work highlights the rich unexplored physics of criticality between nontrivial topological phases and provides insights into the burgeoning field of gapless topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We studied the lock-in transition of charge-density waves of one-dimensional conductors. Though this phenomenon has been known for decades, there are still discrepancies between the theories and the experiments. We focused on the pioneering study of this phenomenon by McMillan and revisited, in particular, his numerical calculations. We first reproduced his results by providing unwritten information in the article. The obtained critical point was in good agreement with the previous study, as well as the analytical solution proposed later. We found a simple power-law behavior of the free energy in the critical regime, leading to the power-law divergence of the specific heat. We also introduced the concept of stiffness, equivalent to helicity modulus, which also showed a power-law behavior. These results allowed us to propose a new perspective on the lock-in transition.</description>

Abstract: Realizing topological orders and topological quantum computation is a central task of modern physics. An important but notoriously hard question in this endeavor is how to diagnose topological orders that lack conventional order parameters. A breakthrough in this problem is the discovery of topological entanglement entropy, which can be used to detect nontrivial topological order from a ground state wave function, but is far from enough for fully determining the topological order. In this work, we take a key step further in this direction: We propose a simple entanglement-based protocol for extracting the quantum dimensions of all anyons from a single ground state wave function in two dimensions. The choice of the space manifold and the ground state is arbitrary. This protocol is both validated in the continuum and verified on lattices, and we anticipate it to be realizable in various quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disorder operator is often designed to reveal the conformal field theory information in quantum many-body systems. By using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we study the scaling behavior of disorder operators on the boundary in the two-dimensional Heisenberg model on the square-octagon lattice with gapless topological edge state. In the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki phase, the disorder operator is shown to hold the perimeter scaling with a logarithmic term associated with the Luttinger liquid parameter K. This effective Luttinger liquid parameter K reflects the low-energy physics and CFT for (1+1)D boundary. At bulk critical point, the effective K is suppressed but keeps finite value, indicating the coupling between the gapless edge state and bulk fluctuation. The logarithmic term numerically captures this coupling picture, which reveals the (1+1)D SU(2)1 CFT and (2+1)D O(3) CFT at boundary criticality. Our Letter paves a new way to study the exotic boundary state and boundary criticality.</description>

Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

Abstract: We propose a topological probe for detecting chirality imbalance in time reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals via nonlinear Hall response. The chiral anomaly effect, occurring in parallel electric and magnetic fields, causes an energy shift between Weyl cones of different chirality, which leads to chirally asymmetric intra-node relaxation. The net nonlinear Hall current is thus quantized, and determined by the sum of monopole charge weighted by the transport relaxation time. Our theory directly applies to chiral Weyl semimetals even without a magnetic field. Additionally, besides DC transport probes, we anticipate that nonlinear circular dichroism measurements could detect chiral asymmetry-induced currents.</description>

Abstract: Employing the projective formalism of determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we meticulously explore the ground-state phase diagram and critical behavior of the half-filled Hubbard model on a square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. This lattice, a two-dimensional (2D) structure comprising squares, hexagons, and octagons, is representative of the biphenylene network (BPN). Our findings reveal an intriguing ground-state phase diagram, featuring an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating phase enveloped by three valence-bond solid-like (VBS-like) insulating phases. Analyzing the single-particle gap, spin gap, and single-particle spectral function, we observe that the metallic state in the noninteracting case becomes unstable under the influence of Hubbard U. This interaction drives the system into a hexagon insulating phase before transitioning into an AFM Mott insulating phase. To quantify the critical exponents, we use finite-size scaling techniques. The critical exponents of quantum critical points between the AFM Mott insulating phase and two insulating phases, plaquette insulator and ethylene insulator, closely align with the 3D O(3) universality class. However, the critical exponents of quantum critical points between the hexagon insulating phase and the AFM Mott insulating phase deviate from the 3D O(3) universality class. This deviation is a finite-size effect and can be attributed to the coupling between the fluctuations of magnetic order parameter and very low-energy fermionic excitations. Our comprehensive study not only advances the understanding of correlation effects on the SHO lattice but also sheds light on the less-explored critical exponents in weakly insulating quantum critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic excitations of the trimerized Heisenberg models with intra-trimer interaction $J_1$ and inter-trimer interaction $J_2$ on four different two-dimensional lattices using a combination of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation methods (SAC), complemented by cluster perturbation theory (CPT). These models exhibit quasi-particle-like excitations when $g=J_2/J_1$ is small, characterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and high-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic ground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of the effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and quartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with distinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbation theory when the ratio of exchange interactions $g$ is small. In this small $g$ regime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy spectra. However, as $g$ increases, these three spectra gradually merge into the magnon modes or continua. Nevertheless, the LSWT fails to provide quantitative descriptions of the higher-energy excitation bands due to significant quantum fluctuations. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized hexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum, originating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between chains. Our numerical analysis of these 2D trimers yields valuable theoretical predictions and explanations for the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra of 2D magnetic materials featuring trimerized lattices.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Effective Quantum Impurity Models</title>

Abstract: Generalized quantum impurity models -- which feature a few localized and strongly-correlated degrees of freedom coupled to itinerant conduction electrons -- describe diverse physical systems, from magnetic moments in metals to nanoelectronics quantum devices such as quantum dots or single-molecule transistors. Correlated materials can also be understood as self-consistent impurity models through dynamical mean field theory. Accurate simulation of such models is challenging, especially at low temperatures, due to many-body effects from electronic interactions, resulting in strong renormalization. In particular, the interplay between local impurity complexity and Kondo physics is highly nontrivial. A common approach, which we further develop in this work, is to consider instead a simpler effective impurity model that still captures the low-energy physics of interest. The mapping from bare to effective model is typically done perturbatively, but even this can be difficult for complex systems, and the resulting effective model parameters can anyway be quite inaccurate. Here we develop a non-perturbative, unsupervised machine learning approach to systematically obtain low-energy effective impurity-type models, based on the renormalization group framework. The method is shown to be general and flexible, as well as accurate and systematically improvable. We benchmark the method against exact results for the Anderson impurity model, and provide an outlook for more complex models beyond the reach of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Room temperature charge density wave in a tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5 and study of its origin in the RE2T3X5 (RE = Rare earth, T = transition metal, X = Si, Ge) series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) systems are proposed to exhibit application potential for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials that exhibit a CDW state at room temperature is crucial for the development of CDW-based devices. Here, we present a non-layered tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5, which exhibits a CDW state at room temperature. Gd2Os3Si5 crystallizes in the U2Mn3Si5-type tetragonal crystal structure with the space group P4/mnc. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis shows that Gd2Os3Si5 possesses an incommensurately modulated structure with modulation wave vector q = (0.53, 0, 0), while the modulation reduces the symmetry to orthorhombic Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0. This differs in contrast to isostructural Sm2Ru3Ge5, where the modulated phase has been reported to possess the superspace symmetry Pm({\alpha} 0 {\gamma})0. However, reinvestigation of Sm2Ru3Ge5 suggests that its modulated crystal structure can alternatively be described by Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0, with modulations similar to Gd2Os3Si5. The magnetic susceptibility, \c{hi}(T), exhibits a maximum at low temperatures that indicates an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 5.5 K. The \c{hi}(T) furthermore shows an anomaly at around 345 K, suggesting a CDW transition at TCDW = 345 K, that corroborates the result from high-temperature SXRD measurements. Interestingly, R2T3X5 compounds are known to crystallize either in the tetragonal Sc2Fe3Si5 type structure or in the orthorhombic U2Co3Si5 structure type. Not all of the compounds in the R2T3X5 series undergo CDW phase transitions. We find that R2T3X5 compounds will exhibit a CDW transition, if the condition : 0.526 &lt; c/sqrt(ab) &lt; 0.543 is satisfied. We suggest the wave vector-dependent electron-phonon coupling to be the dominant mechanism of CDW formation in the tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin-$S$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice for $S\!=\!1/2$, $1$ and $3/2$, by using the coupled cluster method (CCM) of microscopic quantum many-body theory. This system is one of the earliest extensions of the Kitaev model and is believed to contain two extended spin liquid phases for any value of the spin quantum number $S$. We show that the CCM delivers accurate estimates for the phase boundaries of these spin liquid phases, as well as other transition points in the phase diagram. Moreover, we find evidence of two unexpected narrow phases for $S\!=\!1/2$, one sandwiched between the zigzag and ferromagnetic phases and the other between the N\'eel and the stripy phases. The results establish the CCM as a versatile numerical technique that can capture the strong quantum-mechanical fluctuations that are inherently present in generalized Kitaev models with competing bond-dependent anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Zeno crossover in the dynamics of a monitored quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath and subject to continuous monitoring of its charge density. The dynamics averaged over measurement noise is described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model with local Markovian dephasing, that we solve using an extension of the Non-Crossing Approximation in the vectorized Hilbert space. We show that the decay time scale of an initially polarised spin which is suddenly coupled to the bath and to the monitoring protocol displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a lifetime controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a lifetime which decreases with bare dissipation as the dephasing or monitoring rate is increased. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the Lindbladian we derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described at weak dissipation by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin-spin exchange. As the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Charge ordered phases in the hole-doped triangular Mott insulator 4Hb-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS2 has been proposed to possess unconventional superconductivity with broken time reveral symmetry due to distinctive layered structure, featuring a heterojunction between a 2D triangular Mott insulator and a charge density wave metal. However, since a frustrated spin state in the correlated insulating layer is susceptible to charge ordering with carrier doping, it is required to investigate the charge distribution driven by inter-layer charge transfer to understand its superconductivity. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) to investigate the charge ordered phases of 1T-TaS2 layers within 4Hb-TaS2, explicitly focusing on the non-half-filled regime. Our STS results show an energy gap which exhibits an out-of-phase relation with the charge density. We ascribe the competition between on-site and nonlocal Coulomb repulsion as the driving force for the charge-ordered insulating phase of a doped triangular Mott insulator. In addition, we discuss the role of the insulating layer in the enhanced superconductivity of 4Hb-TaS2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the teleportation and superdense coding protocols for a family of anyon theories coming from Tambara-Yamagami categories, of which the lowest rank theories describe Ising anyons. In contrast to the usual approach to anyonic computation, we relax the requirement that we should be able to braid anyons. This is motivated by the goal of designing basic protocols that require less control over quasiparticles, and which may therefore be amenable to realisation in near-term systems. Since these implementations are braid-free, they are also compatible with Majorana modes on a 1d quantum wire.</description>

      <title>Group-theoretic error mitigation enabled by classical shadows and symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values is a key subroutine in quantum algorithms. Near-term implementations face two major challenges: a limited number of samples required to learn a large collection of observables, and the accumulation of errors in devices without quantum error correction. To address these challenges simultaneously, we develop a quantum error-mitigation strategy called ``symmetry-adjusted classical shadows,'' by adjusting classical-shadow tomography according to how symmetries are corrupted by device errors. As a concrete example, we highlight global $\mathrm{U(1)}$ symmetry, which manifests in fermions as particle number and in spins as total magnetization, and illustrate their group-theoretic unification with respective classical-shadow protocols. We establish rigorous sampling bounds under readout errors obeying minimal assumptions, and perform numerical experiments with a more comprehensive model of gate-level errors derived from existing quantum processors. Our results reveal symmetry-adjusted classical shadows as a low-cost strategy to mitigate errors from noisy quantum experiments in the ubiquitous presence of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-Localized Response in Quantum Critical Spin Systems: Insights from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain quantum many-body systems in $d$-dimensions are equivalent to gravitational theories in $(d+1)$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes. When a massless particle is sent from the AdS boundary to the bulk curved spacetime, it reaches another point of the boundary after a time lag. In the dual quantum system, it should appear as if quasiparticles have been transferred between two separated points. We theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon, which we call "spacetime-localized response," is actually observed in the dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model near the quantum critical point. This result suggests that, if we can realize a holographic spin system in a laboratory, the experimental probing of the emergent extra-dimension is possible by applying a designed stimulus to a quantum many-body system, which is holographically equivalent to sending a massless particle through the higher-dimensional curved bulk geometry. We also discuss possible experimental realizations using Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezers array.</description>

Abstract: A modern cold triple-axis spectrometer to study quantum condensed matter systems is planned for the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Here, we describe the conceptual principles and design of a secondary spectrometer using a multiplexed, prismatic analyzer system relying on graphite crystals and inspired by the successful implementation of the Continuous Angle Multiple Energy Analysis (CAMEA) spectrometers at the Paul Scherrer Institute. This project is currently known as MANTA for Multi-analyzer Neutron Triple-Axis. We report Monte-Carlo ray-tracing simulations on a simple but realistic sample scattering kernel to further illustrate the prismatic analyzer concept's workings, calibration, and performance. Then, we introduce a new statistical analysis approach based on the prismatic analyzer concept to improve the number of final energies measured on the spectrometer. We also study possible evolutions in the CAMEA design relevant for MANTA.</description>

Abstract: Kibble-Zurek mechanism relates the domain of non-equilibrium dynamics with the critical properties at equilibrium. It establishes a power law connection between non-equilibrium defects quenched through a continuous phase transition and the quench rate via the scaling exponent. We present a novel numerical scheme to estimate the scaling exponent wherein the notion of defects is mapped to errors, previously introduced to quantify a variety of gapped quantum phases. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we conduct numerical experiments across a broad spectrum of spin-half models hosting local and symmetry protected topological order. Furthermore, an implementation of the quench dynamics featuring a topological phase transition on a digital quantum computer is proposed to quantify the associated criticality.</description>

Abstract: The group of moir\'e graphene superconductors keeps growing, and by now it contains twisted graphene multilayers and twisted double bilayers. We analyze the contribution of long range charge fluctuations in the superconductivity of twisted double graphene bilayers and helical trilayers, and compare the results to twisted bilayer graphene. We apply a diagrammatic approach which depends on a few, well known parameters. We find that the critical temperature and the order parameter differ significantly between twisted double bilayers and helical trilayers on one hand, and twisted bilayer graphene on the other. We show that this trend, consistent with experiments, can be associated to the role played by moir\'e Umklapp processes in the different systems.</description>

Abstract: The topological phase transition in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model is studied using a real-space approach. An effective Hamiltonian for the topologically protected edge-modes in a finite-size system is developed. The topological phase transition is understood in terms of a global perturbation to the system which lifts the degeneracy of the edge-modes. The effective Hamiltonian method is also applied to a one-dimensional system with spatially varying hopping strengths to understand the impact of disorder on the edge-modes.</description>

Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

Abstract: The properties of functional oxide heterostructures are strongly influenced by the physics governing their interfaces. Modern deposition techniques allow us to accurately engineer the interface physics through the growth of atomically precise heterostructures. This enables minute control over the electronic, magnetic, and structural characteristics. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of tailor-made superlattices employing the ferromagnetic and insulating double perovskites RE$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (RE = La, Nd), featuring distinct Curie temperatures. Adjusting the superlattice periodicity at the unit cell level allows us to engineer their magnetic phase diagram. Large periodicity superlattices conserve the individual para- to ferromagnetic transitions of the La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ parent compounds. As the superlattice periodicity is reduced, the Curie temperatures of the superlattice constituents converge and, finally, collapse into one single transition for the lowest period samples. This is a consequence of the magnetic order parameter propagating across the superlattice interfaces, as supported by a minimal Landau theory model. Further, we find that the Nd-Ni/Mn exchange interaction can be enhanced by the superlattice interfaces. This leads to a field-induced reversal of the Nd magnetic moments, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements and supported by first-principles calculations. Our work demonstrates how superlattice engineering can be employed to fine-tune the magnetic properties in oxide heterostructures and broadens our understanding of magnetic interfacial effects.</description>
