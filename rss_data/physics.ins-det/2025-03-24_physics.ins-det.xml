      <title>Performance of neutron and proton irradiated AC-LGAD sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of strip and pixel AC-LGAD devices with both laser TCT and probe station (IV/CV) will be shown on AC-LGADs irradiated with 1 MeV reactor neutrons at JSI/Ljubljana and with 400~MeV protons at FNAL ITA to fluences from 1e13~$n_{eq}/cm^2$ to a few times 1e15~$n_{eq}/cm^2$. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R\&amp;D program at the EIC, which will feature AC-LGADs with strip and pixel geometry. Sensors in the TOF layer will receive up to 1e13~$n_{eq}/cm^2$ fluence over the lifetime of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Measurements on Time Resolution of BGO, PWO and BSO Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-granularity crystal calorimeter (HGCCAL) has been proposed for the future Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). This study investigates the time resolution of various crystal - Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) detection units for HGCCAL, focusing on Bismuth Germanate (BGO), Lead Tungstate (PWO), and Bismuth Silicon Oxide (BSO) crystals. Beam tests were conducted using 10 GeV pions at CERN and 5 GeV electrons at DESY, enabling systematic comparisons of timing performance under both minimum ionizing particle (MIP) signals and electromagnetic (EM) showers. Three timing methods - constant fraction timing (CFT) with sampled points, linear fitting, and exponential fitting - were evaluated, with an exponential fit combined with a 10% constant fraction providing the best time resolution. Measurements of crystal units with different dimensions revealed that both scintillation light yield and signal rise time influence timing performance. Among similarly sized crystals, PWO exhibited the best time resolution due to its fast signal rise time, while BGO and BSO demonstrated comparable timing performance. For long BGO bars (40 cm and 60 cm), the time resolution remained uniform along their length, achieving approximately 0.75 ns and 0.95 ns for MIP signals. Under intense EM showers, both bars reached a timing resolution of approximately 200 ps at high amplitudes. And the presence of upstream pre-shower layers can introduce additional timing fluctuations at similar amplitudes.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Alignment Techniques for Realizing an Ultracompact Electromagnetic Calorimeters Using Oriented high-Z Scintillator Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic calorimeters used in high-energy physics and astrophysics rely heavily on high-Z inorganic scintillators, such as lead tungstate (PbWO4 or PWO). The crystalline structure and lattice orientation of inorganic scintillators are frequently underestimated in detector design, even though it is known that the crystalline lattice strongly modifies the features of the electromagnetic processes inside the crystal. A novel method has been developed for precisely bonding PWO crystals with aligned atomic planes within 100 {\mu}rad, exploiting X-ray diffraction (XRD) to accurately measure miscut angles. This method demonstrates the possibility to align a layer of crystals along the same crystallographic direction, opening a new technological path towards the development of next-generation electromagnetic calorimeters.</description>

      <title>Developing a Network Discovery Protocol for the Constellation Control and Data Acquisition Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualifying new detectors in test beam environments presents a challenging setting that requires stable operation of diverse devices, often employing multiple data acquisition systems. Changes to these setups are frequent, such as using different reference detectors depending on the facility. Managing this complexity necessitates a system capable of controlling the data taking, monitoring the experimental setup, facilitating seamless configuration, and easy integration of new devices. One aspect of such systems is network configuration. Many systems require fixed IP addresses for all machines participating in the data acquisition, which adds complexity for users. In this paper, a network protocol for network discovery tailored towards network-distributed control and data acquisition systems is described.</description>

      <title>Performance of the ALICE Inner Tracking System 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upgraded Inner Tracking System (ITS2) of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider is based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). With a sensitive area of about 10 $m^2$ and 12.5 billion pixels, ITS2 represents the largest pixel detector in high-energy physics. The detector consists of seven concentric layers equipped with ALPIDE pixel sensors manufactured in the TowerJazz 180 nm CMOS Imaging Sensor process. The high spatial resolution and low material budget, in combination with small radial distance of the innermost layer from the interaction point, make the detector well suited for secondary vertex reconstruction as well as for tracking at low transverse momentum.
  This paper will present the detector performance during the LHC Run 3 and give an overview on the calibration methods and running experience.</description>

      <title>ATLAS Micromegas Performance Studies with LHC Run3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After successfully completing Phase I upgrades during LHC Long Shutdown 2, the ATLAS detector is back in operation with several upgrades implemented. The most important and challenging upgrade is in the Muon Spectrometer, where the two inner forward muon stations have been replaced with the New Small Wheels (NSW) system. One of the two detector technologies used in the NSW are the resistive Micromegas (MM). After massive construction, testing and installation work in ATLAS, the Micromegas are now fully operational in the experiment participating in the muon spectrometer tracking and trigger systems. A huge effort has gone into the operation of the new data acquisition system, as well as the implementation of a new processing chain within the muon software framework. Tracking is performed with full consideration of the absolute alignment of each individual detector module by the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer optical alignment system. All the deviations from the nominal geometry of all the constituent elements of each MM module are accounted for through the modelling of the real chamber geometry reconstructed from the information of the construction databases. After an overview of the strategies adopted for the simulations and reconstruction, the studies on the performance of the MM in LHC run-3 data taken from 2022 to 2024 will be reported.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet Time-Resolved Photoelectron Spectrometer with an Ultrathin Liquid Flat Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A setup for extreme-ultraviolet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (XUV-TRPES) of liquids is described based on a gas-dynamic flat jet formed by a microfluidic chip device. In comparison to a cylindrical jet that has a typical diameter of 10-30 micrometers, the larger surface area of the flat jet with a width of ca. 300 micrometers allows for full overlap of the target with the pump and probe light beams. This results in an enhancement of photoelectrons emitted from the liquid, while simultaneously allowing smaller sample consumption compared with other flat jet techniques utilizing liquid collisions or converging slits. Femtosecond pulses of XUV light at a photon energy of 21.7 eV are prepared by high harmonic generation and a multilayer mirror that selects a single harmonic; the He gas used to form the gas-dynamic flat jet is transparent at this energy. Compared to a cylindrical jet, the photoelectron signal from the liquid is enhanced relative to that from the surrounding vapor jacket. Pump-probe spectra for aqueous thymine show notably higher signals for the flat vs cylindrical jet. Moreover, the time-dependent space-charge shift in UV pump/XUV probe experiments is smaller for the gas dynamic flat jet than for a cylindrical jet with the same flow rate, an effect that is accentuated at higher He backing pressures that yield a thinner jet. This reflects reduced multiphoton ionization of the solute by the UV pump pulse, the primary cause of the space charge shift, as the jet becomes thinner and reaches the thickness of a few tens of nm.</description>

      <title>Jitter in photon-number-resolved detection by superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the physics of multi-photon absorption in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), we identify physical components of jitter. From this, we formulate a quantitative physical model of the multi-photon detector response which combines local detection mechanism and local fluctuations (hotspot formation and intrinsic jitter) with thermoelectric dynamics of resistive domains. Our model provides an excellent description of the arrival-time histogram of a commercial SNSPD across several orders of magnitude, both in arrival-time probability and across mean photon number. This is achieved with just three fitting parameters: the scaling of the mean arrival time of voltage response pulses, as well as the Gaussian and exponential jitter components. Our findings have important implications for photon-number-resolving detector design, as well as applications requiring low jitter such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR).</description>

      <title>High-energy chirped nanosecond pulsed laser system for particle diagnostics and manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upgraded high-energy nanosecond pulsed laser system tailored for optical particle diagnostics and manipulation capable of pulse energies beyond Joule-level is presented. In addition to the notable output energy increase, the laser system maintains its capability to generate laser pulses with customizable temporal profiles and variable durations ($1$ ns to $1$ $\mu$s) along with a chirping range of several GHz over the pulse duration. The expanded output energy range is anticipated to greatly broaden the laser system's application potential, both for thermodynamic diagnostics via coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering, by substantially lowering the particle density detection thresholds, as well as for particle manipulation, by facilitating more efficient optical trapping potentials for particle acceleration and deceleration.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of commercially available solders for low-field applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solders with superconducting properties around $4\,{\rm K}$ are useful in low magnetic field environments for AC current leads or in electrical and mechanical bonds. Accurate knowledge of these properties are needed in high precision experiments. We have measured the electrical resistance of five commercially-available solders: 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb, 52\%In-48\%Sn, and 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag, down to $2.3\,{\rm K}$ and in applied magnetic fields from 0 to 0.1$\,{\rm T}$. Their critical temperatures $T_c$ and critical fields $B_c$ were extracted in our analysis, taking into account the observed 90\%-to-10\% transition widths. Our best candidate for low-loss AC current leads in low fields is 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, which had zero-field $T_{c,0} = (7.1 \pm 0.3)\,{\rm K}$, and remained high to $T_c(B=0.1\,{\rm T}) = (6.9 \pm 0.3) \,{\rm K}$. We report $T_c$ and $B_c$ of 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb and $B_{c,0}$ of 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag for the first time. Our $T_{c,0}= (3.31 \pm 0.04)\,{\rm K}$ for 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag disagrees with a widely adopted value.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Calorimetric Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is proposed. In the conventional Geiger mode, the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below TC and displays calorimetric sensitivity in the range of 15 to 250 absorbed-photon energy equivalent for a photon beam with a wavelength of 515 nm. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 560 ps. Dual-mode SNSPDs may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</description>

      <title>Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-free scattering of atomic nuclei away from the stability line has reached several milestones over the past decade. The advent of gamma, charged-particle, and neutron detection devices for inverse kinematics, especially in combination with RI beams, has opened new horizons in nuclear physics. Research is progressing with detection devices optimized to explore these new and challenging areas of physics. While some of the new detection developments aim for high energy and angular resolution, others focus on increasing detection efficiency or enhancing large angular acceptance. Notable new detection systems such as STRASSE, TOGAXI, HYPATIA, NEBULA(plus), and TRIP have been developed at the RIBF to meet these demands. As high-intensity RI beams become available worldwide, we reflect on past detectors and provide a review of the future development of detection devices.</description>

      <title>Energy Response and Resolution to Positrons in a Capillary-Tube Dual-Readout Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a test beam campaign on a capillary-tube fibre-based dual-readout calorimeter, designed for precise hadronic and electromagnetic energy measurements in future collider experiments. The calorimeter prototype consists of nine modules, each composed of brass capillary tubes housing scintillating and Cherenkov optical fibres, read out using silicon photomultipliers for the central module and photomultiplier tubes for the outer modules. The performance of the detector was assessed using a positron beam with energies ranging from 10 to 120 GeV at the CERN SPS H8 beamline. The prototype is characterised in terms of the linearity and resolution of its energy response to positrons. The results confirm the feasibility of the capillary-tube mechanical design for large-scale dual-readout calorimetry and provide a benchmark for future detector development within the HiDRa project.</description>

Abstract: The Apollo Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) platform is an open-source design consisting of a generic "Service Module" (SM) and a customizable "Command Module" (CM), allowing for cost-effective use in applications such as the readout of the inner tracker and the Level-1 track trigger for the CMS Phase-II upgrade at the HL-LHC. The SM integrates an intelligent IPMC, robust power entry and conditioning systems, a powerful system-on-module computer, and flexible clock and communication infrastructure. The CM is designed around two Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs and high-density, high-bandwidth optical transceivers capable of 25 Gb/s. Crates of Apollo blades are currently being tested at Boston University, Cornell University, and CERN.</description>
