      <title>The Genomic Landscape of Oceania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encompassing regions that were amongst the first inhabited by humans following the out-of-Africa expansion, hosting populations with the highest levels of archaic hominid introgression, and including Pacific islands that are the most isolated inhabited locations on the planet, Oceania has a rich, but understudied, human genomic landscape. Here we describe the first region-wide analysis of genome-wide data from population groups spanning Oceania and its surroundings, from island and peninsular southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea, east across the Pacific through Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, and west across the Indian Ocean to related island populations in the Andamans and Madagascar. In total we generate and analyze genome-wide data from 981 individuals from 92 different populations, 58 separate islands, and 30 countries, representing the most expansive study of Pacific genetics to date. In each sample we disentangle the Papuan and more recent Austronesian ancestries, which have admixed in various proportions across this region, using ancestry-specific analyses, and characterize the distinct patterns of settlement, migration, and archaic introgression separately in these two ancestries. We also focus on the patterns of clinically relevant genetic variation across Oceania--a landscape rippled with strong founder effects and island-specific genetic drift in allele frequencies--providing an atlas for the development of precision genetic health strategies in this understudied region of the world.</description>

      <title>Leveraging graphical model techniques to study evolution on phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular and phenotypic traits is commonly modelled using Markov processes along a rooted phylogeny. This phylogeny can be a tree, or a network if it includes reticulations, representing events such as hybridization or admixture. Computing the likelihood of data observed at the leaves is costly as the size and complexity of the phylogeny grows. Efficient algorithms exist for trees, but cannot be applied to networks. We show that a vast array of models for trait evolution along phylogenetic networks can be reformulated as graphical models, for which efficient belief propagation algorithms exist. We provide a brief review of belief propagation on general graphical models, then focus on linear Gaussian models for continuous traits. We show how belief propagation techniques can be applied for exact or approximate (but more scalable) likelihood and gradient calculations, and prove novel results for efficient parameter inference of some models. We highlight the possible fruitful interactions between graphical models and phylogenetic methods. For example, approximate likelihood approaches have the potential to greatly reduce computational costs for phylogenies with reticulations.</description>

      <title>Phylotrack: C++ and Python libraries for in silico phylogenetic tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silico evolution instantiates the processes of heredity, variation, and differential reproductive success (the three "ingredients" for evolution by natural selection) within digital populations of computational agents. Consequently, these populations undergo evolution, and can be used as virtual model systems for studying evolutionary dynamics. This experimental paradigm -- used across biological modeling, artificial life, and evolutionary computation -- complements research done using in vitro and in vivo systems by enabling experiments that would be impossible in the lab or field. One key benefit is complete, exact observability. For example, it is possible to perfectly record all parent-child relationships across simulation history, yielding complete phylogenies (ancestry trees). This information reveals when traits were gained or lost, and also facilitates inference of underlying evolutionary dynamics.
  The Phylotrack project provides libraries for tracking and analyzing phylogenies in in silico evolution. The project is composed of 1) Phylotracklib: a header-only C++ library, developed under the umbrella of the Empirical project, and 2) Phylotrackpy: a Python wrapper around Phylotracklib, created with Pybind11. Both components supply a public-facing API to attach phylogenetic tracking to digital evolution systems, as well as a stand-alone interface for measuring a variety of popular phylogenetic topology metrics. Underlying design and C++ implementation prioritizes efficiency, allowing for fast generational turnover for agent populations numbering in the tens of thousands. Several explicit features (e.g., phylogeny pruning and abstraction, etc.) are provided for reducing the memory footprint of phylogenetic information.</description>
