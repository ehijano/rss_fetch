      <title>Generative Diffusion Model-based Compression of MIMO CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While neural lossy compression techniques have markedly advanced the efficiency of Channel State Information (CSI) compression and reconstruction for feedback in MIMO communications, efficient algorithms for more challenging and practical tasks-such as CSI compression for future channel prediction and reconstruction with relevant side information-remain underexplored, often resulting in suboptimal performance when existing methods are extended to these scenarios. To that end, we propose a novel framework for compression with side information, featuring an encoding process with fixed-rate compression using a trainable codebook for codeword quantization, and a decoding procedure modeled as a backward diffusion process conditioned on both the codeword and the side information. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing CSI compression algorithms, often yielding over twofold performance improvement by achieving comparable distortion at less than half the data rate of competing methods in certain scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based compression for practical deployment in communication systems.</description>

      <title>On Phi-entropic Dependence Measures and Non-local Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a measure of dependence between two random variables $X$ and $Y$, denoted as $\rho(X;Y)$, satisfies the data processing property if $\rho(X;Y)\geq \rho(X';Y')$ for every $X'\rightarrow X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Y'$, and satisfies the tensorization property if $\rho(X_1X_2;Y_1Y_2)=\max\{\rho(X_1;Y_1),\rho(X_2;Y_2)\}$ when $(X_1,Y_1)$ is independent of $(X_2,Y_2)$. It is known that measures of dependence defined based on $\Phi$-entropy satisfy these properties. These measures are important because they generalize R{\'e}nyi's maximal correlation and the hypercontractivity ribbon. The data processing and tensorization properties are special cases of monotonicity under wirings of non-local boxes. We show that ribbons defined using $\Phi$-entropic measures of dependence are monotone under wiring of non-local no-signaling boxes, generalizing an earlier result. In addition, we also discuss the evaluation of $\Phi$-strong data processing inequality constant for joint distributions obtained from a $Z$-channel.</description>

      <title>Information entropy of complex probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability theory is fundamental for modeling uncertainty, with traditional probabilities being real and non-negative. Complex probability extends this concept by allowing complex-valued probabilities, opening new avenues for analysis in various fields. This paper explores the information-theoretic aspects of complex probability, focusing on its definition, properties, and applications. We extend Shannon entropy to complex probability and examine key properties, including maximum entropy, joint entropy, conditional entropy, equilibration, and cross entropy. These results offer a framework for understanding entropy in complex probability spaces and have potential applications in fields such as statistical mechanics and information theory.</description>

      <title>Disproving some theorems in Sharma and Chauhan et al. (2018, 2021)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to show, through counterexamples, that some of the theorems presented in the papers of Sharma \textit{et al.} (2018) and Chauhan \textit{et al.} ( 2021) are incorrect. Although they used these theorems to establish a sufficient condition for a multi-twisted (MT) code to be linear complementary dual (LCD), we show that this condition itself remains valid. We further improve this condition by removing the restrictions on the shift constants and relaxing the required coprimality condition. We show that compared to the previous condition, the modified condition is able to identify more LCD MT codes. Furthermore, without the need for a normalized set of generators, we develop a formula to determine the dimension of any $\rho$-generator MT code.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for ISAC Systems with Suppressed Range-Angle Sidelobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a pivotal advancement for future wireless networks. This paper introduces a novel ISAC beamforming method for enhancing sensing performance while preserving communication quality by leveraging the ambiguity function (AF). We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the AF subject to the constraints of transmission power, communication signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio, and sensing gain. To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, semidefinite relaxation is adopted. Numerical results show that our method significantly reduces range sidelobes and achieves a lower ISLR in the rangeangle domain compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Stable recovery guarantees for blind deconvolution under random mask assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the blind deconvolution problem with modulated inputs, focusing on a measurement model where an unknown blurring kernel $\boldsymbol{h}$ is convolved with multiple random modulations $\{\boldsymbol{d}_l\}_{l=1}^{L}$(coded masks) of a signal $\boldsymbol{x}$, subject to $\ell_2$-bounded noise. We introduce a more generalized framework for coded masks, enhancing the versatility of our approach. Our work begins within a constrained least squares framework, where we establish a robust recovery bound for both $\boldsymbol{h}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$, demonstrating its near-optimality up to a logarithmic factor. Additionally, we present a new recovery scheme that leverages sparsity constraints on $\boldsymbol{x}$. This approach significantly reduces the sampling complexity to the order of $L=O(\log n)$ when the non-zero elements of $\boldsymbol{x}$ are sufficiently separated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating sparsity constraints yields a refined error bound compared to the traditional constrained least squares model. The proposed method results in more robust and precise signal recovery, as evidenced by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. These findings contribute to advancing the field of blind deconvolution and offer potential improvements in various applications requiring signal reconstruction from modulated inputs.</description>

      <title>Inequalities Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past over two decades, very fruitful results have been obtained in information theory in the study of the Shannon entropy. This study has led to the discovery of a new class of constraints on the Shannon entropy called non-Shannon-type inequalities. Intimate connections between the Shannon entropy and different branches of mathematics including group theory, combinatorics, Kolmogorov complexity, probability, matrix theory, etc, have been established. All these discoveries were based on a formality introduced for constraints on the Shannon entropy, which suggested the possible existence of constraints that were not previously known. We assert that the same formality can be applied to inequalities beyond information theory. To illustrate the ideas, we revisit through the lens of this formality three fundamental inequalities in mathematics: the AM-GM inequality in algebra, Markov's inequality in probability theory, and the Cauchy-Scharwz inequality for inner product spaces. Applications of this formality have the potential of leading to the discovery of new inequalities and constraints in different branches of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology for future wireless networks, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) through the dynamic configuration of antennas in response to propagation environment variations. The integration of fluid antennas (FAs) with multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks promises substantial weighted sum rate (WSR) gains via joint beamforming and FA position optimization. However, the joint design is challenging due to the strong coupling between beamforming matrices and antenna positions. To address the challenge, we propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method in FA-assisted MU-MIMO networks. Specifically, we first employ matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we solve the reformulated problem following the BCA principle, where we develop a low-complexity majorization maximization algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simultaneously. To further reduce the computational, storage, and interconnection costs, we propose a decentralized implementation for our proposed algorithm by utilizing the decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that with our proposed algorithm, the FA-assisted MU-MIMO system achieves up to a 47% WSR improvement over conventional MIMO networks equipped with fixed-position antennas. Moreover, the decentralized implementation reduces computation time by approximately 70% and has similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an overview of various kinds of interference, that arise in the Orthogonal Frequency-Domain Multiplexing (OFDM)-based digital communications systems at the physical layer. Inter-symbol, inter-block, inter-carrier interference types are described in detail, valid for any OFDM transmission, along with Inter-cell interference specific to cellular networks. A survey of various communication disruptions techniques is presented - primarily focusing on intentional interference - jamming. Furthermore, we present a survey of modulation techniques that expand on the OFDM and may be considered viable candidates for modulation in the future 6G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Families of Polycyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equivalence of families of polycyclic codes associated with polynomials of the form $x^n - a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \ldots - a_1x - a_0$ over a finite field. We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial $x^n - a_{\ell} x^{\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0&lt; \ell &lt;n$), which we refer to as \textit{$\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our results to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation called \textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of $n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number of $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\ell)}$, for this relation and provide conditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\ell$-trinomial) codes are equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\gcd(n, n-\ell) = 1$, any $\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family associated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on $p^{\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples as an application of the theory developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly nontrivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Intelligent Sensing: A Source-Channel Tradeoff and Its Application to Coding Rate Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is set to merge edge artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) extensively, giving rise to the new paradigm of edge intelligent sensing (EI-Sense). This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.</description>

      <title>Group Sparsity Methods for Compressive Space-Frequency Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid Antenna System (FAS) unlocks unprecedented flexibility in wireless channel optimization through spatial reconfigurability. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm.
  Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <title>Approximate Evaluation Method for the Probability of the Union of Independent Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of the probability of union of a large number of independent events requires several combinations involving the factorial and the use of high performance computers with several hours of processing. Bounds and simplifications on the probability of the union are useful in the analysis of stochastic problems across various areas including (but not limited to) systems reliability, biological systems, real-time fault-tolerant systems, probability theory, information theory and communications. We propose an approximation to evaluate the probability of the union of several independent events that uses the arithmetic mean of the probability of all of them. The approximate results are very close to, but larger than the exact values. The method allows a much smaller number of operations with a similar result and more simplicity.</description>

      <title>On the minimum Hamming distance between vectorial Boolean and affine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hamming distance between vectorial Boolean functions and affine functions. This parameter is known to be related to the non-linearity and differential uniformity of vectorial functions, while the calculation of it is in general difficult. In 2017, Liu, Mesnager and Chen conjectured an upper bound for this metric. We prove this bound for two classes of vectorial bent functions, obtained from finite quasigroups in characteristic two, and we improve the known bounds for two classes of monomial functions of differential uniformity two or four. For many of the known APN functions of dimension at most nine, we compute the exact distance to affine functions.</description>

      <title>Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, offering potential advantages in rate and decoding efficiency. In this work, we introduce quantum Margulis codes, a new class of QLDPC codes derived from Margulis' classical LDPC construction via the two-block group algebra framework. We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike bivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective error correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder with linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is attributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group symmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in QLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for constructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or 8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error floor region, under min-sum decoding.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Federated Learning: A Conditional Mutual Information Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving distributed learning framework, yet its generalization performance remains less explored compared to centralized learning. In FL, the generalization error consists of two components: the out-of-sample gap, which measures the gap between the empirical and true risk for participating clients, and the participation gap, which quantifies the risk difference between participating and non-participating clients. In this work, we apply an information-theoretic analysis via the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework to study FL's two-level generalization. Beyond the traditional supersample-based CMI framework, we introduce a superclient construction to accommodate the two-level generalization setting in FL. We derive multiple CMI-based bounds, including hypothesis-based CMI bounds, illustrating how privacy constraints in FL can imply generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we propose fast-rate evaluated CMI bounds that recover the best-known convergence rate for two-level FL generalization in the small empirical risk regime. For specific FL model aggregation strategies and structured loss functions, we refine our bounds to achieve improved convergence rates with respect to the number of participating clients. Empirical evaluations confirm that our evaluated CMI bounds are non-vacuous and accurately capture the generalization behavior of FL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Task Offloading for Rotatable STAR-RIS-Enhanced Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can expand the coverage of mobile edge computing (MEC) services by reflecting and transmitting signals simultaneously, enabling full-space coverage. The orientation of the STAR-RIS plays a crucial role in optimizing the gain of received and transmitted signals, and a rotatable STAR-RIS offers potential enhancement for MEC systems. This paper investigates a rotatable STAR-RIS-assisted MEC system, operated under three protocols, namely energy splitting, mode switching, and time switching. The goal is to minimize energy consumption for multiple moving user devices through the joint optimization of STAR-RIS configurations, orientation, computation resource allocation, transmission power, and task offloading strategies. Considering the mobility of user devices, we model the original optimization problem as a sequential decision-making process across multiple time slots. The high-dimensional, highly coupled, and nonlinear nature makes it a challenging non-convex decision-making problem for traditional optimization algorithms. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is employed, specifically utilizing soft actor-critic algorithm to train the DRL model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks in both convergence speed and energy efficiency, while reducing energy consumption by up to 52.7\% compared to the fixed STAR-RIS scheme. Among three operating protocols, the energy splitting yields the best performance.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Graph Filtering via Multimodal Feature Refinement for Extremely Fast Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To overcome this limitation, we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method based on the notion of graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs through nontrivial multimodal feature refinement such as robust scaling and vector shifting by addressing the heterogeneous characteristics across modalities. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses multimodal information using linear low-pass filters across different modalities. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 13.35% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis and Optimization of Frequency-Hopping MIMO Radar with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-enabled frequency-hopping (FH) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system and investigate its sensing resolution. Specifically, we derive the expression of the ambiguity function and analyze the relationship between its main lobe width and the transmit antenna positions. In particular, the optimal antenna distribution to achieve the minimum main lobe width in the angular domain is characterized. We discover that this minimum width is related to the antenna size, the antenna number, and the target angle. Meanwhile, we present lower bounds of the ambiguity function in the Doppler and delay domains, and show that the impact of the antenna size on the radar performance in these two domains is very different from that in the angular domain. Moreover, the performance enhancement brought by MAs exhibits a certain trade-off between the main lobe width and the side lobe peak levels. Therefore, we propose to balance between minimizing the side lobe levels and narrowing the main lobe of the ambiguity function by optimizing the antenna positions. To achieve this goal, we propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the Rosen's gradient projection method, and show that its performance is very close to the baseline. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis on the properties of the ambiguity function, and demonstrate that MAs can reduce the main lobe width and suppress the side lobe levels of the ambiguity function, thereby enhancing radar performance.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Transformation and Analysis of Timelines through Learning via Surprisability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</description>

      <title>An Information-theoretic Multi-task Representation Learning Framework for Natural Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new principled multi-task representation learning framework (InfoMTL) to extract noise-invariant sufficient representations for all tasks. It ensures sufficiency of shared representations for all tasks and mitigates the negative effect of redundant features, which can enhance language understanding of pre-trained language models (PLMs) under the multi-task paradigm. Firstly, a shared information maximization principle is proposed to learn more sufficient shared representations for all target tasks. It can avoid the insufficiency issue arising from representation compression in the multi-task paradigm. Secondly, a task-specific information minimization principle is designed to mitigate the negative effect of potential redundant features in the input for each task. It can compress task-irrelevant redundant information and preserve necessary information relevant to the target for multi-task prediction. Experiments on six classification benchmarks show that our method outperforms 12 comparative multi-task methods under the same multi-task settings, especially in data-constrained and noisy scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the learned representations are more sufficient, data-efficient, and robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously establish a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which we show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional two-point mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes a theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths.</description>

      <title>Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations: The Observer Effect and its Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the propagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RIS, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies the fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges collectively. In particular, we examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system by considering its critical components and stringent conditions. The latter include: (a) two extremes of implementation complexity, represented by minimalist operation designs of two distinct HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We present empirical evidence that autonomous RISs remain promising under stringent conditions and outline research directions to deepen probe distortion understanding.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design for User-Centric Network Massive MIMO with Matrix Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the precoder design for user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink with matrix manifold optimization. In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.</description>

      <title>ComplexityMeasures.jl: scalable software to unify and accelerate entropy and complexity timeseries analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the nonlinear timeseries analysis literature, countless quantities have been presented as new ``entropy'' or ``complexity'' measures, often with similar roles. The ever-increasing pool of such measures makes creating a sustainable and all-encompassing software for them difficult both conceptually and pragmatically. Such a software however would be an important tool that can aid researchers make an informed decision of which measure to use and for which application, as well as accelerate novel research. Here we present {ComplexityMeasures.jl}, an easily extendable and highly performant open-source software that implements a vast selection of complexity measures. The software provides 1638 measures with 3,841 lines of source code, averaging only 2.3 lines of code per exported quantity (version 3.7). This is made possible by its mathematically rigorous composable design. In this paper we discuss the software design and demonstrate how it can accelerate complexity-related research in the future. We carefully compare it with alternative software and conclude that {ComplexityMeasures.jl} outclasses the alternatives in several objective aspects of comparison, such as computational performance, overall amount of measures, reliability, and extendability. {ComplexityMeasures.jl} is also a component of the {DynamicalSystems.jl} library for nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear timeseries analysis and follows open source development practices for creating a sustainable community of developers and contributors.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Goal-Oriented Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on goal-oriented considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, goal-oriented scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by goal-oriented communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference</title>

Abstract: Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing MIA effectiveness, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI? Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical research, methodological design, and practical constraint.
  To overcome these limitations, we establish the first theoretical criterion formula to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE). Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experimental results show that SiftFunnel outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving strong privacy protection with an average accuracy loss of around 3\% and an optimal trade-off between usability, privacy, and practicality.</description>
