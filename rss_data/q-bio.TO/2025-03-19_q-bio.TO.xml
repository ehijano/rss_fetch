      <title>Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating percentage bone loss is a critical test for periodontal disease staging but is sometimes imprecise and time consuming when manually calculated. This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

      <title>A tumor-immune model of chronic myeloid leukemia with optimal immunotherapeutic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between tumor cells and the immune system play a crucial role in cancer evolution. In this study, we explore how these interactions influence cancer progression by modeling the relationships among naive T cells, effector T cells, and chronic myeloid leukemia cells. We examine the existence of equilibria, the asymptotic stability of the positive steady state, and the global stability of the tumor-free equilibrium. Additionally, we develop a partial differential equation to describe the conditions under which the concentration of cancer cells reaches a level that allows for effective control of cancer evolution. Finally, we apply our proposed model to investigate optimal treatment strategies that aim to minimize both the concentration of cancer cells at the end of treatment and the accumulation of tumor burden, as well as the cost associated with treatment during the intervention period. Our study reveals an optimal therapeutic protocol using optimal control theory. We perform numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results and to explore the dynamic behavior of the system and optimal therapeutic protocols. The simulations indicate that the optimal treatment strategy can be more effective than a constant treatment approach, even when applying the same treatment interval and total drug input.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling of Buruli ulcer spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches to a model deduction for Buruli ulcer spread in a tissue, prove global existence of solutions to the obtained macroscopic cross-diffusion PDE-ODE systems, and perform numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of solutions under various scenarios and compare the outcome of the two approaches.</description>
