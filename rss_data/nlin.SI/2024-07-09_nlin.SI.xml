      <title>Action-angle variables for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation on the half-line subjecting to a class of boundary conditions preserve the integrability of the model. For such a half-line problem, the Poisson brackets of the corresponding scattering data are computed, and the variables of action-angle type are constructed. These action-angle variables completely trivialize the dynamics of the NLS equation on the half-line.</description>

      <title>Regular F -manifolds with eventual identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an F-manifold one may construct a dual multiplication (generalizing the idea of an almost-dual Frobenius manifold introduced by Dubrovin) using a so-called eventual identity, the definition of which ensure that the dual object is also an F-manifold. In this paper we solve the equations for an eventual identity for a regular (so non-semi-simple) F-manifold and construct a dual coordinate system in which dual multiplication is preserved. As an application, families of Nijenhuis operators are constructed.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of coupled Burgers-like equations induced by conditional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that $Q$-conditional symmetries of the classical Burgers' equation express in terms of three functions satisfying a coupled system of Burgers-like equations. The search of conditional symmetries of this system leads to a system of five coupled Burgers-like equations. Iterating the procedure, an infinite hierarchy of systems made of an odd number of coupled Burgers-like equations is obtained. Moreover, starting from a pair of Burgers-like equations, a similar hierarchy of systems made of an even number of coupled Burgers-like equations arises; it is also proved that the two hierarchies may be unified. Writing a generic element of this hierarchy as a matrix Burgers' equation, the existence of the matrix Hopf-Cole transformation allows for its linearization and the determination of its solution. Finally, it is shown that each element of the hierarchy possesses a five-dimensional Lie algebra of classical point symmetries. Though these Lie algebras are realized in manifolds with different dimensionality, they are all isomorphic.</description>

      <title>The solutions of classical and nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with nonzero backgrounds: Bilinearisation and reduction approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04826v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a bilinearisation-reduction approach to derive solutions to the classical and nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equations with nonzero backgrounds. We start from the second order Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur coupled equations as an unreduced system. With a pair of solutions $(q_0,r_0)$ we bilinearize the unreduced system and obtain solutions in terms of quasi double Wronskians. Then we implement reductions by introducing constraints on the column vectors of the Wronskians and finally obtain solutions to the reduced equations, including the classical NLS equation and the nonlocal NLS equations with reverse-space, reverse-time and reverse-space-time, respectively. With a set of plane wave solution $(q_0,r_0)$ as a background solution, we present explicit formulae for these column vectors. As examples, we analyze and illustrate solutions to the focusing NLS equation and the reverse-space nonlocal NLS equation. In particular, we present formulae for the rouge waves of arbitrary order for the focusing NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Transient asymptotics of the modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate long time asymptotics of the modified Camassa-Holm equation in three transition zones under a nonzero background. The first transition zone lies between the soliton region and the first oscillatory region, the second one lies between the second oscillatory region and the fast decay region, and possibly, the third one, namely, the collisionless shock region, that bridges the first transition region and the first oscillatory region. Under a low regularity condition on the initial data, we obtain Painlev\'e-type asymptotic formulas in the first two transition regions, while the transient asymptotics in the third region involves the Jacobi theta function. We establish our results by performing a $\bar{\partial}$ nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>
