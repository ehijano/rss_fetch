      <title>Localizing Preference Aggregation Conflicts: A Graph-Theoretic Approach Using Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a graph-theoretic framework based on discrete sheaves to diagnose and localize inconsistencies in preference aggregation. Unlike traditional linearization methods (e.g., HodgeRank), this approach preserves the discrete structure of ordinal preferences, identifying which specific voter interactions cause aggregation failure -- information that global methods cannot provide -- via the Obstruction Locus. We formalize the Incompatibility Index to quantify these local conflicts and examine their behavior under stochastic variations using the Mallows model. Additionally, we develop a rigorous sheaf-theoretic pushforward operation to model voter merging, implemented via a polynomial-time constraint DAG algorithm. We demonstrate that graph quotients transform distributed edge conflicts into local impossibilities (empty stalks), providing a topological characterization of how aggregation paradoxes persist across scales.</description>

      <title>Convergence to stationary points in the Weisbuch-Kirman-Herreiner model for buyers' preferences in fish markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper published in The Economic Journal in 2000, Weisbuch et al.\ introduce a model for buyers' preferences to the various sellers in over-the-counter (OTC) fish markets. While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit.</description>

      <title>A new family of models with generalized orientation in data envelopment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of data envelopment analysis, we review directional models \citep{Chambers1996, Chambers1998, Briec1997} and show that they are inadequate when inputs and outputs are improved simultaneously under constant returns to scale. Conversely, we introduce a new family of quadratically constrained models with generalized orientation and demonstrate that these models overcome this limitation. Furthermore, we extend the Farrell measure of technical efficiency using these new models. Additionally, we prove that the family of generalized oriented models satisfies some desired monotonicity properties. Finally, we show that the new models, although being quadratically constrained, can be solved through linear programs in a fundamental particular case.</description>

      <title>Pricing AI Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the market for AI models in which firms compete to provide accurate model predictions and consumers exhibit heterogeneous preferences for model accuracy. We develop a consumer-firm duopoly model to analyze how competition affects firms' incentives to improve model accuracy. Each firm aims to minimize its model's error, but this choice can often be suboptimal. Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms that improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather, each firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where it has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive and false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through investments. Firms are strictly better off investing on their superior dimension and strictly worse off with investments on their inferior dimension. Profitable investments adversely affect consumers but increase overall welfare.</description>
