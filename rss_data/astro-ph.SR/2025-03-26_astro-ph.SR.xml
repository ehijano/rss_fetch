      <title>A Spectroscopic Survey of Metal-Poor OB Stars in Local Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3109</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As JWST uncovers increasingly strong evidence that metal-poor, massive stars in early galaxies dominated reionization, observational constraints on the properties of such stars are more relevant than ever before. However, spectra of individual O- and B-type stars are rare at the relevant metallicities ($\lesssim 0.2$ $Z_\odot$), leaving models of stellar evolution and ionizing flux poorly constrained by data in this regime. We present new medium-resolution ($R\sim 4000)$ Keck/DEIMOS optical spectra of 17 OB stars in the local low-metallicity ($0.12$ $Z_\odot$) dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We assign spectral types to the stars and present new criteria for selecting O stars using optical and NUV photometry from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We fit the spectra and photometry with grids of stellar atmosphere models to measure stellar temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities, radii, and masses. We find evidence of strong mass loss via radiation-driven stellar winds in two O stars, one of which is the hottest, youngest, and most massive star confirmed in the host galaxy to date. Though its spectrum does not meet conventional Wolf-Rayet spectral classification criteria, this metal-poor O If star produces strong He II 4686 emission and its evolutionary status is ambiguous. This work nearly doubles the number of OB stars with measured parameters in NGC 3109, including ten stars with no previously reported parameters, four with no published spectroscopy, and four binary candidates. This large sample of OB stellar parameters provides a new observational testbed to constrain the stellar astrophysics that drove cosmic reionization and influenced the evolution of the earliest galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Multi-viewpoint CME Catalog Based on SoloHI Observed Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are significant drivers of geomagnetic activity, and understanding these structures is critical to developing and improving forecasting tools for space weather. The Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission, with its comprehensive set of remote sensing and in-situ instruments, along with its unique orbit, is significantly advancing the study of the CMEs and other structures in the heliosphere. A critical contribution to the study of CMEs by SolO is the observations from the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI). SoloHI observes photospheric visible light scattered by electrons in the solar wind and provides high-resolution observations of the corona and heliosphere. The resolution and vantage point offered by SoloHI make it uniquely well-suited to study CME evolution in the heliosphere. We present the initial release of a living CME catalog based on SoloHI observations during its initial years of observations, with a multi-viewpoint focus. We catalog 140 events detected by SoloHI during the period of January 2022 until April 2023. For each event detected by SoloHI, we present available in-situ data and remote sensing observations detected by other missions. We identify the source region of the CME and describe its main characteristics, track the CME through the coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and provide in-situ detection when possible. We also provide a morphological classification and observations quality parameter based on the SoloHI observations. Additionally, we cross-check with other available CME catalogs and link to the event description provided by the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) catalog. We provide various observing scenarios with SoloHI observations to demonstrate the contribution that this catalog offers to the scientific community to explore the new observing viewpoint of CMEs with the SolO mission.</description>

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae. Binaries among multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars</description>

      <title>The physical association of planetary nebula NGC 2818 with open cluster NGC 2818A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) that are physical members of open star clusters (OCs) are valuable for stellar evolution studies. They are extremely rare, with only three such instances confirmed in our Galaxy. Here, we confirm the physical association of PN NGC 2818 with OC NGC 2818A, an association long debated in the literature, adding a fourth object to the sample of rare OC-PN pairs. The physical properties of the PN can then be linked to those of its progenitor star. Using GHOST/Gemini high-resolution nebular spectra, we measured the PN systemic radial velocity to compare it with that of the putative host cluster, determined from Gaia. We estimated the physical parameters of both the OC and the PN using our data, together with estimates from previous studies and theoretical cluster isochrones and evolutionary tracks to show they are compatible. The precise, systemic radial velocity of the PN that was determined, is consistent among the errors with that of the OC and its 1 km/s associated velocity dispersion, a primary requirement for cluster membership. We have determined other physical parameters of the PN and the OC, such as age and distance, which also match within the errors. These results present compelling evidence for the physical association of the PN and the OC. The PN age was found to be 11 kyr and the effective temperature of its central star was estimated as 130 kK. The initial and final masses of the progenitor star were determined to be 2.33$\pm$0.10 Msol and 0.58$\pm$0.10 Msol respectively. We plotted the resulting data point on the latest initial-to-final-mass relation. This new data point agrees with the previously published trends and further delineates the 'kink' found at relatively low initial masses. All four OC-PN associations, identified thus far, share a number of common properties. These rare cases merit detailed OC-PN studies and work to further extend the sample.</description>

      <title>A 1.48-2.48 $\mathrm{\mu}$m R=28000 spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the nearest pair of brown dwarfs: Luhman 16AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.</description>

      <title>Connections between the cycle-to-cycle light curve and O-C variations of the non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that if the durations of the consecutive cycles of a pulsating star vary randomly, the O-C diagram could show quasi-periodic/irregular variations, even though the actual average period is constant. It is hypothesised that the period variation observed in many RR Lyrae stars, which are much faster and stronger than may be explained by an evolutionary origin, may in fact be caused by this cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variation effect. So far, quantitative studies have not really been performed, and space data have not been used at all. Our primary goal was to quantitatively analyse the O$-$C diagrams of RR Lyrae stars obtained from space photometry and explained by quasi-periodic or irregular periodic variations to see if they can be explained by random fluctuations in pulsation cycle length without assuming real period variations. We fitted statistical models to the O-C diagrams and tested their validity and fit. The necessary analysis of the light curves was performed using standard Fourier methods. We found that the vast majority of the O-C curves can be satisfactorily explained by assuming timing noise and the C2C variation without a real mean period variation. We have shown that the strength of the C2C variation is strongly dependent on the pulsation period and metallicity. These correlations suggests that turbulent convection may be behind the C2C variation. The additional frequencies of some RR Lyrae stars and their variation over time play only a marginal role in O-Cs. We have found new arguments that the phase jump phenomenon in RRc stars is in fact a continuous change, moreover, it could also be caused by the C2C variation.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification of young stars using conditional invertible neural networks II. Application to Trumpler 14 in Carina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an updated version of our deep learning tool that predicts stellar parameters from the optical spectra of young low-mass stars with intermediate spectral resolution. We adopt a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) architecture to infer the posterior distribution of stellar parameters and train our cINN on two Phoenix stellar atmosphere model libraries (Settl and Dusty). Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the updated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the parameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We test the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic error of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III template stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we estimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those derived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g, Av, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses derived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with those measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff derived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the cINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting appear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an average age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact of veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that the main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the previous study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered simultaneously in their process.</description>

      <title>Chromospherically active stars: Chemical composition of photospheres in 20 RS CVn stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Various element transport processes modify the photospheric chemical composition of low-mass stars during their evolution. The most prominent one is the first dredge-up that occurs at the beginning of the red giant branch. Then, various extra-mixing processes, such as those caused by thermohaline- and/or rotation-induced mixing, come into action. The extent of the influence of stellar magnetic activity on alterations in stellar chemical composition is among the least studied questions. Aims. To investigate how magnetic activity influences mixing in the atmospheres of magnetically active stars, we carried out a detailed study of C, N, and up to ten other chemical element abundances, as well as carbon isotope ratios in a sample of RS CVn stars. Methods. Using a differential model atmosphere method, we analysed high-resolution spectra that had been observed with the VUES spectrograph on the 1.65 m telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory of Vilnius University. Abundances of other chemical elements were determined from equivalent widths or spectral syntheses of unblended spectral lines. Results. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and abundances of up to 12 chemical elements for a sample of 20 RS CVn giants that represented different evolutionary stages. We determined that *29 Dra, *b01 Cyg, and V* V834 Her, which are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump, already show evidence of extra-mixing in their lowered carbon isotope ratios. Conclusions. We provide observational evidence that in low-mass chromospherically active RS CVn stars, due to their magnetic activity, extra-mixing processes may start acting below the luminosity bump of the red giant branch.</description>

      <title>Helmet streamer influence on the evolution of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Solar eruptions are crucial for space weather studies. Understanding the mechanisms influencing their evolution is key to improving predictions of their geoeffectiveness. Helmet streamers (HSs) are persistent structures in the solar corona, present in both minimum and maximum solar activity periods. These structures contain a current sheet of low magnetic energy, where coronal mass ejections (CMEs) tend to deflect. However, they also feature a closed magnetic field region beneath this sheet, often confining eruptions. Their complexity makes predicting eruptions challenging. Aims: This study examines how HSs influence the evolution and potential confinement of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). We explore magnetic configurations where the MFR is more likely to rise through the overlying field, aiming to establish simple parameters that help predict whether an MFR will ascend or remain confined. Methods: Using 2.5D MHD simulations, we model MFR dynamics in the presence of an HS, analyzing different magnetic configurations and focusing on the mechanisms that enable ascent or confinement. Results: Null-point reconnection plays a key role in MFR dynamics. Depending on the initial configuration, it can either disrupt the MFR, preventing ascent, or reduce the strapping flux, facilitating upward motion. We identify a critical threshold: if the strapping flux above the MFR is less than two-thirds of its poloidal flux, the MFR ascends successfully. Conclusions: Our simulations show that null-point reconnection significantly impacts MFR ascent. A key predictor of successful rise is the initial ratio of the MFR's poloidal flux to the strapping flux above it.</description>

      <title>The robust detection and spatial distribution of acetaldehyde in Orion KL: ALMA observations and chemical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the organic molecule inventory detected in Orion KL, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) -- one of the most ubiquitous interstellar aldehydes -- has not been firmly identified with mm-wave interferometry. We analyze extensive ALMA archival datasets (142-355 GHz) to search for acetaldehyde, revealing two distinct acetaldehyde emission peaks and one component with more complex kinematic structures. One peak aligns with MF10/IRc2, where emissions of other O-bearing complex organic molecules are rarely reported, while the other is coincident with the ethanol peak in the hot core-SW. The MF10/IRc2 detection suggests unique chemistry, possibly influenced by repeated heating events. In contrast, co-detection with ethanol indicates an ice origin and suggests a potential chemical relationship between the two species. We determined acetaldehyde column densities and its kinetic temperatures toward these two peaks under LTE assumptions and compare its distribution with ethanol and other molecules that have an aldehyde (HCO) group, such as methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, and formic acid. Toward the ethanol peak, observed abundance ratios between HCO-containing species are analyzed using a chemical model. The model suggests two key points: 1) the destruction of ethanol to form acetaldehyde in the ice may contribute to the observed correlation between the two species, 2) a long cold-collapse timescale and a methyl formate binding energy similar to or lower than water are needed to explain the observations. The relative abundance ratios obtained from the model are highly sensitive to the assumed kinetic temperature, which accounts for the high spatial variability of the aldehyde ratios observed toward Orion KL.</description>

      <title>Studying Binary Systems in Omega Centauri with MUSE: II. Observational constraints on the orbital period distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is one of the most complex star clusters in the Milky Way, and likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Being the subject of debate between it hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a collection of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in its center, $\omega$ Cen has been intensively studied over the past decades. Our work focuses on characterizing the properties of binary systems in $\omega$ Cen via multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopic observations spanning over eight years and covering much of its central regions (i.e. core radius). We did not detect any stellar-mass BHs candidates orbiting luminous stars, although mock samples indicate a high sensitivity of our survey to such systems. This suggests that BHs orbiting stars may be rare in $\omega$ Cen or in wide orbits around low-mass companions (where our survey is 50% complete) or that the periods of such systems are longer than expected from cluster dynamics. Additionally, we constrained the orbital properties of 19 binary systems in the cluster, with periods ranging from fractions of a day up to several hundred days. We observe an excess of binaries with P $\ge$ 10 d and find evidence that the intrinsic period distribution of binaries in $\omega$ Cen differs from those predicted by cluster evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the final saturated magnetic field strength exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing or energy equipartition with the turbulence, scaling as $B \propto \rho^{5/6}$, where $\rho$ is the cloud density. Apart from establishing a formal framework for the studies of magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings have significant implications for early star and galaxy formation, suggesting that magnetic fields can be amplified to dynamically relevant strengths much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>The metal-poorest tail of the Galactic halo: hypothesis on its origin from precise spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the Galactic halo is one of the fundamental topics linking the study of galaxy formation and evolution to cosmology. We aim at deriving precise and accurate stellar parameters, Mg abundances, and ages for a sample of metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $&lt;$ -2 dex from high signal-to-noise and high resolution spectra. We derive effective temperatures from H$\alpha$ profiles using three-dimensional non local thermodynamic equilibrium (3D NLTE) models, and surface gravities and ages from isochrone fitting based on Gaia data. Iron abundances were derived in one-dimensional (1D) NLTE, while Mg abundances were derived in 1D LTE, 1D NLTE, 3D LTE, and 3D NLTE to show the increasing level of accuracy. The stars show a tight trend in the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] plane with a knee at [Fe/H]$\sim$ -2.8 dex, which indicates a low level of stochasticity. Their location in the Lindblad diagram confirms their belonging to the Galactic halo, but does not show a distinct clustering that might be expected for a merger with a single low-mass galaxy. Comparison with chemical evolution models is also not definitive on whether the sample stars were born in-situ or in accreted low-mass galaxy mergers. We find two plausible explanations for the chemical sequence traced by the stars in the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] plane. One is that the sample stars originated in the already formed Milky Way, which at that time (12.5 Gyr ago) was already the main galaxy of its Local Group surroundings. Another one is that the sample stars originated in several small galaxies with similar properties, which later merged with the Galaxy. Only accurate spectroscopic analysis such as that done here can reveal trustworthy chemical diagrams required to observe the traces of the Galaxy evolution. Other elements are required to discern between the two hypotheses.</description>

      <title>The Age of the Universe with Globular Clusters III: Gaia distances and hierarchical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third article in a series aimed at computing accurate and precise ages of galactic globular clusters from their full color-magnitude diagram in order to estimate the age of the Universe and in turn constrain the cosmological model. We update previous constraints using additional data and an improved methodology which allows us to vary the helium abundance and the reddening law in addition to the usual parameters (age, metallicity, alpha enhancement, distance and absorption) in the analysis. Even with the additional degrees of freedom, using the full color-magnitude diagram, now described as a Gaussian mixture Bayesian hierarchical model, a tight constraint on the age(s) of the globular clusters and on the other parameters can be obtained, and the statistical errors are fully subdominant to the systematic errors. We find that the age of the oldest globular clusters is $t_{\rm GC} = 13.39 \pm 0.10 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ Gyr, resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{\rm U}=13.57^{+ 0.16}_{-0.14} ({\rm stat})\pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ and a robust 95\% confidence upper limit of $t_U^{\leq}=13.92_{-0.1}^{+0.13}({\rm stat}) \pm{0.23} ({\rm sys})$. This is fully compatible with our previous estimates and with the model-dependent, Cosmic Microwave Background-derived age for the Universe of $t_{\rm U} =13.8 \pm 0.02$ Gyr for a $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Characterising M dwarf host stars of two candidate Hycean worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary systems orbiting M dwarf host stars are promising targets for atmospheric characterisation of low-mass exoplanets. Accurate characterisation of M dwarf hosts is important for detailed understanding of the planetary properties and physical processes, including potential habitability. Recent studies have identified several candidate Hycean planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs as promising targets in the search for habitability and life on exoplanets. In this study, we characterise two such M dwarf host stars, K2-18 and TOI-732. Using archival photometric and spectroscopic observations, we estimate their effective temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$) and metallicities through high-resolution spectral analyses and ages through gyrochronology. We assess the stellar activity of the targets by analysing activity-sensitive chromospheric lines and X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we predict activity cycles based on measured rotation periods and utilise photometric data to estimate the current stellar activity phase. We find K2-18 to be 2.9-3.1 Gyr old with T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 3645$\pm$52 K and metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10$\pm$0.12 dex, and TOI-732 to be older (6.7-8.6 Gyr), cooler (3213$\pm$92 K), and more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22$\pm$0.13 dex). Both stars exhibit relatively low activity making them favourable for atmospheric observations of their planets. The predicted activity cycle and analysis of available high-precision photometry for K2-18 suggest that it might have been near an activity minimum during recent JWST observations, though some residual activity may be expected at such minima. We predict potential activity levels for both targets to aid future observations, and highlight the importance of accurate characterisation of M dwarf host stars for exoplanet characterisation.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Validating Physics Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present generative artificial intelligence (AI) to empirically validate fundamental laws of physics, focusing on the Stefan-Boltzmann law linking stellar temperature and luminosity. Our approach simulates counterfactual luminosities under hypothetical temperature regimes for each individual star and iteratively refines the temperature-luminosity relationship in a deep learning architecture. We use Gaia DR3 data and find that, on average, temperature's effect on luminosity increases with stellar radius and decreases with absolute magnitude, consistent with theoretical predictions. By framing physics laws as causal problems, our method offers a novel, data-driven approach to refine theoretical understanding and inform evidence-based policy and practice.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in virtual: II. Origin of skewness and dual fraction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
