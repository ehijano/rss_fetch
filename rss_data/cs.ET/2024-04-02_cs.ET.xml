      <title>Mitigating Transient Bullwhip Effects Under Imperfect Demand Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by how forecast errors exacerbate order fluctuations in supply chains, we use tools from robust control theory to characterize and compute the worst-case order fluctuation experienced by an individual supply chain vendor under bounded forecast errors and demand fluctuations. Building on existing discrete time, linear time-invariant (LTI) models of supply chains, we separately model forecast error and demand fluctuations as inputs to the inventory dynamics. We then define a transient Bullwhip measure to evaluate the vendor's worst-case order fluctuation and show that for bounded forecast errors and demand fluctuations, this measure is equivalent to the disturbance to control peak gain. To compute the controller that minimizes the worst-case peak gain, we formulate an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequalities and show that solving this problem is equivalent to minimizing a quasi-convex function on a bounded domain. In contrast to the existing Bullwhip measure in literature, the transient Bullwhip measure has an explicit dependency on the forecast error and does not need the forecast to be a deterministic function of the demand history. This explicit dependency enables us to separately quantify the transient Bullwhip measure's sensitivity to forecast error and demand fluctuations. We empirically verify our model for vendors with non-zero perishable rates and order backlogging rates.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Based Lightweight Encryption</title>

Abstract: Next-generation personalized healthcare devices are undergoing extreme miniaturization in order to improve user acceptability. However, such developments make it difficult to incorporate cryptographic primitives using available target technologies since these algorithms are notorious for their energy consumption. Besides, strengthening these schemes against side-channel attacks further adds to the device overheads. Therefore, viable alternatives among emerging technologies are being sought. In this work, we investigate the possibility of using memristors for implementing lightweight encryption. We propose a 40-nm RRAM-based GIFT-cipher implementation using a 1T1R configuration with promising results; it exhibits roughly half the energy consumption of a CMOS-only implementation. More importantly, its non-volatile and reconfigurable substitution boxes offer an energy-efficient protection mechanism against side-channel attacks. The complete cipher takes 0.0034 mm$^2$ of area, and encrypting a 128-bit block consumes a mere 242 pJ.</description>

      <title>Review of Distributed Quantum Computing. From single QPU to High Performance Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of quantum computing has shown it might change how we process information by using the unique principles of quantum mechanics. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of quantum technologies to unprecedented levels, distributed quantum computing raises as an obvious path to explore with the aim of boosting the computational power of current quantum systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of the art in the distributed quantum computing field, exploring its foundational principles, landscape of achievements, challenges, and promising directions for further research. From quantum communication protocols to entanglement-based distributed algorithms, each aspect contributes to the mosaic of distributed quantum computing, making it an attractive approach to address the limitations of classical computing. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive overview for experienced researchers and field newcomers.</description>

      <title>Double-Free-Layer Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions with Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJ) using low-barrier nanomagnets have shown promise as fast, energy-efficient, and scalable building blocks for probabilistic computing. Despite recent experimental and theoretical progress, sMTJs exhibiting the ideal characteristics necessary for probabilistic bits (p-bit) are still lacking. Ideally, the sMTJs should have (a) voltage bias independence preventing read disturbance (b) uniform randomness in the magnetization angle between the free layers, and (c) fast fluctuations without requiring external magnetic fields while being robust to magnetic field perturbations. Here, we propose a new design satisfying all of these requirements, using double-free-layer sMTJs with synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF). We evaluate the proposed sMTJ design with experimentally benchmarked spin-circuit models accounting for transport physics, coupled with the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. We find that the use of low-barrier SAF layers reduces dipolar coupling, achieving uncorrelated fluctuations at zero-magnetic field surviving up to diameters exceeding ($D\approx 100$ nm) if the nanomagnets can be made thin enough ($\approx 1$-$2$ nm). The double-free-layer structure retains bias-independence and the circular nature of the nanomagnets provides near-uniform randomness with fast fluctuations. Combining our full sMTJ model with advanced transistor models, we estimate the energy to generate a random bit as $\approx$ 3.6 fJ, with fluctuation rates of $\approx$ 3.3 GHz per p-bit. Our results will guide the experimental development of superior stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions for large-scale and energy-efficient probabilistic computation for problems relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Robust UWOC-assisted Multi-hop Topology for Underwater Sensor Network Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>
