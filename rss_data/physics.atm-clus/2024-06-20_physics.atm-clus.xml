      <title>Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks in Interpretation of X-ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoder-decoder neural networks (EDNN) condense information most relevant to the output of the feedforward network to activation values at a bottleneck layer. We study the use of this architecture in emulation and interpretation of simulated X-ray spectroscopic data with the aim to identify key structural characteristics for the spectra, previously studied using emulator-based component analysis (ECA). We find an EDNN to outperform ECA in covered target variable variance, but also discover complications in interpreting the latent variables in physical terms. As a compromise of the benefits of these two approaches, we develop a network where the linear projection of ECA is used, thus maintaining the beneficial characteristics of vector expansion from the latent variables for their interpretation. These results underline the necessity of information recovery after its condensation and identification of decisive structural degrees for the output spectra for a justified interpretation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of sympathetic cooling efficiency in a linear Paul trap driven by alternative waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling of ions or other charged particles in electromagnetic traps is an essential tool to achieve control over their degrees of freedom on the quantum level. For many objects, there is no viable route for direct cooling, such as an accessible laser cooling transition. In such a case, the sympathetic cooling can be used, where a particle with such a direct route is used to cool down the other particle via Coulomb interaction. On the downside, this cooling process often is inefficient. Here, we numerically evaluate the sympathetic cooling performance in a quadrupole ion trap for different driving waveforms. We find that using different driving waveforms and optimized trap parameters the sympathetic cooling performance can be enhanced. These results will open up the way to achieve larger sympathetic cooling rates from which many techniques, such as aluminum ion clocks, might profit.</description>

      <title>Entangled Matter-waves for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to create and harness entanglement is crucial to the fields of quantum sensing andsimulation, and ultracold atom-cavity systems offer pristine platforms for this undertaking. Recently, an experiment demonstrated an effective momentum-exchange interaction between atoms in a common cavity mode. Here, we derive this interaction from a general atom-cavity model, and discuss the role of the cavity frequency shift in response to atomic motion. We show the cavity response leads to many different squeezing interactions between the atomic momentum states. Furthermore, when the atoms form a density grating, the collective motion leads to one-axis twisting, a many-body energy gap, and metrologically useful entanglement even in the presence of noise. This system offers a highly tunable, many-body quantum sensor and simulator.</description>
