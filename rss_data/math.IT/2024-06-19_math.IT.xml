      <title>A Construction of Optimal Quasi-cyclic Locally Recoverable Codes using Constituent Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A locally recoverable code of locality $r$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is a code where every coordinate of a codeword can be recovered using the values of at most $r$ other coordinates of that codeword. Locally recoverable codes are efficient at restoring corrupted messages and data which make them highly applicable to distributed storage systems. Quasi-cyclic codes of length $n=m\ell$ and index $\ell$ are linear codes that are invariant under cyclic shifts by $\ell$ places. %Quasi-cyclic codes are generalizations of cyclic codes and are isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_{q} [x]/ \langle x^m-1 \rangle$-submodules of $\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell} [x] / \langle x^m-1 \rangle$. In this paper, we decompose quasi-cyclic locally recoverable codes into a sum of constituent codes where each constituent code is a linear code over a field extension of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Using these constituent codes with set parameters, we propose conditions which ensure the existence of almost optimal and optimal quasi-cyclic locally recoverable codes with increased dimension and code length.</description>

      <title>Block Circulant Codes with Application to Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of linear dependence relations between coded symbols of a linear code, irrespective of specific coefficients involved, is referred to as the {\em topology} of the code. The specification of coefficients is referred to as an {\em instantiation} of the topology. In this paper, we propose a new block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$ parameterized by integers $\rho \geq 2$, $\omega \geq 1$, $\lambda \geq 2$, and $\mu$ a multiple of $\lambda$. In this topology, the code has $\mu$ local codes with $\rho$ parity-check (p-c) constraints and a total of $\mu\rho$ p-c equations fully define the code. Next, we construct a class of block circulant (BC) codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ with blocklength $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, dimension $k=\mu\omega$ that instantiate $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. Every local code of ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ is a $[\rho+\lambda\omega,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized Reed-Solomon (RS) code. The overlap between supports of local codes helps to enhance the minimum distance $\rho+1$ to $2\rho+1$, without compromising much on the rate. We provide an efficient, parallelizable decoding algorithm to correct $2\rho$ erasures when $\lambda=2$. Finally, we illustrate that the BC codes serve as a viable alternative to 2D RS codes in protocols designed to tackle blockchain networks' data availability (DA) problem. In these protocols, every node in a network of light nodes randomly queries symbols from a codeword stored in full nodes and verifies them using a cryptographic commitment scheme. For the same performance in tackling the DA problem, the BC code requires querying a smaller number of symbols than a comparable 2D RS code for a fixed high rate. Furthermore, the number of local codes in the BC code is typically smaller, yielding a reduction in the complexity of realizing the commitment scheme.</description>

      <title>Sparse MIMO for ISAC: New Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been a key technology of wireless communications for decades. A typical MIMO system employs antenna arrays with the inter-antenna spacing being half of the signal wavelength, which we term as compact MIMO. Looking forward towards the future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, MIMO system will achieve even finer spatial resolution to not only enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless communications, but also enable more accurate wireless sensing. To this end, by removing the restriction of half-wavelength antenna spacing, sparse MIMO has been proposed as a new architecture that is able to significantly enlarge the array aperture as compared to conventional compact MIMO with the same number of array elements. In addition, sparse MIMO leads to a new form of virtual MIMO systems for sensing with their virtual apertures considerably larger than physical apertures. As sparse MIMO is expected to be a viable technology for 6G, we provide in this article a comprehensive overview of it, especially focusing on its appealing advantages for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) towards 6G. Specifically, assorted sparse MIMO architectures are first introduced, followed by their new benefits as well as challenges. We then discuss the main design issues of sparse MIMO, including beam pattern synthesis, signal processing, grating lobe suppression, beam codebook design, and array geometry optimization. Last, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of sparse MIMO for ISAC and point out promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>On The Effective Rate and Error Rate Analysis over Fluctuating Nakagami-m Fading Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the important performance metrics like effective capacity and symbol error rate over fluctuating Nakagami-m fading channel. This distribution is obtained from the ratio of two random variables, following the Nakagami-m distribution and the uniform distribution. Our study derives exact analytical expressions for the EC and SER under different modulation schemes, considering the effect of channel parameters. Recognising the importance of additive Laplacian noise in today scenario, it has been considered for the error performance analysis of the system. This work may be utilised for the design and optimization of the systems operating in environments characterized by fluctuating Nakagami-m fading.</description>

      <title>Multi-Active-IRS-Assisted Cooperative Sensing: Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound and Joint Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cooperative sensing, in which multiple active IRSs are deployed in a distributed manner to facilitate multi-view target sensing at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the base station (BS). Different from prior works employing passive IRSs, we leverage active IRSs with the capability of amplifying the reflected signals to overcome the severe multi-hop-reflection path loss in NLoS sensing. In particular, we consider two sensing setups without and with dedicated sensors equipped at active IRSs. In the first case without dedicated sensors at IRSs, we investigate the cooperative sensing at the BS, where the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to each IRS is estimated based on the echo signals received at the BS. In the other case with dedicated sensors at IRSs, we consider that each IRS is able to receive echo signals and estimate the target's DoA with respect to itself. For both sensing setups, we first derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating target DoA. Then, the (maximum) CRB is minimized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the multiple IRSs, subject to the constraints on the maximum transmit power at the BS, as well as the maximum amplification power and the maximum power amplification gain constraints at individual active IRSs. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex (max-)CRB minimization problems, we propose two efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the two cases with sensing at the BS and at the IRSs, respectively, based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation.</description>

      <title>On perfect symmetric rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Sym}_q(m)$ be the space of symmetric matrices in $\mathbb{F}_q^{m\times m}$. A subspace of $\mathrm{Sym}_q(m)$ equipped with the rank distance is called a symmetric rank-metric code. In this paper we study the covering properties of symmetric rank-metric codes. First we characterize symmetric rank-metric codes which are perfect, i.e. that satisfy the equality in the sphere-packing like bound. We show that, despite the rank-metric case, there are non trivial perfect codes. Also, we characterize families of codes which are quasi-perfect.</description>

      <title>Order-Optimal Instance-Dependent Bounds for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) with preference feedback in which the implicit reward is a linear function of an unknown parameter. Given an offline dataset, our objective consists in ascertaining the optimal action for each state, with the ultimate goal of minimizing the {\em simple regret}. We propose an algorithm, \underline{RL} with \underline{L}ocally \underline{O}ptimal \underline{W}eights or {\sc RL-LOW}, which yields a simple regret of $\exp ( - \Omega(n/H) )$ where $n$ is the number of data samples and $H$ denotes an instance-dependent hardness quantity that depends explicitly on the suboptimality gap of each action. Furthermore, we derive a first-of-its-kind instance-dependent lower bound in offline RL with preference feedback. Interestingly, we observe that the lower and upper bounds on the simple regret match order-wise in the exponent, demonstrating order-wise optimality of {\sc RL-LOW}. In view of privacy considerations in practical applications, we also extend {\sc RL-LOW} to the setting of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and show, somewhat surprisingly, that the hardness parameter $H$ is unchanged in the asymptotic regime as $n$ tends to infinity; this underscores the inherent efficiency of {\sc RL-LOW} in terms of preserving the privacy of the observed rewards. Given our focus on establishing instance-dependent bounds, our work stands in stark contrast to previous works that focus on establishing worst-case regrets for offline RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Avatar-centric Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon the advent of the emerging metaverse and its related applications in Augmented Reality (AR), the current bit-oriented network struggles to support real-time changes for the vast amount of associated information, hindering its development. Thus, a critical revolution in the Sixth Generation (6G) networks is envisioned through the joint exploitation of information context and its importance to the task, leading to a communication paradigm shift towards semantic and effectiveness levels. However, current research has not yet proposed any explicit and systematic communication framework for AR applications that incorporate these two levels. To fill this research gap, this paper presents a task-oriented and semantics-aware communication framework for augmented reality (TSAR) to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness in 6G. Specifically, we first analyse the traditional wireless AR point cloud communication framework and then summarize our proposed semantic information along with the end-to-end wireless communication. We then detail the design blocks of the TSAR framework, covering both semantic and effectiveness levels. Finally, numerous experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that, compared to the traditional point cloud communication framework, our proposed TSAR significantly reduces wireless AR application transmission latency by 95.6%, while improving communication effectiveness in geometry and color aspects by up to 82.4% and 20.4%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Detection in Noncoherent Massive SIMO Systems over Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communications for industrial internet of things (IIoT), this paper studies the use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise, in which the receiver has statistical channel state information (CSI). We first provide a theoretical analysis on the limitations of unipolar pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy levels, when no (statistical) CSI is available at the transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic approximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic detectors in the large array regime. Finally, we numerically validate it and discuss the outage probability of the system.</description>

      <title>Soft-output (SO) GRAND and Iterative Decoding to Outperform LDPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that a large, flexible class of long, high redundancy error correcting codes can be efficiently and accurately decoded with guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND). Performance evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to construct simple concatenated codes that outperform low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes found in the 5G New Radio standard in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. The concatenated structure enables many desirable features, including: low-complexity hardware-friendly encoding and decoding; significant flexibility in length and rate through modularity; and high levels of parallelism in encoding and decoding that enable low latency.
  Central is the development of a method through which any soft-input (SI) GRAND algorithm can provide soft-output (SO) in the form of an accurate a-posteriori estimate of the likelihood that a decoding is correct or, in the case of list decoding, the likelihood that each element of the list is correct. The distinguishing feature of soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND) is the provision of an estimate that the correct decoding has not been found, even when providing a single decoding. That per-block SO can be converted into accurate per-bit SO by a weighted sum that includes a term for the SI. Implementing SOGRAND adds negligible computation and memory to the existing decoding process, and using it results in a practical, low-latency alternative to LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation: A Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multi-output (MIMO) is now a reality with great potential for further improvement. We study full-duplex transmissions as an effective way to improve mmWave MIMO systems. Compared to half-duplex systems, full-duplex transmissions may offer higher data rates and lower latency. However, full-duplex transmission is hindered by self-interference (SI) at the receive antennas, and SI channel estimation becomes a crucial step to make the full-duplex systems feasible. In this paper, we address the problem of channel estimation in full-duplex mmWave MIMO systems using neural networks (NNs). Our approach involves sharing pilot resources between user equipments (UEs) and transmit antennas at the base station (BS), aiming to reduce the pilot overhead in full-duplex systems and to achieve a comparable level to that of a half-duplex system. Additionally, in the case of separate antenna configurations in a full-duplex BS, providing channel estimates of transmit antenna (TX) arrays to the downlink UEs poses another challenge, as the TX arrays are not capable of receiving pilot signals. To address this, we employ an NN to map the channel from the downlink UEs to the receive antenna (RX) arrays to the channel from the TX arrays to the downlink UEs. We further elaborate on how NNs perform the estimation with different architectures, (e.g., different numbers of hidden layers), the introduction of non-linear distortion (e.g., with a 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)), and different channel conditions (e.g., low-correlated and high-correlated channels). Our work provides novel insights into NN-based channel estimators.</description>

      <title>The Average Spectrum Norm and Near-Optimal Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new tensor norm, the average spectrum norm, to study sample complexity of tensor completion problems based on the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). Properties of the average spectrum norm and its dual norm are investigated, demonstrating their utility for low-rank tensor recovery analysis. Our novel approach significantly reduces the provable sample rate for CPD-based noisy tensor completion, providing the best bounds to date on the number of observed noisy entries required to produce an arbitrarily accurate estimate of an underlying mean value tensor. Under Poisson and Bernoulli multivariate distributions, we show that an $N$-way CPD rank-$R$ parametric tensor $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{M}}\in\mathbb{R}^{I\times \cdots\times I}$ generating noisy observations can be approximated by large likelihood estimators from $\mathcal{O}(IR^2\log^{N+2}(I))$ revealed entries. Furthermore, under nonnegative and orthogonal versions of the CPD we improve the result to depend linearly on the rank, achieving the near-optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(IR\log^{N+2}(I))$.</description>

Abstract: The efficient representation, transmission, and reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) contents are becoming increasingly important for sixth-generation (6G) networks that aim to merge virtual and physical worlds for offering immersive communication experiences. Neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D representation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to provide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore, embracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent solution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the integration of NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G. First, we review the basics of the radiance field rendering techniques, and highlight their applications and implementation challenges over wireless networks. Next, we consider the over-the-air training of NeRF and 3D-GS models over wireless networks by presenting various learning techniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a hierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture, which is suitable for exploiting distributed data and computing resources over 6G networks to train large models representing large-scale scenes. Then, we consider the over-the-air rendering of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We present three practical rendering architectures, namely local, remote, and co-rendering, respectively, and provide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance field models for rendering. We also present rendering acceleration approaches and joint computation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In a case study, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content transmission design.</description>

      <title>Gap-Free Clustering: Sensitivity and Robustness of SDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graph clustering in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) in the presence of both large clusters and small, unrecoverable clusters. Previous convex relaxation approaches achieving exact recovery do not allow any small clusters of size $o(\sqrt{n})$, or require a size gap between the smallest recovered cluster and the largest non-recovered cluster. We provide an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) which removes these requirements and provably recovers large clusters regardless of the remaining cluster sizes. Mid-sized clusters pose unique challenges to the analysis, since their proximity to the recovery threshold makes them highly sensitive to small noise perturbations and precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques, including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can drastically change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue perturbation bounds of potential independent interest. Our results are robust to certain semirandom settings that are challenging for alternative algorithms. Using our gap-free clustering procedure, we obtain efficient algorithms for the problem of clustering with a faulty oracle with superior query complexities, notably achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity even in the presence of a large number of small clusters. Our gap-free clustering procedure also leads to improved algorithms for recursive clustering.</description>
