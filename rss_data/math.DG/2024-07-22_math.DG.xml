      <title>The Rescaled Dirac operator fDh and the noncommutative residue for 6-dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the noncommutative residue for the rescaled Dirac operator fDh on 6-dimensional compact manifolds without boundary. And we give the proof of the Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for the rescaled Dirac operator fDh on 6-dimensional compact manifolds with boundary. We also give some important special cases which can be solved by our calculation methods.</description>

      <title>An invitation to singular foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes attempt to invite the reader towards the theory of singular foliations, both smooth and holomorphic. In addition to a systematic review of the foundations, and an attempt to put in order examples and several elementary constructions, we detail several recent tools developed for non-commutative geometry, in particular the holonomy groupoid of Androulidakis and Skandalis and various methods for resolving singularities. We also introduce various homotopic notions, and end with a series of open questions.</description>

      <title>On a metric symplectization of a contact metric manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate metric structures on the symplectization of a contact metric manifold and prove that there is a unique metric structure, which we call the metric symplectization, for which each slice of the symplectization has a natural induced contact metric structure. We then study the curvature properties of this metric structure and use it to establish equivalent formulations of the $(\kappa, \mu)$-nullity condition in terms of the metric symplectization. We also prove that isomorphisms of the metric symplectizations of $(\kappa, \mu)$-manifolds determine $(\kappa, \mu)$-manifolds up to D-homothetic transformations. These classification results show that the metric symplectization provides a unified framework to classify Sasakian manifolds, K-contact manifolds and $(\kappa, \mu)$-manifolds in terms of their symplectizations.</description>

      <title>On local solubility of Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces related to the geometry of diffeomorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of asymptotic directions for the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed 2-dimensional surface $(\Sigma,g)$ within the full diffeomorphism group, described by the Bao--Ratiu equations, a system of second-order PDEs introduced in [On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993); On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993)]. It is known [The Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 449 (1995)] that asymptotic directions cannot exist globally on any $\Sigma$ with positive curvature. To complement this result, we prove that asymptotic directions always exist locally about a point $x_0 \in \Sigma$ in either of the following cases (where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature on $\Sigma$): (a), $K(x_0)&gt;0$; (b) $K(x_0)&lt;0$; or (c), $K$ changes sign cleanly at $x_0$, i.e., $K(x_0)=0$ and $\nabla K(x_0) \neq 0$. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis following Han [On the isometric embedding of surfaces with Gauss curvature changing sign cleanly, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005)] of a degenerate Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation -- which is of the elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed types in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively -- locally equivalent to the Bao--Ratiu equations.</description>

Abstract: The study of biharmonic submanifolds, initiated by B. Y. Chen and G. Y. Jiang independently, has received a great attention in the past 30 years with many important progress. This note attempts to give a short survey on the study of biharmonic Riemannian submersions which are a dual concept of biharmonic submanifolds (i.e., biharmonic isometric immersions).</description>

      <title>On rigidity of conformal submersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal submersions are generalizations of Riemannian submersions where the differential of the submersion map is a conformal isometry when restricted to the horizontal distribution. Riemannian submersions have been instrumental in the construction of new Riemannian metrics from existing ones. Therefore, being generalizations of Riemannian submersions, conformal submersions are potential tools for constructing new examples of (special) Riemannian manifolds. A conformal submersion is said to be rigid if it reduces to a Riemannian submersion up to homothety. In this paper, we study curvature conditions that force conformal submersions to be rigid. Moreover, under suitable circumstances, using these rigidity criteria for conformal submersions, we conclude the rigidity of certain quasi-Einstein metrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the information-theoretic approach to study curvature-dimension condition, rigidity theorems and entropy differential inequalities on Riemannian manifolds. We prove the equivalence of the ${\rm CD}(K, m)$-condition for $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $m\in [n, \infty]$ and some entropy differential inequalities along the geodesics on the Wasserstein space over a Riemannian manifold. The rigidity models of the entropy differential inequalities are the $K$-Einstein manifolds and the $(K, m)$-Einstein manifolds with Hessian solitons. Moreover, we prove the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy along the geodesics on the Wasserstein space over Riemannian manifolds with CD$(0, m)$-condition. Finally, we compare our work with the synthetic geometry developed by Lott-Villani and Sturm.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we show that the distance function to any finite set $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a topological Morse function, regardless of whether $X$ is in general position. We also precisely characterize its topological critical points and their indices, and relate them to the differential critical points of the function.</description>

      <title>The curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curvature exponent $N_{\mathrm{curv}}$ of a metric measure space is the smallest number $N$ for which the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(0,N)$ holds. In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that $N_{\mathrm{curv}} \geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the corresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian. Furthermore, we show that for every $N\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure on the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\mathrm{curv}}=N$.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\rm k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connect, reductive group over it. Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of complexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$ with integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula of anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\mathbb Q$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion of uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the local classification of singularities of smooth vector fields on the line, with respect to the equivalence relation of $C^1$--conjugacy. Along the way, we recall the analogous classification, up to $C^0$ and $C^{\infty}$ conjugacy. We also give the transversal unfoldings of the corresponding normal forms and treat the case where the changes of coordinates are tangent to the identity. Thus, a fairly complete description of the $1$--d case is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>On the B\"ar-Hijazi-Lott invariant for the Dirac operator and a spinorial proof of the Yamabe problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed spin manifold of dimension $m\geq6$ equipped with a Riemannian metric $\ig$ and a spin structure $\sa$. Let $\lm_1^+(\tilde\ig)$ be the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Dirac operator $D_{\tilde\ig}$ on $M$ with respect to a metric $\tilde\ig$ conformal to $\ig$. The B\"ar-Hijazi-Lott invariant is defined by $\lm_{min}^+(M,\ig,\sa)=\inf_{\tilde\ig\in[\ig]}\lm_1^+(\tilde\ig)\Vol(M,\tilde\ig)^\frac{1}{m}$. In this paper, we show that \[ \lm_{min}^+(M,\ig,\sa)&lt;\lm_{min}^+(S^m,\ig_{S^m},\sa_{S^m})=\frac m2\Vol(S^m,\ig_{S^m})^{\frac1m} \] provided that $\ig$ is not locally conformally flat. This estimate is a spinorial analogue to an estimate by T. Aubin, solving the Yamabe problem in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10636v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a closed oriented manifold or more generally a group homology class, we introduce the spherical Plateau problem, which is a variational problem corresponding to a topological invariant called the spherical volume. In principle, its solutions should be realized by minimal surfaces in quotients of spheres. We explain that in many geometrically interesting cases, those solutions are essentially unique. We start with a review of the Ambrosio-Kirchheim theory of metric currents, and the barycenter map method developed by Besson-Courtois-Gallot. Then, we outline the following applications: (1) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for negatively curved, locally symmetric, closed oriented manifolds, (2) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for all 3-dimensional closed oriented manifolds, (3) the construction of higher-dimensional analogues of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. We also propose some open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt and extend the Montiel-Ros methodology to compact manifolds with boundary, allowing for mixed (including oblique) boundary conditions and also accounting for the action of a finite group $G$ together with an additional twisting homomorphism $\sigma\colon G\to\operatorname O(1)$. We then apply this machinery in order to obtain quantitative lower and upper bounds on the growth rate of the Morse index of free boundary minimal surfaces with respect to the topological data (i. e. the genus and the number of boundary components) of the surfaces in question. In particular, we compute the exact values of the equivariant Morse index and nullity for two infinite families of examples, with respect to their maximal symmetry groups, and thereby derive explicit two-sided linear bounds when the equivariance constraint is lifted.</description>

      <title>Induced almost para-K\"ahler Einstein metrics on cotangent bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier work we have shown that for certain geometric structures on a smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, one obtains an almost para-K\"ahler--Einstein metric on a manifold $A$ of dimension $2n$ associated to the structure on $M$. The geometry also associates a diffeomorphism between $A$ and $T^*M$ to any torsion-free connection compatible with the geometric structure. Hence we can use this construction to associate to each compatible connection an almost para-K\"ahler--Einstein metric on $T^*M$. In this short article, we discuss the relation of these metrics to Patterson--Walker metrics and derive explicit formulae for them in the cases of projective, conformal and Grassmannian structures.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian derivative and the degree of a classical minimal surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Schwarzian derivative we construct a sequence $\left(P_{\ell}\right)_{\ell \geqslant 2}$ of meromorphic differentials on every non-flat oriented minimal surface in Euclidean $3$-space. The differentials $\left(P_{\ell}\right)_{\ell \geqslant 2}$ are invariant under all deformations of the surface arising via the Weierstrass representation and depend on the induced metric and its derivatives only. A minimal surface is said to have degree $n$ if its $n$-th differential is a polynomial expression in the differentials of lower degree. We observe that several well-known minimal surfaces have small degree, including Enneper's surface, the helicoid/catenoid and the Scherk - as well as the Schwarz family. Furthermore, it is shown that locally and away from umbilic points every minimal surface can be approximated by a sequence of minimal surfaces of increasing degree.</description>

      <title>Entropy and stability of hyperbolic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g_0)$ be a closed oriented hyperbolic manifold of dimension at least $3$. By the volume entropy inequality of G. Besson, G. Courtois and S. Gallot, for any Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ with same volume as $g_0$, its volume entropy $h(g)$ satisfies $h(g)\geq n-1$ with equality only when $g$ is isometric to $g_0$. We show that the hyperbolic metric $g_0$ is stable in the following sense: if $g_i$ is a sequence of Riemaniann metrics on $M$ of same volume as $g_0$ and if $h(g_i)$ converges to $n-1$, then there are smooth subsets $Z_i\subset M$ such that both $\mathrm{Vol}(Z_i,g_i)$ and $\mathrm{Area}(\partial Z_i,g_i)$ tend to $0$, and $(M\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $(M,g_0)$ in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The proof relies on showing that any spherical Plateau solution for $M$ is intrinsically isomorphic to $(M,\frac{(n-1)^2}{4n} g_0)$.</description>

      <title>A fixed-point formula for Dirac operators on Lie groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivariant families of Dirac operators on the source fibers of a Lie groupoid with a closed space of units and equipped with an action of an auxiliary compact Lie group. We use the Getzler rescaling method to derive a fixed-point formula for the pairing of a trace with the K-theory class of such a family. For the pair groupoid of a closed manifold, our formula reduces to the standard fixed-point formula for the equivariant index of a Dirac operator. Further examples involve foliations and manifolds equipped with a normal crossing divisor.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to Lefschetz and Morse theory on stratified pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework for Lefschetz fixed point theory and Morse theory for Hilbert complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds. We develop formulas for both global and local Lefschetz numbers and Morse, Poincar\'e polynomials as (polynomial) supertraces over cohomology groups of Hilbert complexes, developing techniques for relating local and global quantities using heat kernel and Witten deformation based methods. We focus on the case where the metric is wedge and the Hilbert complex is associated to a Dirac-type operator and satisfies the Witt condition, constructing Lefschetz versions of Bismut-Cheeger $\mathcal{J}$ forms for local Lefschetz numbers of Dirac operators, with specialized formulas for twisted de Rham, Dolbeault and spin$^{\mathbb{C}}$ Dirac complexes as supertraces of geometric endomorphisms on cohomology groups of local Hilbert complexes. We construct geometric endomorphisms to define de Rham Lefschetz numbers for some self-maps for which the pullback does not induce a bounded operator on $L^2$ forms. A de Rham Witten instanton complex is constructed for Witt spaces with stratified Morse functions, proving Morse inequalities related to other results in the literature including Goresky and MacPherson's in intersection cohomology. We also prove a Lefschetz-Morse inequality for geometric endomorphisms on the instanton complex that is new even on smooth manifolds. We derive $L^2$ Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas, which we compare and contrast with algebraic versions of Baum-Fulton-Quart. In the complex setting, we derive Lefschetz formulas for spin Dirac complexes and Hirzebruch $\chi_y$ genera which we relate to signature, self-dual and anti-self-dual Lefschetz numbers, studying their properties and applications including instanton counting. We compute these invariants in various examples with different features, comparing with versions in other cohomology theories.</description>

      <title>Half-space intersection properties for minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove ``half-space" intersection properties in three settings: the hemisphere, half-geodesic balls in space forms, and certain subsets of Gaussian space. For instance, any two embedded minimal hypersurfaces in the sphere must intersect in every closed hemisphere. Two approaches are developed: one using classifications of stable minimal hypersurfaces, and the second using conformal change and comparison geometry for $\alpha$-Bakry-\'{E}mery-Ricci curvature.
  Our methods yield the analogous intersection properties for free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in space form balls, even when the interior or boundary curvature may be negative.
  Finally, Colding and Minicozzi recently showed that any two embedded shrinkers of dimension $n$ must intersect in a large enough Euclidean ball of radius $R(n)$. We show that $R(n) \leq 2 \sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>On a B-field transform of generalized complex structures over complex tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X^n,\check{X}^n)$ be a mirror pair of an $n$-dimensional complex torus $X^n$ and its mirror partner $\check{X}^n$. Then, by SYZ transform, we can construct a holomorphic line bundle with an integrable connection from each pair of a Lagrangian section of $\check{X}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and a unitary local system along it, and those holomorphic line bundles with integrable connections forms a dg-category $DG_{X^n}$. In this paper, we focus on a certain B-field transform of the generalized complex structure induced from the complex structure on $X^n$, and interpret it as the deformation $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ of $X^n$ by a flat gerbe $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, we construct the deformation of $DG_{X^n}$ associated to the deformation from $X^n$ to $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$, and also discuss the homological mirror symmetry between $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ and its mirror partner on the object level.</description>

      <title>On potentials whose level sets are orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first give a convenient formula for bi-Laplacian on a sphere and the complete description of its eigenvalues, buckling eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenfunctions. We then show that the radial (or rotationally symmetric) solutions for biharmonic equation on the model space $( \mathbb{R}^+\times S^{m-1}, dr^2 + \sigma^2(r)\, g^{S^{m-1}})$ can be given by an integral formula. We also prove that the model space always admits proper biharmonic functions as the products of any eigenfunctions of the factor sphere with certain radial functions. Many explicit examples of proper biharmonic functions on space forms are given. Finally, we give a complete classification of proper biharmonic functions with positive Laplacian on the punctured Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Gluing-at-infinity of two-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review notions of mass of asymptotically locally Anti-de Sitter three-dimensional spacetimes, and apply them to some known solutions. For two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets the mass is not invariant under asymptotic symmetries, but a unique mass parameter can be obtained either by minimisation, or by a monodromy construction, or both. We give an elementary proof of positivity, and of a Penrose-type inequality, in a natural gauge. We apply the "Maskit gluing construction" to time-symmetric asymptotically locally hyperbolic vacuum initial data sets and derive mass/entropy formulae for the resulting manifolds. Finally, we show that all mass aspect functions can be realised by constant scalar curvature metrics on complete manifolds which are smooth except for at most one conical singularity.</description>
