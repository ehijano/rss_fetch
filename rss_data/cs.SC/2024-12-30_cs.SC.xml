      <title>A semi-algebraic model for automatic loop parallelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a semi-algebraic model for automatic parallelization of perfectly nested polynomial loops, which generalizes the classical polyhedral model. This model supports the basic tasks for automatic loop parallelization, such as the representation of the nested loop, the dependence analysis, the computation of valid schedules, as well as the transformation of the loop program with a valid schedule.</description>

      <title>Iterated Resultants and Rational Functions in Real Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds and extends on the authors' previous work related to the algorithmic tool, Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), and one of its core applications, Real Quantifier Elimination (QE). These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic.
  First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints. We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport and England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD. We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum and Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints. We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper.
  We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications. We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative.</description>

      <title>Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric polynomial functions are fundamental questions in mathematics and have various applications in science and engineering. This paper investigates a beautiful and inspiring conjecture, proposed by Cuttler, Greene and Skandera in 2011, on inequalities among the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial function $H_{n,\lambda}$: It states that the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$ implies majorization order $\lambda\preceq\mu$. The conjecture is a close analogy with other known results on Muirhead-type inequalities. In 2021, Heaton and Shankar disproved the conjecture by showing a counterexample for number of variables $n=3$ and degree $d=8$. They then asked whether the conjecture is true when $n$ is sufficiently large. In this paper, we show, by a family of counter-examples, that the conjecture does not hold for any $n$ and any $d$ as long as $n\geq2$ and $d\geq8$. Based on the insights gained from the counter-examples, we propose a new conjecture for the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$.</description>
