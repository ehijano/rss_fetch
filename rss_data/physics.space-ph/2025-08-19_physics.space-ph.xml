      <title>Real-time prediction of geomagnetic storms using Solar Orbiter as a far upstream solar wind monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first real-time predictions of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic structure and resulting geomagnetic impact at Earth for two events using far-upstream observations from Solar Orbiter during March 2024. Despite the large heliocentric distance between measurement at Solar Orbiter and L1 (0.53 and 0.60 AU), our predicted magnetic structures closely matched subsequent observations. Geomagnetic index predictions were made in real-time with 7 and 15 hour lead-times, presenting a large improvement over current L1-based warning times of less than one hour. We successfully captured the observed geomagnetic response profiles, although underestimated the intensity of the storm during already disturbed conditions. Our results show that predictions with high accuracy and actionable lead-times can be made with far upstream spacecraft, even with longitudinal separations up to 10{\deg} from the Sun-Earth line, over heliocentric distance ranges where radial evolution effects dominate over longitudinal effects. Our findings demonstrate the substantial value of real-time upstream solar wind measurements for enhancing geomagnetic forecasting accuracy at Earth and provide critical validation for future dedicated upstream space weather missions.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation</title>

Abstract: Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.</description>

      <title>Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A validation strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. We review the strategy primary elements, including the emergence of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The article highlights biological effects of radiation exposure influenced by altitude, latitude, and geomagnetic conditions, upon aircrew, frequent flyers, and commercial space travelers. It recognizes the SWAG user needs survey report that identifies the need for continuous monitoring and predictive models to ensure long-term occupational and public health safety. The ALARA strategy validation was completed using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit. One flight occurred during the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for shielding to reduce dose. One approach is fly lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is fly lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management. This study shows the effectiveness to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding reduces radiation hazard risks.</description>
