      <title>Approximation by matrix transform means with respect to the Walsh system in Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve, complement and generalize (from N\"or\-lund to matrix transform means) a result of M\'oricz and Siddiqi \cite{MS} and some statements of Areshidze and Tephnadze \cite{AT}, and (from $T$ (weighted) to matrix transform means) Anakidze, Areshidze, Persson and Tephnadze \cite{AAPT}.</description>

      <title>Representations of the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant deduced from integrals due to F\'eaux and Kummer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two integral representations of the logarithm of the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant. The calculations are based on definite integral expressions of $\log\Gamma(x)$, $\Gamma$ being the usual Gamma function, due respectively to F\'eaux and Kummer. The connection between the second formula and an infinite series expansion of the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant is also outlined.</description>

      <title>Series associated with a forgotten identity of N\"orlund</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a seemingly forgotten series expression of N\"orlund for the psi function to express infinite series involving inverse factorials in closed form. Many of such series contain products of Catalan numbers and (odd) harmonic numbers. We also prove some new series for $\pi$.</description>

      <title>On merge trees with a given homological sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the induced homological sequence and the induced merge tree of a discrete Morse function on a tree. A discrete Morse function on a tree gives rise to a sequence of Betti numbers that keep track of the number of components at each critical value. A discrete Morse function on a tree also gives rise to an induced merge tree which keeps track of component birth, death, and merging information. These topological indicators are similar but neither one contains the information of the other. We show that given a merge tree and a homological sequence along with some mild conditions on their relationship, there is a discrete Morse function on a tree that induces both the given merge tree and the given homological sequence.</description>

      <title>The characterization of general pseudo-homogeneous t-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article first introduces the concept of a general pseudo-homogeneous triangular norm. It then gives some properties of general pseudo-homogeneous triangular norms. Finally, it characterizes all general pseudo-homogeneous triangular norms completely.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Determinants of Fibonacci-Hessenberg-Lorentz Matrices and Special Number Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research aims to construct a new type of matrix called the Fibonacci-Hessenberg-Lorentz matrix by multiplying Fibonacci-Hessenberg matrices with Lorentz matrix multiplication. The study will start by examining the properties of Hessenberg and tridiagonal matrices and then focus on developing the Fibonacci-Hessenberg matrix using Fibonacci sequences. By multiplication it with a Lorentz matrix multiplication, the resulting matrix, the Fibonacci-Hessenberg-Lorentz matrix, will be analyzed to obtain special number sequences through its determinants for n&gt;=1. The primary objective is to explore whether the determinants of these matrices can generate new or known number sequences, where the elements are expressed as functions of the matrix parameters. Furthermore, the research will attempt to generalize these sequences of using Fibonacci numbers to establish a generalized formula for their terms. Ultimately, the goal is to derive a mathematical representation that connects the characteristics of the newly defined matrices to well-known special sequences in mathematics.</description>

      <title>Complex Circles of Partition and the Expansion Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we further develop the theory of circles of partition by introducing the notion of complex circles of partition. This work generalizes the classical framework, extending from subsets of the natural numbers as base sets to partitions defined within the complex plane, which now serves as both the base and bearing set. We employ the squeeze principle as a central tool for rigorously investigating the possibility to partition numbers with base set as a certain subset of the complex plane.</description>
