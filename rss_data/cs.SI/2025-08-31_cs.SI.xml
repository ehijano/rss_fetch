      <title>Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations -- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood, work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However, after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting.</description>

      <title>Feminism, gender identity and polarization in TikTok and Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of social media to create open, collaborative and participatory spaces allows young women to engage and empower themselves in political and social activism. In this context, the objective of this research is to analyze the polarization in the debate at the intersection between the defense of feminism and transsexuality, preferably among the young population, symbolized in the use of the term 'TERF'. To do this, the existing communities on this subject on Twitter and TikTok have been analyzed with Social Network Analysis techniques, in addition to the presence of young people in them. The results indicate that the debates between both networks are not very cohesive, with a highly modularized structure that suggests isolation of each community. For this reason, it may be considered that the debate on sexual identity has resulted in a strong polarization of feminist activism in social media. Likewise, the positions of transinclusive feminism are very much in the majority among young people; this reinforces the idea of an ideological debate that can also be understood from a generational perspective. Finally, differential use between both social networks has been identified, where TikTok is a less partisan and more dialogue-based network than Twitter, which leads to discussions and participation in a more neutral tone.</description>

      <title>LLM-Supported Content Analysis of Motivated Reasoning on Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public discourse around climate change remains polarized despite scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change (ACC). This study examines how "believers" and "skeptics" of ACC differ in their YouTube comment discourse. We analyzed 44,989 comments from 30 videos using a large language model (LLM) as a qualitative annotator, identifying ten distinct topics. These annotations were combined with social network analysis to examine engagement patterns. A linear mixed-effects model showed that comments about government policy and natural cycles generated significantly lower interaction compared to misinformation, suggesting these topics are ideologically settled points within communities. These patterns reflect motivated reasoning, where users selectively engage with content that aligns with their identity and beliefs. Our findings highlight the utility of LLMs for large-scale qualitative analysis and highlight how climate discourse is shaped not only by content, but by underlying cognitive and ideological motivations.</description>

      <title>Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Operational Validation of Large-Language-Model Agent Social Simulation: Evidence from Voat v/technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative social simulations that can capture culturally informed, norm-guided interaction on online social platforms. We build a technology community simulation modeled on Voat, a Reddit-like alt-right news aggregator and discussion platform active from 2014 to 2020. Using the YSocial framework, we seed the simulation with a fixed catalog of technology links sampled from Voat's shared URLs (covering 30+ domains) and calibrate parameters to Voat's v/technology using samples from the MADOC dataset. Agents use a base, uncensored model (Dolphin 3.0, based on Llama 3.1 8B) and concise personas (demographics, political leaning, interests, education, toxicity propensity) to generate posts, replies, and reactions under platform rules for link and text submissions, threaded replies and daily activity cycles. We run a 30-day simulation and evaluate operational validity by comparing distributions and structures with matched Voat data: activity patterns, interaction networks, toxicity, and topic coverage. Results indicate familiar online regularities: similar activity rhythms, heavy-tailed participation, sparse low-clustering interaction networks, core-periphery structure, topical alignment with Voat, and elevated toxicity. Limitations of the current study include the stateless agent design and evaluation based on a single 30-day run, which constrains external validity and variance estimates. The simulation generates realistic discussions, often featuring toxic language, primarily centered on technology topics such as Big Tech and AI. This approach offers a valuable method for examining toxicity dynamics and testing moderation strategies within a controlled environment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Instance-Optimal Cluster Recovery in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of recovering hidden communities in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model (LSBM) with a finite number of clusters whose sizes grow linearly with the total number of nodes. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected number of misclassified nodes is less than $ s $, for any number $ s = o(n) $. To achieve this, we propose IAC (Instance-Adaptive Clustering), the first algorithm whose performance matches the instance-specific lower bounds both in expectation and with high probability. IAC is a novel two-phase algorithm that consists of a one-shot spectral clustering step followed by iterative likelihood-based cluster assignment improvements. This approach is based on the instance-specific lower bound and notably does not require any knowledge of the model parameters, including the number of clusters. By performing the spectral clustering only once, IAC maintains an overall computational complexity of $ \mathcal{O}(n\, \text{polylog}(n)) $, making it scalable and practical for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Mixed membership estimation for categorical data with weighted responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grade of Membership (GoM) model, which allows subjects to belong to multiple latent classes, is a powerful tool for inferring latent classes in categorical data. However, its application is limited to categorical data with nonnegative integer responses, as it assumes that the response matrix is generated from Bernoulli or Binomial distributions, making it inappropriate for datasets with continuous or negative weighted responses. To address this, this paper proposes a novel model named the Weighted Grade of Membership (WGoM) model. Our WGoM is more general than GoM because it relaxes GoM's distribution constraint by allowing the response matrix to be generated from distributions like Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal, and Uniform as long as the expected response matrix has a block structure related to subjects' mixed memberships under the distribution. We show that WGoM can describe any response matrix with finite distinct elements. We then propose an algorithm to estimate the latent mixed memberships and other WGoM parameters. We derive the error bounds of the estimated parameters and show that the algorithm is statistically consistent. We also propose an efficient method for determining the number of latent classes $K$ for categorical data with weighted responses by maximizing fuzzy weighted modularity. The performance of our methods is validated through both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm for estimating latent mixed memberships, as well as the high accuracy of our method for estimating $K$, indicating their high potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Antivaccine Tweets on COVID-19 Vaccinations, Cases, and Deaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States and their effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations and mortality during the pandemic, a majority of Americans chose not to be vaccinated during 2021. Recent work shows that vaccine misinformation affects intentions in controlled settings, but does not link it to real-world vaccination rates. Here, we present observational evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to antivaccine content and vaccination rates, and estimate the size of this effect. We present a compartmental epidemic model that includes vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and exposure to antivaccine content. We fit the model to data to determine that a geographical pattern of exposure to online antivaccine content across US counties explains reduced vaccine uptake in the same counties. We find observational evidence that exposure to antivaccine content on Twitter caused about 14,000 people to refuse vaccination between February and August 2021 in the US, resulting in at least 510 additional cases and 8 additional deaths. This work provides a methodology for linking online speech with offline epidemic outcomes. Our findings should inform social media moderation policy as well as public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted polarisation and information reliability in climate change discussions on social media platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter play a key role in disseminating both reliable and unreliable information about climate change. This study analyses the topology of interactions in Twitter and their relation to cross-platform sharing, content discussions and emotional responses. We examined climate change discussions across four topics: the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate refugees, and Do\~nana Natural Park. While retweets reinforce in-group cohesion in the form of echo chambers, inter-group exposure is significant through mentions, suggesting that exposure to opposing views intensifies polarisation, rather than mitigates it. Ideological divides feature content differences accompanied by steeper negative sentiments, especially from right-leaning communities prone to share low-reliability information. We identified a topological alignment between platforms, indicating that ideological communities span multiple sites. Our findings show that climate change polarisation is multifaceted, involving ideological divides, structural isolation, and emotional engagement. These results suggest that effective climate policy discussions must address the emotional and identity-driven nature of public discourse and seek strategies to bridge ideological divides.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Multidimensional Opinions with Topic-Weighted Discordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions on a wide range of topics often evolve over time through their interactions with others. Models of opinion dynamics primarily focus on one-dimensional opinions, which represent opinions on one topic. However, opinions on various topics are rarely isolated; instead, they can be interdependent and correlated. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, agents are receptive to each other only if their opinions are sufficiently similar. We extend classical agent-based BCMs -- namely, the Hegselmann--Krause BCM, which has synchronous interactions, and the Deffuant--Weisbuch BCM, which has asynchronous interactions -- to a multidimensional setting, in which the opinions are multidimensional vectors representing opinions of different topics and opinions on different topics are interdependent. To measure opinion differences between agents, we introduce topic-weighted discordance functions that account for opinion differences in all topics. We define regions of receptiveness for our models, and we use them to characterize the steady-state opinion clusters and provide an analytical approach to compute these regions. In addition, we numerically simulate our models on various networks with initial opinions drawn from a variety of distributions. When initial opinions are correlated across different topics, our topic-weighted BCMs yield significantly different results in both transient and steady states compared to baseline models, where the dynamics of each opinion topic are independent.</description>
