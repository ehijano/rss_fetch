      <title>Boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous analysis on boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on Lipschitz polyhedra. The magnetic field integral equation is widely used in practical applications to model electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting body. The governing operator is shown to be coercive by means of the electric field integral operator with a purely imaginary wave number. Consequently, the continuous variational problem is uniquely solvable, given that the wave number does not belong to the spectrum of the interior Maxwell's problem. A Galerkin discretization scheme is then introduced, employing Raviart-Thomas basis functions for the solution space and Buffa-Christiansen functions for the test space. A discrete inf-sup condition is proven, implying the unique solvability of the discrete variational problem. An asymptotically quasi-optimal error estimate for the numerical solutions is established, and the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is examined. In addition, the resulting matrix system is shown to be well-conditioned regardless of the mesh refinement. Some numerical results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A Construction of Interpolating Space Curves with Any Degree of Geometric Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines a methodology for constructing a geometrically smooth interpolatory curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ applicable to oriented and flattenable points with $d\ge 2$. The construction involves four essential components: local functions, blending functions, redistributing functions, and gluing functions. The resulting curve possesses favorable attributes, including $G^2$ geometric smoothness, locality, the absence of cusps, and no self-intersection. Moreover, the algorithm is adaptable to various scenarios, such as preserving convexity, interpolating sharp corners, and ensuring sphere preservation. The paper substantiates the efficacy of the proposed method through the presentation of numerous numerical examples, offering a practical demonstration of its capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of Square Roots and Inverse Square Roots of Gram Matrices for Surface Integral Equations in Electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface integral equations (SIEs)-based boundary element methods are widely used for analyzing electromagnetic scattering scenarii. However, after discretization of SIEs, the spectrum and eigenvectors of the boundary element matrices are not usually representative of the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the underlying surface integral operators, which can be problematic for methods that rely heavily on spectral properties. To address this issue, we delineate some efficient algorithms that allow for the computation of matrix square roots and inverse square roots of the Gram matrices corresponding to the discretization scheme, which can be used for revealing the spectrum of standard electromagnetic integral operators. The algorithms, which are based on properly chosen expansions of the square root and inverse square root functions, are quite effective when applied to several of the most relevant Gram matrices used for boundary element discretizations in electromagnetics. Tables containing different sets of expansion coefficients are provided along with comparative numerical experiments that evidence advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. In addition, to demonstrate the spectrum-revealing properties of the proposed techniques, they are applied to the discretization of the problem of scattering by a sphere for which the analytic spectrum is known.</description>

      <title>A fast and robust discrete FFT-based solver for computational homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new discrete FFT-based method for computational homogenization of micromechanics on a regular grid that is simple, fast and robust. The discretization scheme is based on a tetrahedral stencil that displays three crucial properties. First, and most importantly, the Fourier representation of the associated Green operator is defined for any finite q-vector generated by the periodic boundary conditions and that does not belong to the Reciprocal Lattice of the discrete grids. As shown in the paper, this property guaranties that, for any elastic contrats, even infinite, mechanical equilibrium is always mathematically stable, i.e. free of any unphysical patterns, such as oscillations, ringing or checkerboarding, a property which is not shared by the original Moulinec-Suquet method \cite{moulinec1994fast,moulinec1998numerical} nor by the rotated scheme proposed by Willot \cite{willot2015fourier}. Second, the components of tensorial quantities are all defined on the same location, which permits the use of any elastic anisotropy and any spatial variation of the material fields. Third, convergence to equilibrium using the simplest iterative scheme, the "basic scheme", is fast and the number of iterates stabilizes at high contrasts, so that infinite contrast is obtained without additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>A robust solver for H(curl) convection-diffusion and its local Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and efficient multigrid solver based on an exponential-fitting discretization for 2D H(curl) convection-diffusion problems. By leveraging an exponential identity, we characterize the kernel of H(curl) convection-diffusion problems and design a suitable hybrid smoother. This smoother incorporates a lexicographic Gauss-Seidel smoother within a downwind type and smoothing over an auxiliary problem, corresponding to H(grad) convection-diffusion problems for kernel correction. We analyze the convergence properties of the smoothers and the two-level method using local Fourier analysis (LFA). The performance of the algorithms demonstrates robustness in both convection-dominated and diffusion-dominated cases.</description>

      <title>A class of new linear, efficient and high-order implicit-explicit methods for the coupled free flow-porous media system based on nonlinear Lions interface condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze new first- and second-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes for the unsteady Navier-Stokes-Darcy model to describe the coupled free flow-porous media system, which is based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach in time and finite element method in space. The constructed schemes are linear, only require solving a sequence of linear differential equations with constant coefficients at each time step, and can decouple the Navier-Stokes and Darcy systems. The unconditional stability of both the first- and second-order IMEX schemes can be derived for the coupled system equipped with the Lions interface condition, where the key point is that we should construct a new trilinear form to balance the fully explicit discretizations of the nonlinear terms in the complex system. We can also establish rigorous error estimates for the velocity and hydraulic head of the first-order scheme without any time step restriction. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Lowest-order Nonstandard Finite Element Methods for Time-Fractional Biharmonic Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an initial-boundary value problem for a time-fractional biharmonic equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with clamped boundary conditions. After establishing the well-posedness, we focus on some regularity results of the solution with respect to the regularity of the problem data. The spatially semidiscrete scheme covers several popular lowest-order piecewise-quadratic finite element schemes, namely, Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and $C^0$ interior penalty methods, and includes both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. Optimal order error bounds with respect to the regularity assumptions on the data are proved for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous problems. The numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence rate results.</description>

      <title>Optimal recovery of linear operators from information of random functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns problems of the recovery of linear operators defined on sets of functions from information of these functions given with stochastic errors. The constructed optimal recovery methods, in general, do not use all the available information. As a consequence, optimal methods are obtained for recovering derivatives of functions from Sobolev classes by the information of their Fourier transforms given with stochastic errors. A similar problem is considered for solutions of the heat equation.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Three-Layer Neural Network Trained with PGD for Deep Ritz Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is a rapidly advancing field with diverse applications across various domains. One prominent area of research is the utilization of deep learning techniques for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this work, we specifically focus on employing a three-layer tanh neural network within the framework of the deep Ritz method(DRM) to solve second-order elliptic equations with three different types of boundary conditions. We perform projected gradient descent(PDG) to train the three-layer network and we establish its global convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive error analysis of using overparameterized networks to solve PDE problems, as our analysis simultaneously includes estimates for approximation error, generalization error, and optimization error. We present error bound in terms of the sample size $n$ and our work provides guidance on how to set the network depth, width, step size, and number of iterations for the projected gradient descent algorithm. Importantly, our assumptions in this work are classical and we do not require any additional assumptions on the solution of the equation. This ensures the broad applicability and generality of our results.</description>

      <title>Efficient absorbing boundary conditions for conservation laws: Application to the piston problem of gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the imposition of outflow boundary conditions for one-dimensional conservation laws. While a highly accurate numerical solution can be obtained in the interior of the domain, boundary discretization can lead to unphysical reflections. We investigate and implement some classes of relaxation methods and far-field operators to deal with this problem without significantly increasing the size of the computational domain. Relations are established between these techniques, and extensions of them are explored. In particular, we introduce a simple and robust relaxation method with a matrix-valued weight function that selectively absorbs outgoing waves. As a challenging model problem, we consider the Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations for an isotropic gas with inflow boundary conditions determined by an oscillating piston.</description>

      <title>Density functions for the overdamped generalized Langevin equation and its Euler--Maruyama method: smoothness and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the convergence rate of the density function of the Euler--Maruyama (EM) method, when applied to the overdamped generalized Langevin equation with fractional noise which serves as an important model in many fields. Firstly, we give an improved upper bound estimate for the total variation distance between random variables by their Malliavin--Sobolev norms. Secondly, we establish the existence and smoothness of the density function for both the exact solution and the numerical one. Based on the above results, the convergence rate of the density function of the numerical solution is obtained, which relies on the regularity of the noise and kernel. This convergence result provides a powerful support for numerically capturing the statistical information of the exact solution through the EM method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraspherical spectral method features high accuracy and fast solution. In this article, we determine the sources of error arising from the ultraspherical spectral method and derive its effective condition number, which explains why its backward error is consistent with a numerical method with bounded condition number. In addition, we show the cause for the Cauchy error to go below the machine epsilon and decay eventually to exact zero, revealing the fact that the Cauchy error can be misleading when used as an indicator of convergence and accuracy. The analysis in this work can be readily extended to other spectral methods, when applicable, and to the solution of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Two new calibration techniques of lumped-parameter mathematical models for the cardiovascular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiocirculatory mathematical models serve as valuable tools for investigating physiological and pathological conditions of the circulatory system. To investigate the clinical condition of an individual, cardiocirculatory models need to be personalized by means of calibration methods. In this study we propose a new calibration method for a lumped-parameter cardiocirculatory model. This calibration method utilizes the correlation matrix between parameters and model outputs to calibrate the latter according to data. We test this calibration method and its combination with L-BFGS-B (Limited memory Broyden - Fletcher - Goldfarb - Shanno with Bound constraints) comparing them with the performances of L-BFGS-B alone. We show that the correlation matrix calibration method and the combined one effectively reduce the loss function of the associated optimization problem. In the case of in silico generated data, we show that the two new calibration methods are robust with respect to the initial guess of parameters and to the presence of noise in the data. Notably, the correlation matrix calibration method achieves the best results in estimating the parameters in the case of noisy data and it is faster than the combined calibration method and L-BFGS-B. Finally, we present real test case where the two new calibration methods yield results comparable to those obtained using L-BFGS-B in terms of minimizing the loss function and estimating the clinical data. This highlights the effectiveness of the new calibration methods for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal balanced-norm error estimate of the LDG method for reaction-diffusion problems II: the two-dimensional case with layer-upwind flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method. Typical solutions of this class of problem exhibit boundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause difficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers by using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a ``layer-upwind flux" -- a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine mesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer weakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty terms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG method. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an optimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the usual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed solutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be proved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\ln N)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of degree~$k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result is the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem and is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Subspace embedding with random Khatri-Rao products and its application to eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various iterative eigenvalue solvers have been developed to compute parts of the spectrum for a large sparse matrix, including the power method, Krylov subspace methods, contour integral methods, and preconditioned solvers such as the so called LOBPCG method. All of these solvers rely on random matrices to determine, e.g., starting vectors that have, with high probability, a non-negligible overlap with the eigenvectors of interest. For this purpose, a safe and common choice are unstructured Gaussian random matrices. In this work, we investigate the use of random Khatri-Rao products in eigenvalue solvers. On the one hand, we establish a novel subspace embedding property that provides theoretical justification for the use of such structured random matrices. On the other hand, we highlight the potential algorithmic benefits when solving eigenvalue problems with Kronecker product structure, as they arise frequently from the discretization of eigenvalue problems for differential operators on tensor product domains. In particular, we consider the use of random Khatri-Rao products within a contour integral method and LOBPCG. Numerical experiments indicate that the gains for the contour integral method strongly depend on the ability to efficiently and accurately solve (shifted) matrix equations with low-rank right-hand side. The flexibility of LOBPCG to directly employ preconditioners makes it easier to benefit from Khatri-Rao product structure, at the expense of having less theoretical justification.</description>

      <title>Discrete approximations of Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11317v7 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of approximating the Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivative computations in scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data.
  We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Difference method with a posteriori limiting: II- Application to low Mach number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar convection poses two main gargantuan challenges for astrophysical fluid solvers: low-Mach number flows and minuscule perturbations over steeply stratified hydrostatic equilibria. Most methods exhibit excessive numerical diffusion and are unable to capture the correct solution due to large truncation errors. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the Spectral Difference (SD) method under these extreme conditions using an arbitrarily high-order shock capturing scheme with a posteriori limiting. We include both a modification to the HLLC Riemann solver adapted to low Mach number flows (L-HLLC) and a well-balanced scheme to properly evolve perturbations over steep equilibrium solutions. We evaluate the performance of our method using a series of test tailored specifically for stellar convection. We observe that our high-order SD method is capable of dealing with very subsonic flows without necessarily using the modified Riemann solver. We find however that the well-balanced framework is unavoidable if one wants to capture accurately small amplitude convective and acoustic modes. Analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy, we show that our fourth-order SD scheme seems to emerge as an optimal variant to solve this difficult numerical problem.</description>

      <title>What are You Weighting For? Improved Weights for Gaussian Mixture Filtering With Application to Cislunar Orbit Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the critical aspect of accurate weight computation during the measurement incorporation phase of Gaussian mixture filters. The proposed novel approach computes weights by linearizing the measurement model about each component's posterior estimate rather than the the prior, as traditionally done. This work proves equivalence with traditional methods for linear models, provides novel sigma-point extensions to the traditional and proposed methods, and empirically demonstrates improved performance in nonlinear cases. Two illustrative examples, the Avocado and a cislunar single target tracking scenario, serve to highlight the advantages of the new weight computation technique by analyzing filter accuracy and consistency through varying the number of Gaussian mixture components.</description>

      <title>Flattened one-bit stochastic gradient descent: compressed distributed optimization with controlled variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with compressed gradient communication in the parameter-server framework. Our gradient compression technique, named flattened one-bit stochastic gradient descent (FO-SGD), relies on two simple algorithmic ideas: (i) a one-bit quantization procedure leveraging the technique of dithering, and (ii) a randomized fast Walsh-Hadamard transform to flatten the stochastic gradient before quantization. As a result, the approximation of the true gradient in this scheme is biased, but it prevents commonly encountered algorithmic problems, such as exploding variance in the one-bit compression regime, deterioration of performance in the case of sparse gradients, and restrictive assumptions on the distribution of the stochastic gradients. In fact, we show SGD-like convergence guarantees under mild conditions. The compression technique can be used in both directions of worker-server communication, therefore admitting distributed optimization with full communication compression.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo Using Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an efficient approach for accelerating multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for large-scale problems using low-fidelity machine learning models. While conventional techniques for large-scale Bayesian inference often substitute computationally expensive high-fidelity models with machine learning models, thereby introducing approximation errors, our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative by augmenting high-fidelity models with low-fidelity ones within a hierarchical framework. The multilevel approach utilizes the low-fidelity machine learning model (MLM) for inexpensive evaluation of proposed samples thereby improving the acceptance of samples by the high-fidelity model. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is derived from geometric multigrid hierarchy. We utilize an MLM to acclerate the coarse level sampling. Training machine learning model for the coarsest level significantly reduces the computational cost associated with generating training data and training the model. We present an MCMC algorithm to accelerate the coarsest level sampling using MLM and account for the approximation error introduced. We provide theoretical proofs of detailed balance and demonstrate that our multilevel approach constitutes a consistent MCMC algorithm. Additionally, we derive conditions on the accuracy of the machine learning model to facilitate more efficient hierarchical sampling. Our technique is demonstrated on a standard benchmark inference problem in groundwater flow, where we estimate the probability density of a quantity of interest using a four-level MCMC algorithm. Our proposed algorithm accelerates multilevel sampling by a factor of two while achieving similar accuracy compared to sampling using the standard multilevel algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>A New Cross-Space Total Variation Regularization Model for Color Image Restoration with Quaternion Blur Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces.
  The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbors GParareal: Improving Scalability of Gaussian Processes for Parallel-in-Time Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of supercomputers, multi-processor environments and parallel-in-time (PinT) algorithms offer ways to solve initial value problems for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) over long time intervals, a task often unfeasible with sequential solvers within realistic time frames. A recent approach, GParareal, combines Gaussian Processes with traditional PinT methodology (Parareal) to achieve faster parallel speed-ups. The method is known to outperform Parareal for low-dimensional ODEs and a limited number of computer cores. Here, we present Nearest Neighbors GParareal (nnGParareal), a novel data-enriched PinT integration algorithm. nnGParareal builds upon GParareal by improving its scalability properties for higher-dimensional systems and increased processor count. Through data reduction, the model complexity is reduced from cubic to log-linear in the sample size, yielding a fast and automated procedure to integrate initial value problems over long time intervals. First, we provide both an upper bound for the error and theoretical details on the speed-up benefits. Then, we empirically illustrate the superior performance of nnGParareal, compared to GParareal and Parareal, on nine different systems with unique features (e.g., stiff, chaotic, high-dimensional, or challenging-to-learn systems).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite Difference methods (FD) are one of the oldest and simplest methods for solving partial differential equations (PDE). Block Finite Difference methods (BFD) are FD methods in which the domain is divided into blocks, or cells, containing two or more grid points, with a different scheme used for each grid point, unlike the standard FD method.
  It was shown in recent works that BFD schemes might be one to three orders more accurate than their truncation errors. Due to these schemes' ability to inhibit the accumulation of truncation errors, these methods were called Error Inhibiting Schemes (EIS).
  This manuscript shows that our BFD schemes can be viewed as a particular type of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Then, we prove the BFD scheme's stability using the standard DG procedure while using a Fourier-like analysis to establish its optimal convergence rate.
  We present numerical examples in one and two dimensions to demonstrate the efficacy of these schemes.</description>

Abstract: Among randomized numerical linear algebra strategies, so-called sketching procedures are emerging as effective reduction means to accelerate the computation of Krylov subspace methods for, e.g., the solution of linear systems, eigenvalue computations, and the approximation of matrix functions. While there is plenty of experimental evidence showing that sketched Krylov solvers may dramatically improve performance over standard Krylov methods, many features of these schemes are still unexplored. We derive a new sketched Arnoldi-type relation that allows us to obtain several different new theoretical results. These lead to an improvement of our understanding of sketched Krylov methods, and to identifying, among several possible equivalent formulations, the most suitable sketched approximations according to their numerical stability properties. These results are also employed to analyze the error of sketched Krylov methods in the approximation of the action of matrix functions, significantly contributing to the theory available in the current literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian statistical framework provides a systematic approach to enhance the regularization model by incorporating prior information about the desired solution. For the Bayesian linear inverse problems with Gaussian noise and Gaussian prior, we propose a new iterative regularization algorithm that belongs to subspace projection regularization (SPR) methods. By treating the forward model matrix as a linear operator between the two underlying finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with new introduced inner products, we first introduce an iterative process that can generate a series of valid solution subspaces. The SPR method then projects the original problem onto these solution subspaces to get a series of low dimensional linear least squares problems, where an efficient procedure is developed to update the solutions of them to approximate the desired solution of the original problem. With the new designed early stopping rules, this iterative algorithm can obtain a regularized solution with a satisfied accuracy. Several theoretical results about the algorithm are established to reveal the regularization properties of it. We use both small-scale and large-scale inverse problems to test the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its robustness and efficiency. The most computationally intensive operations in the proposed algorithm only involve matrix-vector products, making it highly efficient for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Derivative-informed neural operator acceleration of geometric MCMC for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an operator learning approach to accelerate geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for solving infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). While geometric MCMC employs high-quality proposals that adapt to posterior local geometry, it requires repeated computations of gradients and Hessians of the log-likelihood, which becomes prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is defined through expensive-to-solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider a delayed-acceptance geometric MCMC method driven by a neural operator surrogate of the PtO map, where the proposal exploits fast surrogate predictions of the log-likelihood and, simultaneously, its gradient and Hessian. To achieve a substantial speedup, the surrogate must accurately approximate the PtO map and its Jacobian, which often demands a prohibitively large number of PtO map samples via conventional operator learning methods. In this work, we present an extension of derivative-informed operator learning [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] that uses joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. This leads to derivative-informed neural operator (DINO) surrogates that accurately predict the observables and posterior local geometry at a significantly lower training cost than conventional methods. Cost and error analysis for reduced basis DINO surrogates are provided. Numerical studies demonstrate that DINO-driven MCMC generates effective posterior samples 3--9 times faster than geometric MCMC and 60--97 times faster than prior geometry-based MCMC. Furthermore, the training cost of DINO surrogates breaks even compared to geometric MCMC after just 10--25 effective posterior samples.</description>

Abstract: Starting from an A-stable rational approximation to $\rm{e}^z$ of order $p$, $$r(z)= 1+ z+ \cdots + z^p/ p! + O(z^{p+1}),$$ families of stable methods are proposed to time discretize abstract IVP's of the type $u'(t) = A u(t) + f(t)$. These numerical procedures turn out to be of order $p$, thus overcoming the order reduction phenomenon, and only one evaluation of $f$ per step is required.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Computation of Morphological Complexity in the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reductions of the self-consistent mean field theory model of amphiphilic molecules in solvent can lead to a singular family of functionalized Cahn-Hilliard energies. We modify these energies, mollifying the singularities to stabilize the computation of the gradient flows and develop a series of benchmark problems that emulate the "morphological complexity" observed in experiments. These benchmarks investigate the delicate balance between the rate of absorption of amphiphilic material onto an interface and a least energy mechanism to disperse the arriving mass. The result is a trichotomy of responses in which two-dimensional interfaces either lengthen by a regularized motion against curvature, undergo pearling bifurcations, or split directly into networks of interfaces. We evaluate a number of schemes that use second order BDF2-type time stepping coupled with Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization. The BDF2-type schemes are either based on a fully implicit time discretization with a PSD nonlinear solver, or upon IMEX, SAV, ETD approaches. All schemes use a fixed local truncation error target with adaptive time-stepping to achieve the error target. Each scheme requires proper "preconditioning" to achieve robust performance that can enhance efficiency by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized Boussinesq equation as a model for the water wave problem with surface tension. Initially, we investigate the initial value problem within Sobolev spaces, deriving conditions under which solutions are either global or experience blow-up in time. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to Bessel potential and modulation spaces, determining the asymptotic behavior of solutions. We establish the non-existence of solitary waves for certain parameters using Pohozaev-type identities. Additionally, we numerically generate solitary wave solutions of the generalized Boussinesq equation through the Petviashvili iteration method. To further examine the time evolution of solutions, we propose employing the Fourier pseudo-spectral numerical method. Our investigation extends to the gap interval, where neither global existence nor blow-up results have been theoretically established. We find that our numerical results effectively fill these gaps, supplementing the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver for Learning PDEs via Probabilistic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines.

      <title>On the connections between optimization algorithms, Lyapunov functions, and differential equations: theory and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the general framework introduced by Fazylab et al. (SIAM J. Optim. 28, 2018) to construct Lyapunov functions for optimization algorithms in discrete and continuous time. For smooth, strongly convex objective functions, we relax the requirements necessary for such a construction. As a result we are able to prove for Polyak's ordinary differential equations and for a two-parameter family of Nesterov algorithms rates of convergence that improve on those available in the literature. We analyse the interpretation of Nesterov algorithms as discretizations of the Polyak equation. We show that the algorithms are instances of Additive Runge-Kutta integrators and discuss the reasons why most discretizations of the differential equation do not result in optimization algorithms with acceleration. We also introduce a modification of Polyak's equation and study its convergence properties. Finally we extend the general framework to the stochastic scenario and consider an application to random algorithms with acceleration for overparameterized models; again we are able to prove convergence rates that improve on those in the literature.</description>

      <title>Beyond Regular Grids: Fourier-Based Neural Operators on Arbitrary Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational efficiency of many neural operators, widely used for learning solutions of PDEs, relies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for performing spectral computations. As the FFT is limited to equispaced (rectangular) grids, this limits the efficiency of such neural operators when applied to problems where the input and output functions need to be processed on general non-equispaced point distributions. Leveraging the observation that a limited set of Fourier (Spectral) modes suffice to provide the required expressivity of a neural operator, we propose a simple method, based on the efficient direct evaluation of the underlying spectral transformation, to extend neural operators to arbitrary domains. An efficient implementation* of such direct spectral evaluations is coupled with existing neural operator models to allow the processing of data on arbitrary non-equispaced distributions of points. With extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows us to extend neural operators to arbitrary point distributions with significant gains in training speed over baselines while retaining or improving the accuracy of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) and related neural operators.</description>

      <title>A Vortex Damping Outflow Forcing for Multiphase Flows with Sharp Interfacial Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflow boundaries play an important role in multiphase fluid dynamics simulations that involve transition between liquid and vapor phases. These flows are dominated by low Weber numbers and a sharp jump in pressure, velocity, and temperature. Inadequate treatment of these jumps at the outlet generates undesirable fluid disturbances that propagate upstream and lead to instabilities within the computational domain. To mitigate these disturbances, we introduce a forcing term that can be applied to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to enforce stability in the numerical solution. The forcing term acts as a damping mechanism to control vortices that are generated by droplet/bubbles in multiphase flows, and is designed to be a general formulation that can be coupled with a fixed pressure outflow boundary condition to simulate a variety of multiphase flow problems. We demonstrate its applicability to simulate pool and flow boiling problems, where bubble-induced vortices during evaporation and condensation present a challenge at the outflow. Validation and verification cases are chosen to quantify accuracy and stability of the proposed method in comparison to established benchmarks and reference solutions, along with detailed performance analysis for three-dimensional simulations on leadership supercomputing platforms. Computational experiments are performed using Flash-X, which is a composable open-source software instrument designed for multiscale fluid dynamics simulations on heterogeneous architectures.</description>

      <title>New asymptotic expansion formula via Malliavin calculus and its application to rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Improved error estimates for the order of convergence of the Euler method for random ordinary differential equations driven by semi-martingale noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15418v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Euler method for approximating the solutions of a random ordinary differential equation (RODE) $\mathrm{d}X_t/\mathrm{d}t = f(t, X_t, Y_t)$ driven by a stochastic process $\{Y_t\}_t$ with $\theta$-H\"older sample paths is estimated to be of strong order $\theta$ with respect to the time step, provided $f=f(t, x, y)$ is sufficiently regular and with suitable bounds. This order was known to increase to $1$ in some special cases, such as that of an It\^o diffusion noise, in which case the Euler for RODE can be seen as a particular case of the Milstein method for an associated augmented system of stochastic differential equations. Here, it is proved that, in many more typical cases, further structures on the noise can be exploited so that the strong convergence is of order 1. More precisely, we prove so for any semi-martingale noise. This includes It\^o diffusion processes, point-process noises, transport-type processes with sample paths of bounded variation, and time-changed Brownian motion. This also yields a direct proof of order 1 convergence for It\^o process noises. The result follows from estimating the global error as an iterated integral over both large and small mesh scales, and then by switching the order of integration to move the critical regularity to the large scale. The work is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the strong order 1 convergence in those cases, and with an example with fractional Brownian motion noise with Hurst parameter $0 &lt; H &lt; 1/2$ for which the order of convergence is $H + 1/2$, hence lower than the attained order 1 in the semi-martingale examples above, but still higher than the order $H$ of convergence expected from previous works.</description>
