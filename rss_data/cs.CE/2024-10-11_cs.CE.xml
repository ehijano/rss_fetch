      <title>Parametric probabilistic approach for cumulative fatigue damage using double linear damage rule considering limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a parametric probabilistic approach to model damage accumulation using the double linear damage rule (DLDR) considering the existence of limited experimental fatigue data. A probabilistic version of DLDR is developed in which the joint distribution of the knee-point coordinates is obtained as a function of the joint distribution of the DLDR model input parameters. Considering information extracted from experiments containing a limited number of data points, an uncertainty quantification framework based on the Maximum Entropy Principle and Monte Carlo simulations is proposed to determine the distribution of fatigue life. The proposed approach is validated using fatigue life experiments available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Mapping Hong Kong's Financial Ecosystem: A Network Analysis of the SFC's Licensed Professionals and Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of the Public Register of Licensed Persons and Registered Institutions maintained by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) through the lens of complex network analysis. This dataset, spanning 21 years with daily granularity, provides a unique view of the evolving social network between licensed professionals and their affiliated firms in Hong Kong's financial sector. Leveraging large language models, we classify firms (e.g., asset managers, banks) and infer the likely nationality and gender of employees based on their names. This application enhances the dataset by adding rich demographic and organizational context, enabling more precise network analysis. Our preliminary findings reveal key structural features, offering new insights into the dynamics of Hong Kong's financial landscape. We release the structured dataset to enable further research, establishing a foundation for future studies that may inform recruitment strategies, policy-making, and risk management in the financial industry.</description>

      <title>Hexahedral mesh of anatomical atlas for construction of computational human brain models: Applications to modeling biomechanics and bioelectric field propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations rely on constructing accurate and detailed models to produce reliable results - a task that is often challenging. This task becomes notably more difficult when the model is of the human brain. We create an anatomically comprehensive hexahedral mesh of the human brain using an open-source digital brain atlas. Digital atlases are valuable tools currently used by medical professionals, medical students, and researchers for gathering, presenting, and discovering knowledge about the human brain. We demonstrate that the atlas can be used to efficiently create an accurate and detailed hexahedral finite element mesh of the brain for scientific computing. We present two case studies. The first case study constructs a biomechanical model of the brain to compute brain deformations and predict traumatic brain injury risk due to violent impact. In the second case study, we construct a bioelectrical model of the brain to solve the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem, a frequent simulation process used in electrophysiology to study electromagnetic fields generated by the nervous system. We demonstrate efficient and accurate model construction using the meshed anatomical brain atlas, as well as emphasize the importance of effective communication and contextual analysis of results for enabling multi-disciplinary scientific computing research.</description>
