      <title>Signatures of extreme events in the cumulative entropic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the cumulative effect of the empirical probability distribution of a random variable is identified as a factor that amplifies the occurrence of extreme events in datasets. To quantify this observation, a corresponding information measure is introduced, drawing upon Shannon entropy for joint probabilities. The proposed approach is validated using selected market data as case studies, encompassing various instances of extreme events. In particular, the results indicate that the introduced cumulative measure exhibits distinctive signatures of such events, even when the data is relatively noisy. These findings highlight the potential of the discussed concept for developing a new class of related indicators or classifiers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying deviations from Gaussianity with application to flight delays distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for quantifying deviations from Gaussianity by leveraging the permutation Jensen-Shannon distance. Using stable distributions as a flexible framework, we analyze the effects of skewness and heavy tails in synthetic sequences. We employ phase-randomized surrogates as Gaussian references to systematically evaluate the statistical distance between this reference and stable distributions. Our methodology is validated using real flight delay datasets from major airports in Europe and the United States, revealing significant deviations from Gaussianity, particularly at high-traffic airports. These results highlight systematic air traffic management strategies differences between the two geographic regions.</description>

      <title>Landscape computations for the edge of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic sampling approach to identify stability boundaries in general dynamical systems. The global landscape of Lyapunov exponent in multi-dimensional parameter space provides transition boundaries for stable/unstable trajectories, i.e., the edge of chaos. Despite its usefulness, it is generally difficult to derive analytically. In this study, we reveal the transition boundaries by leveraging the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm coupled directly with the numerical integration of nonlinear differential/difference equation. It is demonstrated that a posteriori modeling for parameter subspace along the edge of chaos determines an inherent constrained dynamical system to flexibly activate or de-activate the chaotic tra jectories.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Thermodynamic Properties of Classical Oscillators Under Statistical and Superstatistical Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the thermodynamic properties of classical oscillators under different statistical distributions, focusing on the behavior of uniform distribution, two-level distribution, gamma distribution, log-normal distribution, and F-distribution as the nonequilibrium parameter q varies. By calculating Helmholtz free energy and entropy, we reveal the unique patterns and characteristics exhibited by each distribution during the process of moving away from equilibrium. The results show that uniform and two-level distributions exhibit consistent trends of decreasing free energy and increasing entropy under nonequilibrium statistics, reflecting an increase in system disorder. In contrast, the gamma, log-normal, and F-distributions display complex dual-equilibrium point phenomena, where the system can briefly return to equilibrium at specific q values. However, as q further increases, the system rapidly moves away from equilibrium, exhibiting pronounced nonequilibrium characteristics. These findings not only deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium statistical physics but also provide new theoretical perspectives and methods for studying the nonequilibrium behavior of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Single-Ended Event Reconstruction in PROSPECT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Environmental Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small, forested catchments are prototypes of terrestrial ecosystems and have been studied in several disciplines of environmental sciences since several decades. Time series of water and matter fluxes and nutrient concentrations from these systems exhibit a bewildering diversity of spatio-temporal patterns, indicating the intricate nature of processes acting on a large range of time scales. Nonlinear dynamics is an obvious framework to investigate catchment time series. We analyze selected long-term data from three headwater catchments in the Bramke valley, Harz mountains, Lower Saxony in Germany at common biweekly resolution for the period 1991 to 2023. For every time series, we perform gap filling, detrending and removal of the annual cycle using Singular System Analysis (SSA), and then calculate metrics based on ordinal pattern statistics: the permutation entropy, permutation complexity and Fisher information, as well as their generalized versions (q-entropy and {\alpha}-entropy). Further, the position of each variable in Tarnopolski diagrams is displayed and compared to reference stochastic processes, like fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian noise, and \b{eta} noise. Still another way of distinguishing deterministic chaos and structured noise, and quantifying the latter, is provided by the complexity from ordinal pattern positioned slopes (COPPS). We also construct Horizontal Visibility Graphs and estimate the exponent of the decay of the degree distribution. Taken together, the analyses create a characterization of the dynamics of these systems which can be scrutinized for universality, either across variables or between the three geographically very close catchments.</description>
