      <title>CoordField: Coordination Field for Agentic UAV Task Allocation In Low-altitude Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.</description>

      <title>Optimized Lattice-Structured Flexible EIT Sensor for Tactile Reconstruction and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers a promising alternative to traditional tactile sensing approaches, enabling low-cost, scalable, and deformable sensor designs. Here, we propose an optimized lattice-structured flexible EIT tactile sensor incorporating a hydrogel-based conductive layer, systematically designed through three-dimensional coupling field simulations to optimize structural parameters for enhanced sensitivity and robustness. By tuning the lattice channel width and conductive layer thickness, we achieve significant improvements in tactile reconstruction quality and classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate high-quality tactile reconstruction with correlation coefficients up to 0.9275, peak signal-to-noise ratios reaching 29.0303 dB, and structural similarity indexes up to 0.9660, while maintaining low relative errors down to 0.3798. Furthermore, the optimized sensor accurately classifies 12 distinct tactile stimuli with an accuracy reaching 99.6%. These results highlight the potential of simulation-guided structural optimization for advancing flexible EIT-based tactile sensors toward practical applications in wearable systems, robotics, and human-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies for Underactuated Satellite Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomy is a key challenge for future space exploration endeavours. Deep Reinforcement Learning holds the promises for developing agents able to learn complex behaviours simply by interacting with their environment. This paper investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning for the satellite attitude control problem, namely the angular reorientation of a spacecraft with respect to an in- ertial frame of reference. In the proposed approach, a set of control policies are implemented as neural networks trained with a custom version of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to maneuver a small satellite from a random starting angle to a given pointing target. In particular, we address the problem for two working conditions: the nominal case, in which all the actuators (a set of 3 reac- tion wheels) are working properly, and the underactuated case, where an actuator failure is simulated randomly along with one of the axes. We show that the agents learn to effectively perform large-angle slew maneuvers with fast convergence and industry-standard pointing accuracy. Furthermore, we test the proposed method on representative hardware, showing that by taking adequate measures controllers trained in simulation can perform well in real systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing gaussian mixture of motion modes for skid-steer state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skid-steered wheel mobile robots (SSWMRs) are characterized by the unique domination of the tire-terrain skidding for the robot to move. The lack of reliable friction models cascade into unreliable motion models, especially the reduced ordered variants used for state estimation and robot control. Ensemble modeling is an emerging research direction where the overall motion model is broken down into a family of local models to distribute the performance and resource requirement and provide a fast real-time prediction. To this end, a gaussian mixture model based modeling identification of model clusters is adopted and implemented within an interactive multiple model (IMM) based state estimation. The framework is adopted and implemented for angular velocity as the estimated state for a mid scaled skid-steered wheel mobile robot platform.</description>

      <title>Investigating Adaptive Tuning of Assistive Exoskeletons Using Offline Reinforcement Learning: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assistive exoskeletons have shown great potential in enhancing mobility for individuals with motor impairments, yet their effectiveness relies on precise parameter tuning for personalized assistance. In this study, we investigate the potential of offline reinforcement learning for optimizing effort thresholds in upper-limb assistive exoskeletons, aiming to reduce reliance on manual calibration. Specifically, we frame the problem as a multi-agent system where separate agents optimize biceps and triceps effort thresholds, enabling a more adaptive and data-driven approach to exoskeleton control. Mixed Q-Functionals (MQF) is employed to efficiently handle continuous action spaces while leveraging pre-collected data, thereby mitigating the risks associated with real-time exploration. Experiments were conducted using the MyoPro 2 exoskeleton across two distinct tasks involving horizontal and vertical arm movements. Our results indicate that the proposed approach can dynamically adjust threshold values based on learned patterns, potentially improving user interaction and control, though performance evaluation remains challenging due to dataset limitations.</description>

      <title>PSN Game: Game-theoretic Planning via a Player Selection Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While game-theoretic planning frameworks are effective at modeling multi-agent interactions, they require solving optimization problems with hundreds or thousands of variables, resulting in long computation times that limit their use in large-scale, real-time systems. To address this issue, we propose PSN Game: a novel game-theoretic planning framework that reduces runtime by learning a Player Selection Network (PSN). A PSN outputs a player selection mask that distinguishes influential players from less relevant ones, enabling the ego player to solve a smaller, masked game involving only selected players. By reducing the number of variables in the optimization problem, PSN directly lowers computation time. The PSN Game framework is more flexible than existing player selection methods as it i) relies solely on observations of players' past trajectories, without requiring full state, control, or other game-specific information; and ii) requires no online parameter tuning. We train PSNs in an unsupervised manner using a differentiable dynamic game solver, with reference trajectories from full-player games guiding the learning. Experiments in both simulated scenarios and human trajectory datasets demonstrate that i) PSNs outperform baseline selection methods in trajectory smoothness and length, while maintaining comparable safety and achieving a 10x speedup in runtime; and ii) PSNs generalize effectively to real-world scenarios without fine-tuning. By selecting only the most relevant players for decision-making, PSNs offer a general mechanism for reducing planning complexity that can be seamlessly integrated into existing multi-agent planning frameworks.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Automatic Design of Efficient Underwater Gliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</description>

      <title>LightEMMA: Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, fully exploiting their capabilities for safe and reliable vehicle control remains an open research challenge. To systematically examine advances and limitations of VLMs in driving tasks, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration and evaluation of evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing metrics such as inference time, computational cost, and predictive accuracy. Illustrative examples highlight that, despite their strong scenario interpretation capabilities, VLMs' practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains concerning, emphasizing the need for further improvements. The code is available at https://github.com/michigan-traffic-lab/LightEMMA.</description>

      <title>J-PARSE: Jacobian-based Projection Algorithm for Resolving Singularities Effectively in Inverse Kinematic Control of Serial Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J-PARSE is a method for smooth first-order inverse kinematic control of a serial manipulator near kinematic singularities. The commanded end-effector velocity is interpreted component-wise, according to the available mobility in each dimension of the task space. First, a substitute "Safety" Jacobian matrix is created, keeping the aspect ratio of the manipulability ellipsoid above a threshold value. The desired motion is then projected onto non-singular and singular directions, and the latter projection scaled down by a factor informed by the threshold value. A right-inverse of the non-singular Safety Jacobian is applied to the modified command. In the absence of joint limits and collisions, this ensures smooth transition into and out of low-rank poses, guaranteeing asymptotic stability for target poses within the workspace, and stability for those outside. Velocity control with J-PARSE is benchmarked against the Least-Squares and Damped Least-Squares inversions of the Jacobian, and shows high accuracy in reaching and leaving singular target poses. By expanding the available workspace of manipulators, the method finds applications in servoing, teleoperation, and learning.</description>

      <title>FedEMA: Federated Exponential Moving Averaging with Negative Entropy Regularizer in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).</description>

      <title>AI2-Active Safety: AI-enabled Interaction-aware Active Safety Analysis with Vehicle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception in complex traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Active Contact Engagement for Aerial Navigation in Unknown Environments with Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world scenarios, where transparent glass obstacles present significant challenges to reliable navigation. Researchers have investigated the use of non-contact sensors and passive contact-resilient aerial vehicle designs to detect glass surfaces, which are often limited in terms of robustness and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for robust autonomous aerial navigation in unknown environments with transparent glass obstacles, combining the strengths of both sensor-based and contact-based glass detection. The proposed system begins with the incremental detection and information maintenance about potential glass surfaces using visual sensor measurements. The vehicle then actively engages in touch actions with the visually detected potential glass surfaces using a pair of lightweight contact-sensing modules to confirm or invalidate their presence. Following this, the volumetric map is efficiently updated with the glass surface information and safe trajectories are replanned on the fly to circumvent the glass obstacles. We validate the proposed system through real-world experiments in various scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and robust autonomous aerial navigation in complex real-world environments with glass obstacles.</description>

      <title>Multi-segment Soft Robot Control via Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots, compared to regular rigid robots, as their multiple segments with soft materials bring flexibility and compliance, have the advantages of safe interaction and dexterous operation in the environment. However, due to its characteristics of high dimensional, nonlinearity, time-varying nature, and infinite degree of freedom, it has been challenges in achieving precise and dynamic control such as trajectory tracking and position reaching. To address these challenges, we propose a framework of Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control (DK-MPC) for handling multi-segment soft robots. We first employ a deep learning approach with sampling data to approximate the Koopman operator, which therefore linearizes the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of the soft robots into a finite-dimensional linear representation. Secondly, this linearized model is utilized within a model predictive control framework to compute optimal control inputs that minimize the tracking error between the desired and actual state trajectories. The real-world experiments on the soft robot "Chordata" demonstrate that DK-MPC could achieve high-precision control, showing the potential of DK-MPC for future applications to soft robots.</description>

      <title>Holistic Optimization of Modular Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular robots have the potential to revolutionize automation as one can optimize their composition for any given task. However, finding optimal compositions is non-trivial. In addition, different compositions require different base positions and trajectories to fully use the potential of modular robots. We address this problem holistically for the first time by jointly optimizing the composition, base placement, and trajectory, to minimize the cycle time of a given task. Our approach is evaluated on over 300 industrial benchmarks requiring point-to-point movements. Overall, we reduce cycle time by up to 25% and find feasible solutions in twice as many benchmarks compared to optimizing the module composition alone. In the first real-world validation of modular robots optimized for point-to-point movement, we find that the optimized robot is successfully deployed in nine out of ten cases in less than an hour.</description>

      <title>iMacSR: Intermediate Multi-Access Supervision and Regularization in Training Autonomous Driving Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL)-based street scene semantic understanding has become a cornerstone of autonomous driving (AD). DL model performance heavily relies on network depth. Specifically, deeper DL architectures yield better segmentation performance. However, as models grow deeper, traditional one-point supervision at the final layer struggles to optimize intermediate feature representations, leading to subpar training outcomes. To address this, we propose an intermediate Multi-access Supervision and Regularization (iMacSR) strategy. The proposed iMacSR introduces two novel components: (I) mutual information between latent features and ground truth as intermediate supervision loss ensures robust feature alignment at multiple network depths; and (II) negative entropy regularization on hidden features discourages overconfident predictions and mitigates overfitting. These intermediate terms are combined into the original final-layer training loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. The proposed iMacSR provides a robust framework for training deep AD architectures, advancing the performance of perception systems in real-world driving scenarios. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed iMacSR. Extensive experiments on AD benchmarks (i.e., Cityscapes, CamVid, and SynthiaSF datasets) demonstrate that iMacSR outperforms conventional final-layer single-point supervision method up to 9.19% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Mode for PX4 on Embedded Flight Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes an open-sourced implementation of a neural-network based controller framework within the PX4 stack. We develop a custom module for inference on the microcontroller while retaining all of the functionality of the PX4 autopilot. Policies trained in the Aerial Gym Simulator are converted to the TensorFlow Lite format and then built together with PX4 and flashed to the flight controller. The policies substitute the control-cascade within PX4 to offer an end-to-end position-setpoint tracking controller directly providing normalized motor RPM setpoints. Experiments conducted in simulation and the real-world show similar tracking performance. We thus provide a flight-ready pipeline for testing neural control policies in the real world. The pipeline simplifies the deployment of neural networks on embedded flight controller hardware thereby accelerating research on learning-based control. Both the Aerial Gym Simulator and the PX4 module are open-sourced at https://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator and https://github.com/SindreMHegre/PX4-Autopilot-public/tree/for_paper.

      <title>Decentralised, Self-Organising Drone Swarms using Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of robotic synchronisation and coordination is a long-standing one. Combining autonomous, computerised systems with unpredictable real-world conditions can have consequences ranging from poor performance to collisions and damage. This paper proposes using coupled oscillators to create a drone swarm that is decentralised and self organising. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptiveness than a hard-coded swarm, with more resilience and scalability than a centralised system. Our method allows for a variable number of drones to spontaneously form a swarm and react to changing swarm conditions. Additionally, this method includes provisions to prevent communication interference between drones, and signal processing techniques to ensure a smooth and cohesive swarm.</description>

      <title>MULE: Multi-terrain and Unknown Load Adaptation for Effective Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes. Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or manual tuning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interactive Learning on the Job via Facility Location Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference, and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while maintaining successful task completion.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural-Representation Learning for Elastic Deformable-Object Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation (DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm.

      <title>Safety-Critical Traffic Simulation with Guided Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However, existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>DeCo: Task Decomposition and Skill Composition for Zero-Shot Generalization in Long-Horizon 3D Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing language-conditioned multi-task imitation learning (IL) models to novel long-horizon 3D manipulation tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose DeCo (Task Decomposition and Skill Composition), a model-agnostic framework compatible with various multi-task IL models, designed to enhance their zero-shot generalization to novel, compositional, long-horizon 3D manipulation tasks. DeCo first decomposes IL demonstrations into a set of modular atomic tasks based on the physical interaction between the gripper and objects, and constructs an atomic training dataset that enables models to learn a diverse set of reusable atomic skills during imitation learning. At inference time, DeCo leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to parse high-level instructions for novel long-horizon tasks, retrieve the relevant atomic skills, and dynamically schedule their execution; a spatially-aware skill-chaining module then ensures smooth, collision-free transitions between sequential skills. We evaluate DeCo in simulation using DeCoBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess zero-shot generalization of multi-task IL models in compositional long-horizon 3D manipulation. Across three representative multi-task IL models (RVT-2, 3DDA, and ARP), DeCo achieves success rate improvements of 66.67%, 21.53%, and 57.92%, respectively, on 12 novel compositional tasks. Moreover, in real-world experiments, a DeCo-enhanced model trained on only 6 atomic tasks successfully completes 9 novel long-horizon tasks, yielding an average success rate improvement of 53.33% over the base multi-task IL model.

      <title>TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

      <title>ParkDiffusion: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction for Automated Parking using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</description>

Abstract: Deterministic partially observable Markov decision processes (DetPOMDPs) often arise in planning problems where the agent is uncertain about its environmental state but can act and observe deterministically. In this paper, we propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI) algorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state controllers (FSCs). DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate, outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Verification for Gliding Drone Control: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems, verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability, which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's lives and reduce our impact on the environment.</description>

      <title>Forward kinematics of a general Stewart-Gough platform by elimination templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes an efficient algebraic solution to the problem of forward kinematics for a general Stewart-Gough platform. The problem involves determining all possible postures of a mobile platform connected to a fixed base by six legs, given the leg lengths and the internal geometries of the platform and base. The problem is known to have 40 solutions (whether real or complex). The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps: (i) a specific sparse matrix of size 293x362 (the elimination template) is constructed from the coefficients of the polynomial system describing the platform's kinematics; (ii) the PLU decomposition of this matrix is used to construct a pair of 69x69 matrices; (iii) all 40 solutions (including complex ones) are obtained by computing the generalized eigenvectors of this matrix pair. The proposed algorithm is numerically robust, computationally efficient, and straightforward to implement - requiring only standard linear algebra decompositions. MATLAB, Julia, and Python implementations of the algorithm will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>GeoDEx: A Unified Geometric Framework for Tactile Dexterous and Extrinsic Manipulation under Force Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sense of touch that allows robots to detect contact and measure interaction forces enables them to perform challenging tasks such as grasping fragile objects or using tools. Tactile sensors in theory can equip the robots with such capabilities. However, accuracy of the measured forces is not on a par with those of the force sensors due to the potential calibration challenges and noise. This has limited the values these sensors can offer in manipulation applications that require force control. In this paper, we introduce GeoDEx, a unified estimation, planning, and control framework using geometric primitives such as plane, cone and ellipsoid, which enables dexterous as well as extrinsic manipulation in the presence of uncertain force readings. Through various experimental results, we show that while relying on direct inaccurate and noisy force readings from tactile sensors results in unstable or failed manipulation, our method enables successful grasping and extrinsic manipulation of different objects. Additionally, compared to directly running optimization using SOCP (Second Order Cone Programming), planning and force estimation using our framework achieves a 14x speed-up.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety of training task policies and their subsequent application using reinforcement learning (RL) methods has become a focal point in the field of safe RL. A central challenge in this area remains the establishment of theoretical guarantees for safety during both the learning and deployment processes. Given the successful implementation of Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety strategies in a range of control-affine robotic systems, CBF-based safe RL demonstrates significant promise for practical applications in real-world scenarios. However, integrating these two approaches presents several challenges. First, embedding safety optimization within the RL training pipeline requires that the optimization outputs be differentiable with respect to the input parameters, a condition commonly referred to as differentiable optimization, which is non-trivial to solve. Second, the differentiable optimization framework confronts significant efficiency issues, especially when dealing with multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a CBF-based safe RL architecture that effectively mitigates the issues outlined above. The proposed approach constructs a continuous AND logic approximation for the multiple constraints using a single composite CBF. By leveraging this approximation, a close-form solution of the quadratic programming is derived for the policy network in RL, thereby circumventing the need for differentiable optimization within the end-to-end safe RL pipeline. This strategy significantly reduces computational complexity because of the closed-form solution while maintaining safety guarantees. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to existing approaches relying on differentiable optimization, the proposed method significantly reduces training computational costs while ensuring provable safety throughout the training process.</description>

      <title>Robotic Visual Instruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Guidance and Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles via HEOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new approach to the guidance and control of marine craft via HEOL, i.e., a new way of combining flatness-based and model-free controllers. Its goal is to develop a general regulator for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV). To do so, the well-known USV maneuvering model is simplified into a nominal Hovercraft model which is flat. A flatness-based controller is derived for the simplified USV model and the loop is closed via an intelligent proportional-derivative (iPD) regulator. We thus associate the well-documented natural robustness of flatness-based control and adaptivity of iPDs. The controller is applied in simulation to two surface vessels, one meeting the simplifying hypotheses, the other one being a generic USV of the literature. It is shown to stabilize both systems even in the presence of unmodeled environmental disturbances.</description>

      <title>Urban Air Mobility as a System of Systems: An LLM-Enhanced Holonic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution. Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.</description>

      <title>Variational OOD State Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.</description>

      <title>InterLoc: LiDAR-based Intersection Localization using Road Segmentation with Automated Evaluation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network. They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a 5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Roles in Robotic Teams with Model Sharing and Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach, this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment without the need for explicit communication between agents.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules: Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity, realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility. URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents: Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each robot's strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Sim-Anchored Learning for On-the-Fly Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning simulation-trained RL agents with real-world data often degrades crucial behaviors due to limited or skewed data distributions. We argue that designer priorities exist not just in reward functions, but also in simulation design choices like task selection and state initialization. When adapting to real-world data, agents can experience catastrophic forgetting in important but underrepresented scenarios. We propose framing live-adaptation as a multi-objective optimization problem, where policy objectives must be satisfied both in simulation and reality. Our approach leverages critics from simulation as "anchors for design intent" (anchor critics). By jointly optimizing policies against both anchor critics and critics trained on real-world experience, our method enables adaptation while preserving prioritized behaviors from simulation. Evaluations demonstrate robust behavior retention in sim-to-sim benchmarks and a sim-to-real scenario with a racing quadrotor, allowing for power consumption reductions of up to 50% without control loss. We also contribute SwaNNFlight, an open-source firmware for enabling live adaptation on similar robotic platforms.</description>

Abstract: Achieving human-level speed and performance on real world tasks is a north star for the robotics research community. This work takes a step towards that goal and presents the first learned robot agent that reaches amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. Table tennis is a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. In this paper, we contribute (1) a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of (i) low level controllers with their detailed skill descriptors which model the agent's capabilities and help to bridge the sim-to-real gap and (ii) a high level controller that chooses the low level skills, (2) techniques for enabling zero-shot sim-to-real including an iterative approach to defining the task distribution that is grounded in the real-world and defines an automatic curriculum, and (3) real time adaptation to unseen opponents. Policy performance was assessed through 29 robot vs. human matches of which the robot won 45% (13/29). All humans were unseen players and their skill level varied from beginner to tournament level. Whilst the robot lost all matches vs. the most advanced players it won 100% matches vs. beginners and 55% matches vs. intermediate players, demonstrating solidly amateur human-level performance.

      <title>Towards Global Localization using Multi-Modal Object-Instance Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Re-identification (ReID) is a critical challenge in computer vision, predominantly studied in the context of pedestrians and vehicles. However, robust object-instance ReID, which has significant implications for tasks such as autonomous exploration, long-term perception, and scene understanding, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel dual-path object-instance re-identification transformer architecture that integrates multimodal RGB and depth information. By leveraging depth data, we demonstrate improvements in ReID across scenes that are cluttered or have varying illumination conditions. Additionally, we develop a ReID-based localization framework that enables accurate camera localization and pose identification across different viewpoints. We validate our methods using two custom-built RGB-D datasets, as well as multiple sequences from the open-source TUM RGB-D datasets. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both object instance ReID (mAP of 75.18) and localization accuracy (success rate of 83% on TUM-RGBD), highlighting the essential role of object ReID in advancing robotic perception. Our models, frameworks, and datasets have been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>ProxFly: Robust Control for Close Proximity Quadcopter Flight via Residual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the ProxFly, a residual deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller for close proximity quadcopter flight. Specifically, we design a residual module on top of a cascaded controller (denoted as basic controller) to generate high-level control commands, which compensate for external disturbances and thrust loss caused by downwash effects from other quadcopters. First, our method takes only the ego state and controllers' commands as inputs and does not rely on any communication between quadcopters, thereby reducing the bandwidth requirement. Through domain randomization, our method relaxes the requirement for accurate system identification and fine-tuned controller parameters, allowing it to adapt to changing system models. Meanwhile, our method not only reduces the proportion of unexplainable signals from the black box in control commands but also enables the RL training to skip the time-consuming exploration from scratch via guidance from the basic controller. We validate the effectiveness of the residual module in the simulation with different proximities. Moreover, we conduct the real close proximity flight test to compare ProxFly with the basic controller and an advanced model-based controller with complex aerodynamic compensation. Finally, we show that ProxFly can be used for challenging quadcopter mid-air docking, where two quadcopters fly in extreme proximity, and strong airflow significantly disrupts flight. However, our method can stabilize the quadcopter in this case and accomplish docking. The resources are available at https://github.com/ruiqizhang99/ProxFly.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces MotionGlot, a model that can generate motion across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions, such as quadruped robots and human bodies. By leveraging the well-established training procedures commonly used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce an instruction-tuning template specifically designed for motionrelated tasks. Our approach demonstrates that the principles underlying LLM training can be successfully adapted to learn a wide range of motion generation tasks across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions. We demonstrate the various abilities of MotionGlot on a set of 6 tasks and report an average improvement of 35.3% across tasks. Additionally, we contribute two new datasets: (1) a dataset of expert-controlled quadruped locomotion with approximately 48,000 trajectories paired with direction-based text annotations, and (2) a dataset of over 23,000 situational text prompts for human motion generation tasks. Finally, we conduct hardware experiments to validate the capabilities of our system in real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Achieving robust legged locomotion on complex terrains poses challenges due to the high uncertainty in robot-environment interactions. Recent advances in bipedal and quadrupedal robots demonstrate good mobility on rugged terrains but rely heavily on sensors for stability due to low static stability from a high center of mass and a narrow base of support. We hypothesize that a multi-legged robotic system can leverage morphological redundancy from additional legs to minimize sensing requirements when traversing challenging terrains. Studies suggest that a multi-legged system with sufficient legs can reliably navigate noisy landscapes without sensing and control, albeit at a low speed of up to 0.1 body lengths per cycle (BLC). However, the control framework to enhance speed on challenging terrains remains underexplored due to the complex environmental interactions, making it difficult to identify the key parameters to control in these high-degree-of-freedom systems. Here, we present a bio-inspired vertical body undulation wave as a novel approach to mitigate environmental disturbances affecting robot speed, supported by experiments and probabilistic models. Finally, we introduce a control framework which monitors foot-ground contact patterns on rugose landscapes using binary foot-ground contact sensors to estimate terrain rugosity. The controller adjusts the vertical body wave based on the deviation of the limb's averaged actual-to-ideal foot-ground contact ratio, achieving a significant enhancement of up to 0.235 BLC on rugose laboratory terrain. We observed a $\sim$ 50\% increase in speed and a $\sim$ 40\% reduction in speed variance compared to the open-loop controller. Additionally, the controller operates in complex terrains outside the lab, including pine straw, robot-sized rocks, mud, and leaves.</description>

      <title>GLOVER: Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning for Task-Oriented Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring affordable (i.e., graspable) parts of arbitrary objects based on human specifications is essential for robots advancing toward open-vocabulary manipulation. Current grasp planners, however, are hindered by limited vision-language comprehension and time-consuming 3D radiance modeling, restricting real-time, open-vocabulary interactions with objects. To address these limitations, we propose GLOVER, a unified Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning framework, which fine-tunes the Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the visual affordance of graspable object parts within RGB feature space. We compile a dataset of over 10,000 images from human-object interactions, annotated with unified visual and linguistic affordance labels, to enable multi-modal fine-tuning. GLOVER inherits world knowledge and common-sense reasoning from LLMs, facilitating more fine-grained object understanding and sophisticated tool-use reasoning. To enable effective real-world deployment, we present Affordance-Aware Grasping Estimation (AGE), a non-parametric grasp planner that aligns the gripper pose with a superquadric surface derived from affordance data. In evaluations across 30 table-top real-world scenes, GLOVER achieves success rates of 86.0% in part identification and 76.3% in grasping, with speeds approximately 29 times faster in affordance reasoning and 40 times faster in grasping pose estimation than the previous state-of-the-art. We also validate the generalization across embodiments, showing effectiveness in humanoid robots with dexterous hands.</description>

      <title>Generating Traffic Scenarios via In-Context Learning to Learn Better Motion Planner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

      <title>Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE.</description>

Abstract: Localization is a critical aspect of mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate their environment efficiently and avoid obstacles. Current probabilistic localization methods, such as the Adaptive-Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm, are computationally intensive and may struggle with large maps or high-resolution sensor data. This paper explores the application of quantum computing in robotics, focusing on the use of Grover's search algorithm to improve the efficiency of localization in mobile robots. We propose a novel approach to utilize Grover's algorithm in a 2D map, enabling faster and more efficient localization. Despite the limitations of current physical quantum computers, our experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup over classical methods, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to improve robotic localization. This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and robotics, providing a practical solution for robotic localization and paving the way for future research in quantum robotics.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Safety Beyond Collision-Avoidance via Latent-Space Reachability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a rigorous mathematical framework that enables robots to simultaneously detect unsafe states and generate actions that prevent future failures. While in theory, HJ reachability can synthesize safe controllers for nonlinear systems and nonconvex constraints, in practice, it has been limited to hand-engineered collision-avoidance constraints modeled via low-dimensional state-space representations and first-principles dynamics. In this work, our goal is to generalize safe robot controllers to prevent failures that are hard--if not impossible--to write down by hand, but can be intuitively identified from high-dimensional observations: for example, spilling the contents of a bag. We propose Latent Safety Filters, a latent-space generalization of HJ reachability that tractably operates directly on raw observation data (e.g., RGB images) to automatically compute safety-preserving actions without explicit recovery demonstrations by performing safety analysis in the latent embedding space of a generative world model. Our method leverages diverse robot observation-action data of varying quality (including successes, random exploration, and unsafe demonstrations) to learn a world model. Constraint specification is then transformed into a classification problem in the latent space of the learned world model. In simulation and hardware experiments, we compute an approximation of Latent Safety Filters to safeguard arbitrary policies (from imitation- learned policies to direct teleoperation) from complex safety hazards, like preventing a Franka Research 3 manipulator from spilling the contents of a bag or toppling cluttered objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence seamlessly integrates vision, language, and action.~However, most multimodal robotic models rely on massive fine-tuning, incurring high time and hardware costs.~To address this, we introduce RoboBERT, an end-to-end multimodal manipulation model built around a novel two-stage training paradigm.~In the first stage, we freeze most of the vision encoder and train with a single "standard" instruction phrasing, allowing the model to focus on stable policy learning via a CNN-based diffusion policy.~In the second stage, we unfreeze all modules and inject diverse natural language variants, rapidly aligning varied instructions to the already-learned policy without destabilizing performance.~We further employ systematic data augmentations to enhance robustness against visual perturbations.~Without relying on auxiliary datasets, RoboBERT achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean episode lengths of 4.52 on the CALVIN ABCD-D benchmark and 3.79 on the ABC-D benchmark using only language-labeled expert demonstrations and a comparatively lightweight architecture.Real-robot trials on a 6-DOF manipulator confirm higher success rates than comparable methods trained on identical data.These results demonstrate that our data-augmentation-enhanced two-stage training paradigm delivers efficient, scalable, and broadly applicable performance for multimodal robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But existing methods come with two key limitations: they require expert demonstrations, which can be difficult to obtain, and they are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be warm-started at inference time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling high-frequency feedback. We believe that generative predictive control offers a complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static demonstration-oriented tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for safe navigation in dynamic environments by integrating Koopman operator theory with conformal prediction. Our approach leverages data-driven Koopman approximation to learn nonlinear dynamics and employs conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, providing statistical guarantees on approximation errors. This uncertainty is effectively incorporated into a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) formulation through constraint tightening, ensuring robust safety guarantees. We implement a layered control architecture with a reference generator providing waypoints for safe navigation. The effectiveness of our methods is validated in simulation.</description>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful model-free paradigm for learning optimal policies. However, in navigation tasks with cluttered environments, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, especially under sparse rewards or complex dynamics with system disturbances. To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense reward function grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state space. This graph provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal strategies. We validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating substantial improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates.</description>

      <title>Follow Everything: A Leader-Following and Obstacle Avoidance Framework with Goal-Aware Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust and flexible leader-following is a critical capability for robots to integrate into human society. While existing methods struggle to generalize to leaders of arbitrary form and often fail when the leader temporarily leaves the robot's field of view, this work introduces a unified framework addressing both challenges. First, traditional detection models are replaced with a segmentation model, allowing the leader to be anything. To enhance recognition robustness, a distance frame buffer is implemented that stores leader embeddings at multiple distances, accounting for the unique characteristics of leader-following tasks. Second, a goal-aware adaptation mechanism is designed to govern robot planning states based on the leader's visibility and motion, complemented by a graph-based planner that generates candidate trajectories for each state, ensuring efficient following with obstacle avoidance. Simulations and real-world experiments with a legged robot follower and various leaders (human, ground robot, UAV, legged robot, stop sign) in both indoor and outdoor environments show competitive improvements in follow success rate, reduced visual loss duration, lower collision rate, and decreased leader-follower distance.</description>

      <title>PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>Learning An Active Inference Model of Driver Perception and Control: Application to Vehicle Car-Following</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.</description>

      <title>RobMOT: Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking by Observational Noise and State Estimation Drift Mitigation on LiDAR PointCloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses limitations in 3D tracking-by-detection methods, particularly in identifying legitimate trajectories and reducing state estimation drift in Kalman filters. Existing methods often use threshold-based filtering for detection scores, which can fail for distant and occluded objects, leading to false positives. To tackle this, we propose a novel track validity mechanism and multi-stage observational gating process, significantly reducing ghost tracks and enhancing tracking performance. Our method achieves a $29.47\%$ improvement in Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI validation dataset with the Second detector. Additionally, a refined Kalman filter term reduces localization noise, improving higher-order tracking accuracy (HOTA) by $4.8\%$. The online framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple detectors, with HOTA improvements of up to $3.92\%$ on the KITTI testing dataset and $8.7\%$ on the validation dataset, while achieving low identity switch scores. RobMOT excels in challenging scenarios, tracking distant objects and prolonged occlusions, with a $1.77\%$ MOTA improvement on the Waymo Open dataset, and operates at a remarkable 3221 FPS on a single CPU, proving its efficiency for real-time multi-object tracking.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks in Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the controller synthesis problem for general MIMO systems with unknown dynamics, aiming to fulfill the temporal reach-avoid-stay task, where the unsafe regions are time-dependent, and the target must be reached within a specified time frame. The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</description>

      <title>PPT: Pretraining with Pseudo-Labeled Trajectories for Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting how agents move in dynamic scenes is essential for safe autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>GSFeatLoc: Visual Localization Using Feature Correspondence on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for localizing a query image with respect to a precomputed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</description>
