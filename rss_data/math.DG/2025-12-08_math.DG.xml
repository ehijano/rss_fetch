      <title>Weakly Einstein conformal products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One says that a Riemannian four-manifold is \emph{weakly Einstein} if the three-index contraction of its curvature tensor against itself equals a function times the metric. Since this includes all four-manifolds that are Einstein, or conformally flat and scalar-flat, the term \emph{proper} may be used for weakly Einstein manifolds (or metrics) not belonging to the latter two classes. We establish two classification-type results about proper weakly Einstein metrics conformal to Riemannian products. This includes constructions of new examples, among them -- some of (local) cohomogeneity two, in contrast with the two previously known narrow classes of examples, having cohomogeneity zero and one. We also exhibit a simple coordinate description of one of the known examples, the EPS space, which shows that it is a conformal product and constitutes a single local-homothety type. Finally, we prove that there exist no proper weakly Einstein manifolds with harmonic curvature.</description>

      <title>From the discrete to the continuous, from simplicial complexes to Riemannian manifolds. Approximating flows and cuts on manifolds by discrete versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fundamental structures of Riemannian geometry have found discrete counterparts for graphs or combinatorial ones for simplicial complexes. These include those discussed in this survey, Hodge theory, Morse theory, the spectral theory of Laplace type operators and Cheeger inequalities, and their interconnections. This raises the question of the relation between them, abstractly as structural analogies and concretely what happens when a graph constructed from random sampling of a Riemannian manifold or a simplicial complex triangulating such a manifold converge to that manifold. We survey the current state of research, highlighting some recent developments like Cheeger type inequalities for the higher dimensional geometry of simplicial complexes, Floer type constructions in the presence of periodic or homoclinic orbits of dynamical systems or the disorientability of simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Sharp gradient estimates and monotonicity in positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp gradient estimate for the natural Green's function of a closed manifold with positive Ricci curvature. We also show that this estimate is closely related to a family of monotonicity formulae. These results extend those previously obtained by Colding and Minicozzi for open manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We further obtain several geometric applications, including a new proof of Bishop's volume comparison theorem in dimension four.</description>

      <title>Normal sub-Riemannian geodesics related to filtrations of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a natural way to construct sub-Riemannian structures that depend on $n$ parameters on compact Lie groups. These structures are related to the filtrations of Lie subalgebras $\mathfrak g_0 &lt; \mathfrak g_1 &lt; \mathfrak g_2 &lt; \dots &lt; \mathfrak g_{n-1}&lt;\mathfrak g_n=\mathfrak g=Lie(G)$. In the case where $n=1$, the explicit solution for normal sub-Riemannian geodesics was provided by Agrachev, Brockett, and Jurjdevic. We extend their solution to apply to general chains of Lie subgroups. Additionally, we describe normal geodesic lines of the induced sub-Riemannian structures on homogeneous spaces $G/K$, where $\mathfrak g_0=Lie(K)$.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of geodesically convex functions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove that all geodesically convex functions defined on a Riemannian manifold are continuous in the interior of their domain. This is a folklore result, but to the best of our knowledge, there is only one available proof, which is largely cited. However, it contains a significant gap, which we fill here. We also discuss extensions of this result beyond the Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>Curvature estimates for steady and expanding solitons in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate certain curvature estimates on complete non-compact steady and expanding gradient Ricci solitons in higher dimensions. In the expanding case, we prove that if the Ricci curvature decays at least quadratically, then the curvature operator decays at the rate $\BigO(1/r^{2})$ when $n=4$ and $\BigO((\log r)/r^{2})$ when $n\geq5$. This refines the curvature bounds in a previous result by Cao-Liu-Xie, and removes the nonnegative Ricci curvature assumption in the estimates by Cao-Liu and Cao-Liu-Xie. As a geometric application, we establish the existence and uniqueness of $C^{1,\alpha}$ conical structure at infinity of Ricci expander with finite Ricci curvature ratio. In the steady case, using an integral estimate of the curvature, we prove that the curvature operator has at most polynomial growth when the potential function is proper and the Ricci curvature has linear decay. Moreover, we also confirm that the curvature is bounded if we further assume the Ricci curvature has super-linear decay $\BigO(r^{-1-\varepsilon})$. As an application, we prove the existence and uniqueness of cylindrical structure at infinity of steady soliton with super-linear Ricci curvature decay and proper potential function.</description>

      <title>Scalar-mean rigidity beyond warped product spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main scalar-mean extremality and rigidity results in the existing literature concern manifolds whose curvature operators are nonnegative, or warped product spaces with a log-concave warping function whose leaves carry metrics of nonnegative curvature operator. In this paper, we establish scalar-mean extremality and rigidity theorems for a broad class of Riemannian manifolds with boundary whose metrics are conformal to ones with nonnegative curvature operator. In particular, our results extend these theorems beyond the warped product setting and yields new families of manifolds exhibiting scalar-mean extremality and rigidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Reilly formula for differential forms on weighted manifolds with nonempty boundary. As an application of this formula, we prove a Poincar\'e-type inequality in the same context and explore several of its consequences. We also present weighted versions of some boundary value problems and obtain new eigenvalue estimates that extend previously known results.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations of metric spaces and Lorentzian pre-length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce conformal transformations in the synthetic setting of metric spaces and Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces. Our main focus lies on the Lorentzian case, where, motivated by the need to extend classical notions to spaces of low regularity, we provide the first consistent notion of conformal length, and analyse its fundamental properties. We prove that the conformal time separation function $\tau_{\Omega}$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $\tau_{\Omega}$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes. Moreover, we apply the same methods to the metric case, which is of interest in its own right. This is exemplified by proving an analog of the Nomizu--Ozeki theorem for metric length spaces, which has the advantage that the resulting complete space is conformally related to the original space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present explicit computations of non-trivial triple $ABC$-Massey products on non-K\"ahler solvmanifolds endowed with an invariant complex structure. We prove that the {\em Bigalke-Rollenske manifold}, the {\em generalized Nakamura manifolds} satisfying some suitable assumptions and compact quotients of the solvable Lie group $\mathbb{C}^{2n}\ltimes_{\rho} \mathbb{C}^{2m}$ have non-vanishing triple $ABC$-Massey products. Furthermore, such manifolds have no astheno-K\"ahler metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the geometry of Gerstner's water wave model, we analyse the velocity of his fluid particles in a reference frame that moves with the wave. Gerstner wave profiles are cycloidal, curtate (flattened) trochoids, or prolate (extended) trochoids. We derive both the height of each profile's characterising point (cusp, inflection, or self-intersection), as well as a condition under which the arc lengths of prolate and curtate profiles coincide over a single wave cycle. We conclude with a discussion of how Galilean transformations affect particle acceleration and the geometry of their trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an optimal upper bound for local volumes of Gorenstein canonical non-hypersurface threefold singularities. Specifically, we show that a klt threefold singularity with local volume at least $9$ is either a hypersurface singularity or a quotient singularity. As applications, we obtain new restrictions on the singularities of members in K-moduli spaces of Fano threefolds, and we establish a sharp inequality between local volumes and minimal log discrepancies for threefold singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey focuses on strong closing lemmas in Hamiltonian dynamics that are proved using spectral invariants (also known as action selectors) in symplectic geometry. We review strong closing lemmas in low-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics (Reeb flows on contact three-manifolds and area-preserving maps on symplectic surfaces) and outline the key ideas behind their proofs. We also discuss results concerning strong closing lemmas in high-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as analogous results for minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symplectic geometry, Floer theory is the most important tool to prove the existence of time-periodic solutions in Hamiltonian mechanics. The core observation is that the $L^2$-gradient lines of the symplectic action functional are pseudo-holomorphic curves, enabling the use of elliptic PDE methods. Multisymplectic geometry is the geometric framework underlying Hamiltonian field theory, where the time line is replaced by higher-dimensional manifolds. In the case of two dimensions and using complex structures, we introduce a novel multisymplectic framework that is fit for the generalization of the elliptic methods from symplectic geometry. Besides proving a Darboux theorem, we show that the $L^2$-gradient lines of our multisymplectic action functional are now pseudo-Fueter curves defined using a compatible almost hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Categorifying isomonodromic deformations via Lie groupoids I: Logarithmic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the classical operation of \textit{isomonodromic deformations} along a path $\gamma$ to a functor $\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}$ between categories of flat connections with logarithmic singularities along a divisor $D$, which itself depends functorially on $\gamma$, using tools from the theory of Lie groupoids. As applications, (1) we get that isomonodromy gives a map of moduli \textit{stacks} of flat connections with logarithmic singularities, (2) we encode higher homotopical information at level 2, i.e. we get an action of the fundamental 2-groupoid of the base of our family on the categories of logarithmic flat connections on the fibres, and (3) our methods produce a geometric incarnation of the isomonodromy functors as Morita equivalences which are more primary than the isomonodromy functors themselves, and from which they can be formally extracted by passing to representation categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Benoist, we study objects linked to integrable tangent vectors on the character variety of a semi-group $\Gamma$ with values in a semi-simple real-algebraic group $\mathsf G$. We prove the \emph{cone of Jordan variations} has non-empty interior and, when $\mathsf G$ is split, establish non-empty interior of the set of \emph{length-normalized variations}. We apply these techniques to pressure forms on Anosov representations and higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. We identify an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at Fuchsian points in the Hitchin component. Finally, we show the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of \emph{higher}-quasi-circles is governed by a Diophantine equation.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>The Conjugate Function Method for Surfaces with Elaborate Topological Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains on surfaces. In this paper the conjugate function method, earlier used for simply connected domains, is generalized and refined to achieve the same level of accuracy on multiply connected planar domains and Riemann surfaces. The main challenge is the accurate and efficient construction of boundary values for the conjugate problem on multiply connected domains. The method relies on high-order finite element methods which allow for highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry containing strong singularities and cusps. We also derive the reciprocal error estimate for the multiply connected case. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments with error estimates.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Geometry of Gravity, Strings and Fields: A Panoramic Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are expanded lecture notes of a mini-course whose objectives were to introduce the basic concepts, constructions and techniques of noncommutative geometry, as well as their uses as a framework for modelling quantum spacetime. Key mathematical approaches presented include operator algebras such as $C^*$-algebras, K-theory, spectral geometry, quantum groups, and deformation quantization. Physical application areas considered include string theory, quantum field theory, and the Standard Model, as well as certain condensed matter systems.</description>
