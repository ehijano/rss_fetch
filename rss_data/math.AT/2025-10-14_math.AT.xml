      <title>Motivic Homotopy Groups of Spheres and Free Summands of Stably Free Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10033v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, we show that the motivic stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum can be determined entirely from the motivic homotopy groups of the $p$-completed sphere spectra and the motivic cohomology of the ground field, except possibly for the $0$ and $-1$-stems. Using this, we show that the complex realization map from the motivic homotopy group to the classical stable homotopy group is an isomorphism in a range of bidegrees. We apply this to deduce that complex realization also induces isomorphisms on unstable homotopy groups for Stiefel varieties $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ in a range of bidegrees. This allows a complete solution of the question of when the projection map $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ admits a right inverse. Equivalently, this settles the question of when the universal stably-free module of type $(n,n-1)$ admits a free summand of given rank.</description>

      <title>A Schauder Basis for Multiparameter Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain classes of multiparameter persistence modules may be encoded as signed barcodes, represented as points in a polyhedral subset of Euclidean space, we refer to as signed persistence diagrams. These signed persistence diagrams exist in the dual space of compactly supported, Lipschitz functionals on a polyhedral pair. In the interest of statistics and machine learning on multiparameter persistence modules, we aim to embed these signed persistence diagrams into Banach or Hilbert space. We use iteratively refined triangulations to define a Schauder Basis of compactly supported Lipschitz functionals. Evaluation of these functionals embeds signed persistence diagrams into the space of real-valued sequences. Furthermore, we show that in the larger space of relative Radon measures, the Schauder basis we have defined is minimal to induce an embedding.</description>

Abstract: We present a comparison map between the uberhomology of a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ and the double homology of its associated moment-angle complex $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}}$. We show these two homology theories differ at three bidegrees, which depend on whether the complex $K$ is neighbourly or not.</description>

      <title>Oriented Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop foundations for oriented category theory, an extension of $(\infty,\infty)$-category theory obtained by systematic usage of the Gray tensor product, in order to study lax phenomena in higher category theory. As categorical dimension increases, classical category-theoretic concepts generally prove too rigid or fully break down and must be replaced by oriented versions, which allow more flexible notions of naturality and coherence. Oriented category theory provides a framework to address these issues. The main objects of study are oriented, and their conjugate antioriented, categories, which are deformations of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories where the various compositions only commute up to a coherent (anti)oriented interchange law. We give a geometric description of (anti)oriented categories as sheaves on a deformation of the simplex category $\Delta$ in which the linear graphs are weighted by (anti)oriented cubes.
  To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show that the categorical analogues of fundamental constructions in homotopy theory, such as cylinder and path objects, join and slice, and suspension and loops, are not functors of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories, but only of (anti)oriented categories, generalizing work of Ara, Guetta, and Maltsiniotis in the strict setting. As a main result we construct an embedding of the theory of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories into the theory of (anti)oriented categories and characterize the image, which we call (anti)oriented spaces.
  We provide an algebraic description of (anti)oriented spaces as (anti)oriented categories satisfying a strict (anti)oriented interchange law and a geometric description as sheaves on suitable categories of (anti)oriented polytopes, generalizing Grothendieck's philosophy of test categories to higher categorical dimension and refining Campion's work on lax cubes and suitable sites.</description>

      <title>The Freed--Quinn line bundle from higher geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, and level $\alpha\in Z^3(BG;{\rm U}(1))$, Freed and Quinn construct a line bundle over the moduli space of $G$-bundles on surfaces. Global sections determine the values of Chern--Simons theory at level $\alpha$ on surfaces. In this paper, we provide an alternate construction using tools from higher geometry: the pair $(G,\alpha)$ determines a 2-group group, and the Freed--Quinn line arises as a categorical truncation of the bicategory of 2-group bundles.</description>

      <title>The Rational Homotopy of Stable $C_p$-Smoothings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth structures on high dimensional manifolds are classified by maps to the infinite loop space $TOP/O$. The homotopy groups of this space are known to be finite. Given a compact Lie group $G$, this space can be regarded as an equivariant infinite loop space and equivariant maps from a locally linear, high dimensional $G$-manifold to $TOP/O$ classify stable $G$-smoothings. We compute the equivariant homotopy groups $\pi_V^{C_p}TOP/O\otimes\Q$ where $C_p$ denotes the cyclic group of order $p$.</description>

      <title>Extensions between functors from Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first Ext-groups between Schur functors in the category of modules over the $\Bbbk$-linearization $\Bbbk\mathbf{gr}^{\operatorname{op}}$ of the opposite of the category of finitely generated free groups are computed for a filed $\Bbbk$ of characteristic $0$. The $\Bbbk$-linear category $\mathbf{A}$ of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies, which was introduced by Habiro and Massuyeau, has an $\mathbb{N}$-grading whose degree $0$ part identifies with the category $\Bbbk\mathbf{gr}^{\operatorname{op}}$. We compute the first Ext-groups in the category of $\mathbf{A}$-modules between simple $\mathbf{A}$-modules which are induced by Schur functors.</description>

      <title>On the Coarse Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse analog of the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category which we denote by $\text{c-cat}$, defined for metric spaces in the coarse homotopy category. This provides a new tool for studying large-scale topological properties of groups and spaces. We establish that $\text{c-cat}$ is a coarse homotopy invariant and prove a lower-bound $\text{p-cat}(\Gamma)\leq \text{c-cat}(\Gamma)$ for geometrically finite groups $\Gamma$, where $\text{p-cat}$ denotes the proper LS-category introduced in 1992 by Ayala and co-authors. We also prove an upper bound $\text{c-cat}(\Gamma) \leq \text{asdim}(\Gamma)$ for bicombable 1-ended groups which are semistable at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>$F$-divided bundles on normal $F$-finite schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study $F$-divided bundles on irreducible Noetherian normal $F$-finite $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes and we show that their Tannakian category is governed by the behaviour at the generic point. In particular, if $U\subset X$ is an open subset of a normal variety defined over an algebraically closed field then the corresponding homomorphism of $F$-divided fundamental groups is faithfully flat. This is analogous to a known fact about the topological fundamental group of an open subset of a normal complex analytic variety. We use this result to show that simply connected, proper, normal varieties in positive characteristic admit no nontrivial $F$-divided bundles. This generalizes an earlier result of H. Esnault and V. Mehta concerning smooth projective varieties, and settles Gieseker's conjecture in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On the integral simplicial volume of cyclic covers of mapping tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the integral simplicial volume of cyclic covers of manifolds that fiber over the circle with fiber given by an $n$-dimensional torus. By studying the integral filling volume -- an invariant introduced by Frigerio and the first author -- for the monodromy, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the limit of the integral simplicial volume of these covers, normalized by the degree of the covering. These bounds are expressed in terms of the action of the monodromy on the real homology of the fiber.
  As applications, we establish a close connection between the topological entropy and the integral filling volume of self-homeomorphisms of $n$-dimensional tori, we find new examples for which the Delta-complexity and the integral simplicial volume are not equivalent, and we prove the nonvanishing of the filling volume for Anosov self-diffeomorphisms of infranilmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Fine shape of metrizable spaces as a left fraction localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong shape category of compact metrizable spaces (compacta) is very well-studied; extending it to noncompact spaces, however, introduces computational complexity that makes it hard to work with. The fine shape category, as defined by Melikhov, seems to hold promise in terms of both applicability and simplicity: it is a different extension of compact strong shape to a generalized homotopy theory of metrizable spaces that is compatible with both \v{C}ech cohomology and Steenrod-Sitnikov homology, and its definition lends itself to straightforward proofs. Further research seems to be in order. One goal to have in mind is to show the fine shape category to be a homotopy category in Quillen's sense, which implies representation as a localization. But the strong shape of compacta was shown to be a left fraction localization in several ways; we extend the representation given by Cathey to fine shape, introducing the notion of FDR-embeddings to extend Cathey's SSDR-maps. In the process, we also introduce what we call the mapping cylinder of an approaching map; such a construction has been defined by Ferry and elaborated on by Mrozik in the compact case, yet it seems the direct extension on noncompact spaces is not possible. Thus we resort to a somewhat different definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs have seen widespread application in network and data science communities in recent years. We present a survey of recent work to construct auxiliary structures from hypergraphs -- specifically simplicial, relative, and chain complexes -- that can be used to build homology theories for hypergraphs. We define and describe nine different constructions and their associated homology theories. We discuss some interesting properties of each homology theory to show how various hypergraph properties imply properties of the homology groups. We also include discussion of functoriality for several of the homology theories. Finally, we provide a series of illustrative examples by computing many of these homology theories for small hypergraphs to show the variability of the methods and build intuition.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By using the Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>

Abstract: Let $f\in\pi_{n+k}(S^{n})$, ($n\geq2$ and $k\geq0$) and let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of the pinch map $\Sigma C_{f}=S^{n+1}\cup e^{n+k+2} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$; (further suppose that $\Sigma C_{f}\not\simeq*$ if $k=0$). Assume that, via the homoptopy fibration $F\rightarrow \Sigma C_{f} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$, we wish to compute the $p$-primary component of $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ which is possibly far unstable, where the prime $p\neq3$. As a type of Gray's relative James constructions, $ F$ has a CW decomposition $F=(S^{n+1}\cup_{\alpha} e^{2n+k+2})\cup_{\beta} e^{3n+2k+3}\cup \cdots$, where $\alpha=[1_{S^{n+1}},\Sigma f]$ is the Whitehead product and $\beta$ is a higher Whitehead product. However, higher Whitehead products are intricate to manage. In this paper, by use of Selick-Wu's $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{min}}$-theory and the machinery of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, we show that in the 2-local case, the attaching map $\beta$ is decomposed to be $\Sigma ^{2n+k+2}f$ composing with a certain inclusion; in the $p$-local case, where $p\geq5$ and $n+k$ is odd, $\beta$ admits a similar decomposition. In other words, the attaching map $\Sigma f$ manifests a ``periodicity'' phenomenon. Therefore, we are able to calculate $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})\otimes \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ in the range requiring the 3-cell skeleton of $F$. As an application, we determine the 2-primary component of $\pi_{18}(\Sigma ^{3}\mathbb{C}P^{2})$.</description>

      <title>Computing Flat-Injective Presentations of Multigraded Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{flat-injective presentation} of a persistence module $M$ characterizes $M$ as the image of a morphism from a flat to an injective persistence module. Like flat or injective presentations, flat-injective presentations can be easily represented by a single \emph{monomial matrix}, completely describe the persistence module, and can be used as starting point to compute other invariants of it, such as the rank invariant, persistence images, and others.
  If $M$ has finite total dimension, then it has a finite free resolution $F_\bullet$ and a finite injective resolution $I^\bullet$, and a flat-injective presentation of $M$ is given by the morphism $\phi\colon F_0 \to I^0$. We present an algorithm to compute a monomial matrix representing $\phi$ from the matrices representing $F_\bullet$ (or $I^\bullet$), using a simple correspondence between free and injective resolutions of $M$. The algorithm, of which an implementation is available at \cite{FlangePresentations.jl}, has cubic run time in the total rank of $F_\bullet$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop versions of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt and Cartier-Milnor-Moore theorems in the setting of braided Hopf algebras. To do so, we introduce new analogues of a Lie algebra in the setting of a braided monoidal category, using the notion of a braided operad.</description>

      <title>On the straightening of every functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any functor between $\infty$-categories can be straightened. More precisely, we show that for any $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, there is an equivalence between the $\infty$-category $(\mathrm{Cat}_{\infty})_{/\mathcal{C}}$ of $\infty$-categories over $\mathcal{C}$ and the $\infty$-category of unital lax functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to the double $\infty$-category $\mathrm{Corr}$ of correspondences. The proof relies on a certain universal property of the Morita category which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Induction in perverse schobers and cluster tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit gluing properties of cluster tilting subcategories in exact $\infty$-categories within the framework of perverse schobers on surfaces with boundary. These results are based on a study of the restriction functors from global sections of perverse schobers to local sections and their adjoint induction functors. New examples include cluster tilting subcategories in higher rank topological Fukaya categories related to higher Teichm\"uller theory, and cluster tilting subcategories arising from marked surfaces with punctures.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</description>
