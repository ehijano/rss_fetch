      <title>Construction of a Neural Network with Temperature-Dependent Recall Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple model that recalls two different patterns depending on the temperature. To realize a change in recall pattern due to temperature change, we embed two patterns to different graphs: the first pattern into a fully connected graph and the second pattern into a sparse graph. Because a fully connected graph is more resistant to thermal fluctuations than a sparse graph, we can realize a change in recall pattern by tuning relative weights of the two patterns properly. We demonstrate by equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations that such a temperature-dependent change in recall patterns does occur in our model. Simulation results strongly indicate that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition when the change in recall patterns occurs. It is also demonstrated by annealing simulations that the system fails to recall the pattern embedded in the sparse graph at low temperatures if the free-energy barrier is too high to overcome within the given simulation timescale.</description>

      <title>Spectral Decimation of Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theory of spectral decimation for quantum many-body Hamiltonians and show that it provides a quantitative probe of emergent symmetries in statistically mixed spectra. Building on an analytical description of statistical mixtures, we derive an explicit expression for the size of a characteristic symmetry sector (CSS), defined as the largest subsequence of levels exhibiting non-Poissonian correlations. The CSS dimension is shown to be the size-biased average of the underlying symmetry sectors, establishing a direct link between spectral statistics and Hilbert-space structure. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic settings: Hilbert-space fragmentation and disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL). In fragmented systems, the CSS reproduces the mixture prediction and isolates correlated subsectors even when the full spectrum appears nearly Poissonian. In the disordered Heisenberg chain, spectral decimation reveals the gradual emergence of integrability through a shrinking CSS, whose statistics exhibit signatures consistent with local integrals of motion. We introduce a characteristic symmetry entropy (CSE) as a finite-size scaling observable and extract, within accessible system sizes, the crossover exponents. Our results establish spectral decimation as a controlled, unbiased and computationally inexpensive diagnostic of hidden structure in many-body spectra, capable of distinguishing between chaotic dynamics, statistical mixtures, and emergent integrability.</description>

      <title>The Jammed Phase of Infinitely Persistent Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extreme active matter system, which is essentially a dense assembly of athermal, soft and infinitely persistent active particles. Using extensive numerical simulations we obtain jammed configurations of this system in two dimensions and probe the stability of such structures under increasing active forcing magnitude. We show that the critical active forcing magnitude for the jammed phase to yield scales with virial pressure as $f_c\sim p^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1.17$, describing the yielding line. Using a Laplacian framework, we redistribute the active forces into a modified contact force network. By analysing the statistics of these redistributed forces, we obtain a very robust scaling law consistent with the passive limit, not just near the unjamming line, but in the entire jammed active phase. The probability distribution of the magnitude of the contact force deviates from the power-law form found in passive systems for values smaller than the active force. Moreover, within the jammed phase, the system displays elastic, plastic, and yielding events with increasing active forcing. This active plasticity appears abruptly and can not be captured by the continuous softening of the Hessian spectrum. However, we demonstrate that the Hessian still retains the ability to predict relaxation times. These results clarify how activity modifies force distributions and leads to deformation, plasticity and yielding in dense, jammed, infinitely persistent active matter.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of strong disorder can significantly impact electrical conduction in metallic systems. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, $\rho(T)$, in nonmagnetic single crystals of the Remeika-phase cage compounds R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu). Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $\rho(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K. However, a model incorporating parallel conduction through both semiconducting and metallic channels provides an adequate explanation. In addition to a dominant metallic conduction below $\sim 10$~K, a negative temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity ($d\rho/dT$) is found in both samples. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the observed $d\rho/dT &lt; 0$ is interpreted in terms of the structural Kondo mechanism.</description>

      <title>Isotropic 3D topological phases with broken time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axial vectors, such as current or magnetization, are commonly used order parameters in time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. These vectors also break isotropy in three dimensional systems, lowering the spatial symmetry. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct a three-dimensional medium with average isotropy and inversion symmetry where time-reversal symmetry is systematically broken. We devise a model of an amorphous material with scalar time-reversal symmetry breaking, implemented by hopping through chiral magnetic clusters along the bonds. The presence of only average spatial symmetries -- continuous rotation and inversion -- is sufficient to protect a topological phase, yielding a statistical topological insulator. We demonstrate the topological nature of our model by constructing a bulk integer topological invariant for the effective continuum model, which guarantees gapless surface spectrum on any surface with an odd number of Dirac nodes, analogous to crystalline mirror Chern insulators. We also show the expected transport properties of a three-dimensional statistical topological insulator, which remains critical on the surface for odd values of the invariant.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Infinite Width Feature Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks under gradient flow that quantifies when pretraining on a source task improves generalization on a target task. We analyze both (i) fine-tuning, when the downstream predictor is trained on top of source-induced features and (ii) a jointly rich setting, where both pretraining and downstream tasks can operate in a feature learning regime, but the downstream model is initialized with the features obtained after pre-training. In this setup, the summary statistics of randomly initialized networks after a rich pre-training are adaptive kernels which depend on both source data and labels. For (i), we analyze the performance of a readout for different pretraining data regimes. For (ii), the summary statistics after learning the target task are still adaptive kernels with features from both source and target tasks. We test our theory on linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory allows interpretable conclusions on performance, which depend on the amount of data on both tasks, the alignment between tasks, and the feature learning strength.</description>
