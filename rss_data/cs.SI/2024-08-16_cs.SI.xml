      <title>Polarization dynamics: a study of individuals shifting between political communities on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals engaging on social media often tend to establish online communities where interactions predominantly occur among like-minded peers. While considerable efforts have been devoted to studying and delineating these communities, there has been limited attention directed towards individuals who diverge from these patterns. In this study, we examine the community structure of re-post networks within the context of a polarized political environment at two different times. We specifically identify individuals who consistently switch between opposing communities and analyze the key features that distinguish them. Our investigation focuses on two crucial aspects of these users: the topological properties of their interactions and the political bias in the content of their posts. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising 2 million tweets related to US President Donald Trump, coupled with data from over 100 000 individual user accounts spanning the 2020 US presidential election year. Our findings indicate that individuals who switch communities exhibit disparities compared to those who remain within the same communities, both in terms of the topological aspects of their interaction patterns (pagerank, degree, betweenness centrality.) and in the sentiment bias of their content towards Donald Trump.</description>

      <title>Network analysis reveals news press landscape and asymmetric user polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike traditional media, online news platforms allow users to consume content that suits their tastes and to facilitate interactions with other people. However, as more personalized consumption of information and interaction with like-minded users increase, ideological bias can inadvertently increase and contribute to the formation of echo chambers, reinforcing the polarization of opinions. Although the structural characteristics of polarization among different ideological groups in online spaces have been extensively studied, research into how these groups emotionally interact with each other has not been as thoroughly explored. From this perspective, we investigate both structural and affective polarization between news media user groups on Naver News, South Korea's largest online news portal, during the period of 2022 Korean presidential election. By utilizing the dataset comprising 333,014 articles and over 36 million user comments, we uncover two distinct groups of users characterized by opposing political leanings and reveal significant bias and polarization among them. Additionally, we reveal the existence of echo chambers within co-commenting networks and investigate the asymmetric affective interaction patterns between the two polarized groups. Classification task of news media articles based on the distinct comment response patterns support the notion that different political groups may employ distinct communication strategies. Our approach based on network analysis on large-scale comment dataset offers novel insights into characteristics of user polarization in the online news platforms and the nuanced interaction nature between user groups.</description>

      <title>Disagreement as a way to study misinformation and its effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation - false or misleading information - is considered a significant societal concern due to its associated "misinformation effects," such as political polarization, erosion of trust in institutions, problematic behavior, and public health challenges. However, the prevailing concept is misaligned with what is studied. While misinformation focuses on instances of information about factual matters, the broad spectrum of effects often manifests at a societal level and is shaped by a wide range of interdependent factors such as identity, values, opinions, epistemologies, and disagreements. Unsurprisingly, misinformation effects can occur without the prevalence of misinformation, and misinformation does not necessarily increase the effects studied. Here, we propose using disagreement - conflicting attitudes and beliefs between individuals and communities - as a way to study misinformation effects because it addresses the identified conceptual limitations of misinformation. Furthermore, unlike misinformation, disagreement does not require researchers to determine whether a given information is false or misleading. Thus, it can be studied and, more importantly, measured without the need to make a normative judgment about a given information, even when the specific topic is entirely removed, as we show in a longitudinal disagreement measurement. We demonstrate that disagreement, as a holistic concept, provides better explanations for the occurrence of misinformation effects, enhances precision in developing appropriate interventions, and offers a promising approach for evaluating them through quantification. Finally, we show how disagreement addresses current misinformation research questions and conclude with recommendations for research practice.</description>

      <title>Cortical network reconfiguration aligns with shifts of basal ganglia and cerebellar influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role.</description>

      <title>RED-CT: A Systems Design Methodology for Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers for Computational Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced our ability to rapidly analyze and classify unstructured natural language data. However, concerns regarding cost, network limitations, and security constraints have posed challenges for their integration into work processes. In this study, we adopt a systems design approach to employing LLMs as imperfect data annotators for downstream supervised learning tasks, introducing novel system intervention measures aimed at improving classification performance. Our methodology outperforms LLM-generated labels in seven of eight tests, demonstrating an effective strategy for incorporating LLMs into the design and deployment of specialized, supervised learning models present in many industry use cases.</description>

      <title>Real-World Networks are Low-Dimensional: Theoretical and Practical Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the dimensionality of graphs is a central topic in machine learning. While the problem has been tackled empirically as well as theoretically, existing methods have several drawbacks. On the one hand, empirical tools are computationally heavy and lack theoretical foundation. On the other hand, theoretical approaches do not apply to graphs with heterogeneous degree distributions, which is often the case for complex real-world networks.
  To address these drawbacks, we consider geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) as a random graph model, which captures a variety of properties observed in practice. Our first result shows that the clustering coefficient of GIRGs scales inverse exponentially with respect to the number of dimensions, when the latter is at most logarithmic in $n$. This gives a first theoretical explanation for the low dimensionality of real-world networks as observed by Almagro et al. in 2022. We further use these insights to derive a linear-time algorithm for determining the dimensionality of a given GIRG and prove that our algorithm returns the correct number of dimensions with high probability GIRG. Our algorithm bridges the gap between theory and practice, as it not only comes with a rigorous proof of correctness but also yields results comparable to that of prior empirical approaches, as indicated by our experiments on real-world instances.</description>

      <title>Are Fact-Checking Tools Helpful? An Exploration of the Usability of Google Fact Check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fact-checking-specific search engines such as Google Fact Check are a promising way to combat misinformation on social media, especially during significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. presidential elections, but the usability of such an approach has not been thoroughly studied. We evaluated the performance of Google Fact Check by analyzing the retrieved fact-checking results regarding 1,000 COVID-19-related false claims and found it able to retrieve the fact-checking results for 15.8% of the input claims, and the results are relatively reliable. We also found that the false claims receiving different fact-checking verdicts (i.e., "False," "Partly False," "True," and "Unratable") tend to reflect diverse emotional tones, and fact-checking sources tend to check the claims in different lengths and using dictionary words to various extents. Claim variations addressing the same issue yet described differently are likely to retrieve distinct fact-checking results. We suggested that the quantities of the retrieved fact-checking results could be optimized and that slightly adjusting input wording may be the best practice for users to retrieve more useful information. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of state-of-the-art fact-checking tools and information integrity.</description>

      <title>Decentralized and Uncoordinated Learning of Stable Matchings: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings with unknown preferences in a decentralized and uncoordinated manner, where "decentralized" means that players make decisions individually without the influence of a central platform, and "uncoordinated" means that players do not need to synchronize their decisions using pre-specified rules. First, we provide a game formulation for this problem with known preferences, where the set of pure Nash equilibria (NE) coincides with the set of stable matchings, and mixed NE can be rounded to a stable matching. Then, we show that for hierarchical markets, applying the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm to the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated fashion. Moreover, we show that EXP converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general markets. We also introduce another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability. Finally, we provide stronger feedback conditions under which it is possible to drive the market faster toward an approximate stable matching. Our proposed game-theoretic framework bridges the discrete problem of learning stable matchings with the problem of learning NE in continuous-action games.</description>
