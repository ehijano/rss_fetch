      <title>Price of Locality in Permutation Mastermind: Are TikTok influencers Chaotic Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the permutation Mastermind game, the goal is to uncover a secret permutation $\sigma^\star \colon [n] \to [n]$ by making a series of guesses $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_T$ which must also be permutations of $[n]$, and receiving as feedback after guess $\pi_t$ the number of positions $i$ for which $\sigma^\star(i) = \pi_t(i)$. While the existing literature on permutation Mastermind suggests strategies in which $\pi_t$ and $\pi_{t+1}$ might be widely different permutations, a resurgence in popularity of this game as a TikTok trend shows that humans (or at least TikTok influencers) use strategies in which consecutive guesses are very similar. For example, it is common to see players attempt one transposition at a time and slowly see their score increase. Motivated by these observations, we study the theoretical impact of two forms of "locality" in permutation Mastermind strategies: $\ell_k$-local strategies, in which any two consecutive guesses differ in at most $k$ positions, and the even more restrictive class of $w_k$-local strategies, in which consecutive guesses differ in a window of length at most $k$. We show that, in broad terms, the optimal number of guesses for local strategies is quadratic, and thus much worse than the $O(n \lg n)$ guesses that suffice for non-local strategies. We also show NP-hardness of the satisfiability version for $\ell_3$-local strategies, whereas in the $\ell_2$-local variant the problem admits a randomized polynomial algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Almost Empty Monochromatic Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of counting almost empty monochromatic triangles in colored planar point sets, that is, triangles whose vertices are all assigned the same color and that contain only a few interior points. Specifically, we show that any $c$-coloring of a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position (that is, no three on a line) contains $\Omega(n^2)$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-1$ interior points and $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-2$ interior points, for any fixed $c \geq 2$. The latter, in particular, generalizes the result of Pach and T\'{o}th (2013) on the number of monochromatic empty triangles in 2-colored point sets, to the setting of multiple colors and monochromatic triangles with a few interior points. We also derive the limiting value of the expected number of triangles with $s$ interior points in random point sets, for any integer $s \geq 0$. As a result, we obtain the expected number of monochromatic triangles with at most $s$ interior points in random colorings of random point sets.</description>

      <title>The arc chromatic number for Galois projective planes, affine planes and Euclidean grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that the minimum number of arcs required to partition the Galois projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$ is $q+1$. Furthermore, we determine the exact value for a fractional variant of this problem.
  We extend our analysis to affine planes $\text{AG}(2,q)$, proving that they can be partitioned into $q$ arcs. In particular, we show that this partition is tight when $q$ is an odd prime power, and that a $(q-1)$-partition is attainable for $q=2^k$ with $k \in \{1,2,3\}$. For $q=2^k$ with $k \geq 4$, we provide bounds between two possible values.
  Finally, we apply these results to Euclidean grids, demonstrating that a partition into $(1+\epsilon)n$ sets in general position exists for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $n$. We also present exact minimal partitions for small Euclidean grids.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets I: an Elementary Bound for Directed Cycle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [Combinatorica 1996] proved Younger's Conjecture, which states that, for all directed graphs $D$, there exists a function $f$ such that, if $D$ does not contain $k$ disjoint cycles, then $D$ contains a feedback vertex set, i.e.~a subset of vertices whose deletion renders the graph acyclic, of size bounded by $f(k)$. However, the function obtained by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in their paper is enormous and, in fact, not even elementary. We prove the first elementary upper bound for the function $f$ above, showing it is upper-bounded by a power tower of height 8.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016], who proved a polynomial bound for the Excluded Grid Theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing \emph{paths of well-linked sets (PWS)}, and show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large PWS, which in turn contains a large fence.
  We believe that the theoretical tools developed in this work may find applications beyond the results above, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016] did for undirected graphs (see, for example, Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge [Discret.~Math.~Theor.~Comput.~Sci.~2022], Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA 2015] and Chuzhoy and Nimavat [arXiv 2019]). Indeed, in a follow-up paper, we apply this framework to improve the bounds of the Directed Grid Theorem.</description>

      <title>Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain subgraphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from aggregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description>
