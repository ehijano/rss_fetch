      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Completion of partial structures using Patterson maps with the CrysFormer machine learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Interspecific information use facilitates species coexistence in ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining how competing species coexist remains a central question in ecology. The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion. A model of predation dynamics that incorporates interspecific information use naturally explains coexistence beyond the limits imposed by CEP. Our model quantitatively reproduces two classical experiments that contradicts the CEP and captures coexistence patterns documented in natural ecosystems, offering a general mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.</description>

      <title>Fractional neural attention for efficient multiscale sequence processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\'evy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Cooperative Biomolecular Machines: Fluctuation Relations and Hidden Detailed Balance Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of soft microscopic objects.
  Here we apply this technique to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). To interpret vesicle deformation in RT-DC, we present a simulation-based model taking into account the area expansion modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area.
  Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the area expansion modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Murray's Law as an Entropy-per-Information-Cost Extremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any vascular or transport network must pay two energetic bills: power to drive flow and the cost of building and maintaining reliably decodable structure. This work formulates that tradeoff as an entropy-per-information-cost (EPIC) variational principle, which prices structural upkeep in absolute energetic units (J/bit). In the Poiseuille regime, equal-marginal-price stationarity yields the invariant $Q_i^2/(c_i r_i^{m+4}) = \mathrm{const}$ and hence $Q \propto r^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=(m+4)/2$ and a tariff-weighted Murray relation $\sqrt{c_0}\,r_0^{\alpha} = \sqrt{c_1}\,r_1^{\alpha} + \sqrt{c_2}\,r_2^{\alpha}$. Homogeneous tariffs recover the classical cubic law for volume-priced upkeep and its surface-priced analogue; generalized dissipation with exponent $n$ simply shifts $\alpha$ to $(m+n)/2$. Translational neutrality fixes branch directions via the tariff-weighted vector closure $\sum_i c_i r_i^m \mathbf e_i = 0$. Pricing dissipation at an audited bit energy $\varepsilon_b = \zeta k_B T \ln 2$ converts entropy production into an information throughput $\Psi_b = \sigma_s T / \varepsilon_b$ and yields a two-faced "growth-cone" bound on the rate of creating reliably decodable structure, limited by the smaller of the interior budget $P_{\mathrm{flow}}/\varepsilon_b$ and the boundary communication budget. On High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) images ($N = 19{,}127$ junctions), the held-out vector-closure residual $R(m)$ is tightly peaked around $0.21$, lies well to the left of four structure-preserving nulls, and is stable under radius jitter and quality-control ablations. These unit-consistent statements supply concrete, falsifiable targets for auditing energetic tariffs, testing weighted versus unweighted Murray scaling, and engineering "EPIC optics" in heterogeneous price fields.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Using apolar active suspensions of squirmers as model systems, we show how their long-time diffusive dynamics can surprisingly slow down and vary nonmonotonically with the shear rate arising from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced reorientation and diffusion. Further simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence exhibit richer dynamics and confirm the observed coupling, suggesting that nonmonotonic diffusion may be a general feature of fluids endowed with an underlying microstructure and large persistence. Our results reveal a nonlinear effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>
