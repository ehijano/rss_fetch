      <title>Analytical Solution of a Three-layer Network with a Matrix Exponential Activation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, deeper networks tend to be more powerful than shallow ones, but this has not been understood theoretically. In this paper, we find the analytical solution of a three-layer network with a matrix exponential activation function, i.e., $$ f(X)=W_3\exp(W_2\exp(W_1X)), X\in \mathbb{C}^{d\times d} $$ have analytical solutions for the equations $$
  Y_1=f(X_1),Y_2=f(X_2) $$ for $X_1,X_2,Y_1,Y_2$ with only invertible assumptions. Our proof shows the power of depth and the use of a non-linear activation function, since one layer network can only solve one equation,i.e.,$Y=WX$.</description>

      <title>Research on Autonomous Robots Navigation based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning continuously optimizes decision-making based on real-time feedback reward signals through continuous interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities. In recent years, it has become one of the key methods to achieve autonomous navigation of robots. In this work, an autonomous robot navigation method based on reinforcement learning is introduced. We use the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models to optimize the path planning and decision-making process through the continuous interaction between the robot and the environment, and the reward signals with real-time feedback. By combining the Q-value function with the deep neural network, deep Q network can handle high-dimensional state space, so as to realize path planning in complex environments. Proximal policy optimization is a strategy gradient-based method, which enables robots to explore and utilize environmental information more efficiently by optimizing policy functions. These methods not only improve the robot's navigation ability in the unknown environment, but also enhance its adaptive and self-learning capabilities. Through multiple training and simulation experiments, we have verified the effectiveness and robustness of these models in various complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uniform Transformation: Refining Latent Representation in Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irregular distribution in latent space causes posterior collapse, misalignment between posterior and prior, and ill-sampling problem in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptable three-stage Uniform Transformation (UT) module -- Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (G-KDE) clustering, non-parametric Gaussian Mixture (GM) Modeling, and Probability Integral Transform (PIT) -- to address irregular latent distributions. By reconfiguring irregular distributions into a uniform distribution in the latent space, our approach significantly enhances the disentanglement and interpretability of latent representations, overcoming the limitation of traditional VAE models in capturing complex data structures. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed UT module in improving disentanglement metrics across benchmark datasets -- dSprites and MNIST. Our findings suggest a promising direction for advancing representation learning techniques, with implication for future research in extending this framework to more sophisticated datasets and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Distributed Optimization: A Primal-Dual Perspective on Local Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed machine learning, efficient training across multiple agents with different data distributions poses significant challenges. Even with a centralized coordinator, current algorithms that achieve optimal communication complexity typically require either large minibatches or compromise on gradient complexity. In this work, we tackle both centralized and decentralized settings across strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We first demonstrate that a basic primal-dual method, (Accelerated) Gradient Ascent Multiple Stochastic Gradient Descent (GA-MSGD), applied to the Lagrangian of distributed optimization inherently incorporates local updates, because the inner loops of running Stochastic Gradient Descent on the primal variable require no inter-agent communication. Notably, for strongly convex objectives, we show (Accelerated) GA-MSGD achieves linear convergence in communication rounds despite the Lagrangian being only linear in the dual variables. This is due to a unique structural property where the dual variable is confined to the span of the coupling matrix, rendering the dual problem strongly concave. When integrated with the Catalyst framework, our approach achieves nearly optimal communication complexity across various settings without the need for minibatches. Moreover, in stochastic decentralized problems, it attains communication complexities comparable to those in deterministic settings, improving over existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>LLM-Select: Feature Selection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a surprising capability of large language models (LLMs): given only input feature names and a description of a prediction task, they are capable of selecting the most predictive features, with performance rivaling the standard tools of data science. Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., "blood pressure") in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., "heart failure"), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place. This could potentially benefit practitioners in domains like healthcare, where collecting high-quality data comes at a high cost.</description>

      <title>Output Range Analysis for Deep Neural Networks based on Simulated Annealing Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of output range estimation for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), introducing a novel algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA). Our approach addresses the lack of local geometric information and high non-linearity in DNNs, making it versatile across various architectures, especially Residual Neural Networks (ResNets). We present a straightforward, implementation-friendly algorithm that avoids restrictive assumptions about network architecture. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, including tests on the Ackley function, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in navigating complex, non-convex surfaces and accurately estimating DNN output ranges. Futhermore, the Python codes of this experimental evaluation that support our results are available in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Nicerova7/output-range-analysis-for-deep-neural-networks-with-simulated-annealing).</description>

      <title>Implementation and Analysis of GPU Algorithms for Vecchia Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly. Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large spatial-temporal dataset of $n&gt;10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendation in advertising, designed to foster research in algorithmic fairness within real-world scenarios. It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and business confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.</description>

      <title>Warm-up Free Policy Optimization: Improved Regret in Linear Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy Optimization (PO) methods are among the most popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in practice. Recently, Sherman et al. [2023a] proposed a PO-based algorithm with rate-optimal regret guarantees under the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. However, their algorithm relies on a costly pure exploration warm-up phase that is hard to implement in practice. This paper eliminates this undesired warm-up phase, replacing it with a simple and efficient contraction mechanism. Our PO algorithm achieves rate-optimal regret with improved dependence on the other parameters of the problem (horizon and function approximation dimension) in two fundamental settings: adversarial losses with full-information feedback and stochastic losses with bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>Stable Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation across Out-of-Distribution Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is vital for understanding the change of treatment effect across individuals or subgroups. Most existing HTE estimation methods focus on addressing selection bias induced by imbalanced distributions of confounders between treated and control units, but ignore distribution shifts across populations. Thereby, their applicability has been limited to the in-distribution (ID) population, which shares a similar distribution with the training dataset. In real-world applications, where population distributions are subject to continuous changes, there is an urgent need for stable HTE estimation across out-of-distribution (OOD) populations, which, however, remains an open problem. As pioneers in resolving this problem, we propose a novel Stable Balanced Representation Learning with Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm (SBRL-HAP) framework, which consists of 1) Balancing Regularizer for eliminating selection bias, 2) Independence Regularizer for addressing the distribution shift issue, 3) Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm for coordination between balance and independence. In this way, SBRL-HAP regresses counterfactual outcomes using ID data, while ensuring the resulting HTE estimation can be successfully generalized to out-of-distribution scenarios, thereby enhancing the model's applicability in real-world settings. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SBRL-HAP in achieving stable HTE estimation across OOD populations, with an average 10% reduction in the error metric PEHE and 11% decrease in the ATE bias, compared to the SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inference for Partially Observed Markov Processes using Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) has driven recent advances in machine learning, including deep neural networks and Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Partially observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems have proved resistant to AD techniques because widely used particle filter algorithms yield an estimated likelihood function that is discontinuous as a function of the model parameters. We show how to embed two existing AD particle filter methods in a theoretical framework that provides an extension to a new class of algorithms. This new class permits a bias/variance tradeoff and hence a mean squared error substantially lower than the existing algorithms. We develop likelihood maximization algorithms suited to the Monte Carlo properties of the AD gradient estimate. Our algorithms require only a differentiable simulator for the latent dynamic system; by contrast, most previous approaches to AD likelihood maximization for particle filters require access to the system's transition probabilities. Numerical results indicate that a hybrid algorithm that uses AD to refine a coarse solution from an iterated filtering algorithm show substantial improvement on current state-of-the-art methods for a challenging scientific benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Cross-sectoral Intersecting Discrepancies within Multiple Groups Using Latent Class Analysis Towards Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including EVENS and Census 2021 (England \&amp; Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between minority ethnic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in real-world AI applications. Additionally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to provide insights into the fairness of machine learning.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general observation model for restless multi-armed bandit problems. The operation of the player needs to be based on certain feedback mechanism that is error-prone due to resource constraints or environmental or intrinsic noises. By establishing a general probabilistic model for dynamics of feedback/observation, we formulate the problem as a restless bandit with a countable belief state space starting from an arbitrary initial belief (a priori information). We apply the achievable region method with partial conservation law (PCL) to the infinite-state problem and analyze its indexability and priority index (Whittle index). Finally, we propose an approximation process to transform the problem into which the AG algorithm of Ni\~no-Mora and Bertsimas for finite-state problems can be applied to. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has an excellent performance.</description>

      <title>VITS : Variational Inference Thompson Sampling for contextual bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a variant of the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for contextual bandits. At each round, traditional TS requires samples from the current posterior distribution, which is usually intractable. To circumvent this issue, approximate inference techniques can be used and provide samples with distribution close to the posteriors. However, current approximate techniques yield to either poor estimation (Laplace approximation) or can be computationally expensive (MCMC methods, Ensemble sampling...). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Varational Inference Thompson sampling VITS, based on Gaussian Variational Inference. This scheme provides powerful posterior approximations which are easy to sample from, and is computationally efficient, making it an ideal choice for TS. In addition, we show that VITS achieves a sub-linear regret bound of the same order in the dimension and number of round as traditional TS for linear contextual bandit. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of VITS on both synthetic and real world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being the most classical generative model for serial data, state-space models (SSM) are fundamental in AI and statistical machine learning. In SSM, any form of parameter learning or latent state inference typically involves the computation of complex latent-state posteriors. In this work, we build upon the variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) method, which provides computationally efficient and accurate model parameter estimation and Bayesian latent-state inference by combining particle methods and variational inference. While standard VSMC operates in the offline mode, by re-processing repeatedly a given batch of data, we distribute the approximation of the gradient of the VSMC surrogate ELBO in time using stochastic approximation, allowing for online learning in the presence of streams of data. This results in an algorithm, online VSMC, that is capable of performing efficiently, entirely on-the-fly, both parameter estimation and particle proposal adaptation. In addition, we provide rigorous theoretical results describing the algorithm's convergence properties as the number of data tends to infinity as well as numerical illustrations of its excellent convergence properties and usefulness also in batch-processing settings.</description>

      <title>The Gossiping Insert-Eliminate Algorithm for Multi-Agent Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret. In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.</description>

      <title>Malign Overfitting: Interpolation Can Provably Preclude Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned classifiers should often possess certain invariance properties meant to encourage fairness, robustness, or out-of-distribution generalization. However, multiple recent works empirically demonstrate that common invariance-inducing regularizers are ineffective in the over-parameterized regime, in which classifiers perfectly fit (i.e. interpolate) the training data. This suggests that the phenomenon of "benign overfitting", in which models generalize well despite interpolating, might not favorably extend to settings in which robustness or fairness are desirable.
  In this work we provide a theoretical justification for these observations. We prove that -- even in the simplest of settings -- any interpolating learning rule (with arbitrarily small margin) will not satisfy these invariance properties. We then propose and analyze an algorithm that -- in the same setting -- successfully learns a non-interpolating classifier that is provably invariant. We validate our theoretical observations on simulated data and the Waterbirds dataset.</description>

      <title>Are demographically invariant models and representations in medical imaging fair?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging models have been shown to encode information about patient demographics such as age, race, and sex in their latent representation, raising concerns about their potential for discrimination. Here, we ask whether requiring models not to encode demographic attributes is desirable. We point out that marginal and class-conditional representation invariance imply the standard group fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds, respectively. In addition, however, they require matching the risk distributions, thus potentially equalizing away important group differences. Enforcing the traditional fairness notions directly instead does not entail these strong constraints. Moreover, representationally invariant models may still take demographic attributes into account for deriving predictions, implying unequal treatment - in fact, achieving representation invariance may require doing so. In theory, this can be prevented using counterfactual notions of (individual) fairness or invariance. We caution, however, that properly defining medical image counterfactuals with respect to demographic attributes is fraught with challenges. Finally, we posit that encoding demographic attributes may even be advantageous if it enables learning a task-specific encoding of demographic features that does not rely on social constructs such as 'race' and 'gender.' We conclude that demographically invariant representations are neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness in medical imaging. Models may need to encode demographic attributes, lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive model fairness assessments in terms of predictive performance across diverse patient groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of collaborative multi-agent bandits has attracted significant attention recently. In light of this, we initiate the study of a new collaborative setting, consisting of $N$ agents such that each agent is learning one of $M$ stochastic multi-armed bandits to minimize their group cumulative regret. We develop decentralized algorithms which facilitate collaboration between the agents under two scenarios. We characterize the performance of these algorithms by deriving the per agent cumulative regret and group regret upper bounds. We also prove lower bounds for the group regret in this setting, which demonstrates the near-optimal behavior of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Regret Minimization in Offline Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to make decisions that minimize Bayesian regret in offline linear bandits. Prior work suggests that one must take actions with maximum lower confidence bound (LCB) on their reward. We argue that the reliance on LCB is inherently flawed in this setting and propose a new algorithm that directly minimizes upper bounds on the Bayesian regret using efficient conic optimization solvers. Our bounds build heavily on new connections to monetary risk measures. Proving a matching lower bound, we show that our upper bounds are tight, and by minimizing them we are guaranteed to outperform the LCB approach. Our numerical results on synthetic domains confirm that our approach is superior to LCB.</description>

      <title>How Deep Neural Networks Learn Compositional Data: The Random Hierarchy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms demonstrate a surprising ability to learn high-dimensional tasks from limited examples. This is commonly attributed to the depth of neural networks, enabling them to build a hierarchy of abstract, low-dimensional data representations. However, how many training examples are required to learn such representations remains unknown. To quantitatively study this question, we introduce the Random Hierarchy Model: a family of synthetic tasks inspired by the hierarchical structure of language and images. The model is a classification task where each class corresponds to a group of high-level features, chosen among several equivalent groups associated with the same class. In turn, each feature corresponds to a group of sub-features chosen among several equivalent ones and so on, following a hierarchy of composition rules. We find that deep networks learn the task by developing internal representations invariant to exchanging equivalent groups. Moreover, the number of data required corresponds to the point where correlations between low-level features and classes become detectable. Overall, our results indicate how deep networks overcome the curse of dimensionality by building invariant representations, and provide an estimate of the number of data required to learn a hierarchical task.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Solving Wasserstein Lagrangian Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical formulation of the optimal transport can be extended through various choices of the underlying geometry (kinetic energy), and the regularization of density paths (potential energy). These combinations yield different variational problems (Lagrangians), encompassing many variations of the optimal transport problem such as the Schr\"odinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with physical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal density path is unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally challenging. We propose a novel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from a unified perspective. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, our method does not require simulating or backpropagating through the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to optimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by outperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference, where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correct predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic study of the approximation properties of Transformer for sequence modeling with long, sparse and complicated memory. We investigate the mechanisms through which different components of Transformer, such as the dot-product self-attention, positional encoding and feed-forward layer, affect its expressive power, and we study their combined effects through establishing explicit approximation rates. Our study reveals the roles of critical parameters in the Transformer, such as the number of layers and the number of attention heads. These theoretical insights are validated experimentally and offer natural suggestions for alternative architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Optimal Covariance-Adaptive Algorithms for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player selects among $P$ actions from the power set of a set containing $d$ base items. Adaptivity to the problem's structure is essential in order to obtain optimal regret upper bounds. As estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix can be manageable in practice, leveraging them should improve the regret. We design ``optimistic'' covariance-adaptive algorithms relying on online estimations of the covariance structure, called OLSUCBC and COSV (only the variances for the latter). They both yields improved gap-free regret. Although COSV can be slightly suboptimal, it improves on computational complexity by taking inspiration from Thompson Sampling approaches. It is the first sampling-based algorithm satisfying a $\sqrt{T}$ gap-free regret (up to poly-logs). We also show that in some cases, our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where $P\gg d$ but also when $P\leq d$, which is not covered by existing analyses.</description>

      <title>NeuraLUT: Hiding Neural Network Density in Boolean Synthesizable Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerators have proven successful in handling latency- and resource-critical deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks. Among the most computationally intensive operations in a neural network (NN) is the dot product between the feature and weight vectors. Thus, some previous FPGA acceleration works have proposed mapping neurons with quantized inputs and outputs directly to lookup tables (LUTs) for hardware implementation. In these works, the boundaries of the neurons coincide with the boundaries of the LUTs. We propose relaxing these boundaries and mapping entire sub-networks to a single LUT. As the sub-networks are absorbed within the LUT, the NN topology and precision within a partition do not affect the size of the lookup tables generated. Therefore, we utilize fully connected layers with floating-point precision inside each partition, which benefit from being universal function approximators, but with rigid sparsity and quantization enforced between partitions, where the NN topology becomes exposed to the circuit topology. Although cheap to implement, this approach can lead to very deep NNs, and so to tackle challenges like vanishing gradients, we also introduce skip connections inside the partitions. The resulting methodology can be seen as training DNNs with a specific FPGA hardware-inspired sparsity pattern that allows them to be mapped to much shallower circuit-level networks, thereby significantly improving latency. We validate our proposed method on a known latency-critical task, jet substructure tagging, and on the classical computer vision task, digit classification using MNIST. Our approach allows for greater function expressivity within the LUTs compared to existing work, leading to up to $4.3\times$ lower latency NNs for the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multiply-Robust Causal Change Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. Our method is implemented as part of the Python library DoWhy (arXiv:2011.04216, arXiv:2206.06821).</description>
