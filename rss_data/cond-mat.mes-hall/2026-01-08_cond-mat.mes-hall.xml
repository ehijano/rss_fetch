      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect from non-collinear compensated magnetism in Mn$_3$Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Superconducting Diode Effect in Mn$_{3}$Pt/Nb Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Wigner solid or Anderson solid -- 2D electrons in strong disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.</description>

      <title>The emergence of net chirality in two-dimensional Dirac fermions system with altermagnetic mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional lattice systems, massless Dirac fermions undergo doubling, leading to the cancellation of net chirality. We demonstrate that the recently discovered altermagnetism can induce a unique mass term, the altermagnetic mass term, which gaps out Dirac cones with one chirality while maintaining the other gapless, leading to the emergence of net chirality. The surviving gapless Dirac cones retain identical winding numbers and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the trivial constant mass term. When subjected to an external magnetic field, the altermagnetic mass induces Landau level asymmetry in Dirac fermions, resulting in fully valley-polarized quantum Hall edge states. Our findings reveal that Dirac fermions with the altermagnetic mass harbor rich physical phenomena warranting further exploration.</description>

      <title>Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</description>

      <title>Comments on the formula to extract current-induced torques from the harmonic Hall voltage measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the formulas commonly used to estimate current-induced spin-orbit torques from harmonic Hall voltage measurements. In particular, we focus on the factor of two discrepancy among expressions employed to fit harmonic Hall signals measured under an in-plane rotating magnetic field. By explicitly deriving the relevant relations, we clarify the origin of this discrepancy and present the correct form of the fitting formula. We further discuss the determination of the sign of the field-like torque from harmonic Hall voltage measurements, which depends on the assumed form of the current-induced torques.</description>

      <title>Koopman Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.</description>

      <title>Electric-current control of anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto heat-engine with Kitaev-Heisenberg cluster: Possible roles of frustration, magnons, and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) clusters as working media realizing a quantum Otto engine (QOE). An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($\kappa$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $\kappa$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $\kappa$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$. The results could be of practical interest for materials with KH interactions as a platform for QOE.</description>

      <title>A current source with metrological precision made on a 300mm silicon MOS process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the measurement of current is now defined with respect to the electronic charge, producing a current standard based on a single-electron source remains challenging. The error rate of a source must be below 0.01 ppm, and many such sources must be operated in parallel to provide practically useful values of current in the nanoampere range. Achieving a single electron source using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer silicon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process could offer a powerful route for scaling, combined with the ability for integration with control and measurement electronics. Here, we present measurements of such a single-electron source indicating an error rate of 0.008 ppm, below the error threshold to satisfy the SI Ampere, and one of the lowest error rates reported, implemented using a gate-defined quantum dot device fabricated on an industry-grade silicon MOS process. Further evidence supporting the accuracy of the device is obtained by comparing the device performance to established models of quantum tunnelling, which reveal the mechanism of operation of our source at the single particle level. The low error rate observed in this device motivates the development of scaled arrays of parallel sources utilising Si MOS devices to realise a new generation of metrologically accurate current standards.</description>

      <title>Layer Hall effect induced by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a scheme to realize the layer Hall effect in the ferromagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via proximity to $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that an altermagnet and an in-plane magnetic field applied near one surface gap the corresponding Dirac cone, yielding an altermagnet-induced half-quantized Hall effect. When altermagnets with antiparallel N\'{e}el vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel N\'{e}el vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field. Our results establish a route to engineer altermagnet-induced topological phases in ferromagnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-mode electron shuttling through a T-junction in Si/SiGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\times 10^{-7}}\,\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Magneto-mechanical reservoir computing combining a two-dimensional network of nonlinear mass-spring resonators with magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled networks of mass-spring resonators have attracted growing attention across multiple fundamental and applied research directions, including reservoir computing for artificial intelligence. This has led to the exploration of platforms capable of tasks such as acoustic-wave classification, smart sensing, predictive maintenance, and adaptive vibration control. This work introduces a multiphysics reservoir based on a two-dimensional network of coupled nonlinear mass-spring resonators. Each mass has a magnetic tunnel junction on top of it, working as spin diode, used as a spintronic read-out. As a proof-of-concept, we have benchmarked this reservoir with the task of vowel-recognition reaching accuracy above 95$\%$. Because the device accepts elastic excitations directly, signal injections are simplified, making it well-suited for realtime sensing and edge computation. We also studied the effect of nonlinearity, demonstrating how it influences the reservoir dynamics, and assessed its robustness under node-to-node variation of the elastic constants.</description>

      <title>Extended imaginary gauge transformation in a general nonreciprocal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12785v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaginary gauge transformation (IGT) provides a clear understanding of the non-Hermitian skin effect by transforming the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra into Hermitian ones. In this paper, we extend this approach to the complex spectrum regime in a general nonreciprocal lattice model. We unveil the validity of IGT hinges on a class of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. The generalized Brillouin zone of Hamiltonians respect such pseudo-Hermiticity is demonstrated to be a circle, which enables easy access to the continuum bands, localization length of skin modes, and relevant topological numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of IGT and the underlying pseudo-Hermiticity beyond nearest-neighbor hopping, offering a graphical interpretation. Our theoretical framework is applied to establish bulk-boundary correspondence in the nonreciprocal trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and to analyze the localization behaviors of skin modes in the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Even-Parity Unidirectional Spin Splitting in Coplanar Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03358</link>

Abstract: When a coplanar antiferromagnet (AFM) with $xy$-plane magnetic moments exhibits a spin-split band structure and unidirectional spin polarization along $z$, the spin polarization is forced to be an odd function of momentum by the fundamental symmetry $[\bar{C}_{2z}\|\mathcal{T}]$. Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\bar{C}_{2z}|\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings.</description>

      <title>Scalar vacuum densities on Beltrami pseudosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on the (2+1)-dimensional Beltrami pseudosphere, assuming that the field obeys quasiperiodicity condition with constant phase. As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate.</description>

      <title>Topological Sensing in the Dynamics of Quantum Walks with Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum sensing leverages unique topological features to suppress noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation, emerging as a promising tool in both fundamental research and practical application. In this Letter, we propose a sensing protocol that exploits the dynamics of topological quantum walks incorporating localized defects. Unlike conventional schemes that rely on topological protection to suppress disorder and defects, our protocol harnesses the evolution time as a resource to enable precise estimation of the defect parameter. By utilizing topologically nontrivial properties of the quantum walks, the sensing precision can approach the Heisenberg limit. We further demonstrate the performance and robustness of the protocol through Bayesian estimation. Our results show that this approach maintains high precision over a broad range of parameters and exhibits strong robustness against disorder, offering a practical pathway for topologically enhanced quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of plasmonics and related applications in the terahertz range faces limitations due to the intrinsic high electron density of standard metals. All-dielectric systems are profitable alternatives, which allows for customized modulation of the optical response upon doping. Here we focus on plasmon-based hyperbolic metamaterials realized stacking doped III-V semiconductors that have been shown to be optically active in the terahertz spectral region. By using a multi-physics multi-scale theoretical approach, we unravel the role of doping and geometrical characteristics (e.g., thickness, composition, grating) in the modulation of high-k plasmon-polariton modes across the metamaterial.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the half-quantized Hall effect phase in a three-dimensional (3D) semi-magnetic topological insulator [M. Mogi et al., Nature Physics 18, 390 (2022)], we propose a scheme for realizing the half-quantized Hall effect and axion insulator in experimentally mature 3D topological insulator heterostructures. Our approach involves optically pumping and/or magnetically doping the topological insulator surface, such as to break time reversal and gap out the Dirac cones. By toggling between left and right circularly polarized optical pumping, the sign of the half-integer Hall conductance from each of the surface Dirac cones can be controlled, such as to yield half-quantized ($0+1/2$), axion ($-1/2+1/2=0$), and Chern ($1/2+1/2=1$) insulator phases. We substantiate our results based on detailed band structure and Berry curvature numerics on the Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency limit. Our paper showcases how topological phases can be obtained through mature experimental approaches such as magnetic layer doping and circularly polarized laser pumping and opens up potential device applications such as a polarization chirality-controlled topological transistor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isospin flavors in condensed matters can be continuously broken, forming various symmetry-broken quantum states. In moir\'e crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be effectively tuned by the twist angles and staciking orders. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moir\'e dependent topological phenomena. In devices with small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moir\'e filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator as well as multiple first-order transitions between different symmetry-broken phases. Interestly, in the device with a slightly larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional moir\'e fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is abscent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands form rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study tunable high Chern insulators as well as new devices for quantum storage and computation.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of bilayer excitonic insulators: from exciton London equations to dipole and inverse dipole Hall effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of the linear electromagnetic response of bilayer excitonic insulators relevant to electron-hole double-layer systems. Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock description of the excitonic ground state and time-dependent Hartree-Fock for its dynamics, we compute the collective mode spectrum and the full first-order response to layer-symmetric (charge) and layer-antisymmetric (exciton) gauge fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that two gapped plasmon modes dominate the long-wavelength charge response, while the exciton channel is governed by a linearly dispersing phase (Goldstone) mode. From the Goldstone-dominated kernel we derive a London-like equation for the exciton condensate, demonstrating non-dissipative acceleration under a layer-antisymmetric electric field, which we identify as the direct evidence of exciton superfluid; in contrast, a normal exciton fluid shows a Drude-like, dissipative response. In a perpendicular magnetic field, the Goldstone mode develops a magnetic-roton minimum that signals an instability toward a finite-momentum stripe-ordered excitonic insulator. Besides, charge and exciton motions become coupled under the field, giving rise to dipole and inverse dipole Hall effects in which a charge (exciton) bias induces a transverse exciton (charge) current. As a manifestation of the exciton superfluidity, these mixed Hall responses remain finite even in the DC limit. Our findings provide concrete targets for microwave and transport probes of bilayer exciton superfluidity.</description>

Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.</description>

Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission -- including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$ -- and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We show that proximity to an altermagnet provides an efficient route to engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</description>

Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</description>

      <title>Dynamically tuneable helicity in twisted electromagnetic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality, through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by $\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$, a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$. In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong photon-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>
