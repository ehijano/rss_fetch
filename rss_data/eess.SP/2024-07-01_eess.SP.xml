      <title>Localization in Multipath Environments via Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an uplink pilot-based wireless indoor localization problem in a multipath environment for a single-input single-output (SISO) narrowband communication system aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The indoor localization problem is challenging because the uplink channel consists of multiple overlapping propagation paths with varying amplitudes and phases, which are not easy to differentiate. This paper proposes the use of RIS capable of adaptively changing its reflection pattern to sense such a multiplepath environment. Toward this end, we train a long-short-termmemory (LSTM) based controller to perform adaptive sequential reconfigurations of the RIS over multiple stages and propose to group multiple pilots as input in each stage. Information from the multiple paths is captured by training the LSTM to generate multiple RIS configurations to align to the different paths within each stage. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in significantly reducing training complexity while maintaining localization performance at fixed number of pilots.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Movable Antenna-Assisted Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless communications recently due to their ability to create favorable channel conditions via local antenna movement within a confined region. In this letter, we advance their application for cognitive radio to facilitate efficient spectrum sharing between primary and secondary communication systems. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and MA positions at a secondary transmitter (ST) to maximize the received signal power at a secondary receiver (SR) subject to the constraints on its imposed co-channel interference power with multiple primary receivers (PRs). However, such an optimization problem is difficult to be optimally solved due to the highly nonlinear functions of the received signal/interference power at the SR/all PRs in terms of the MA positions. To drive useful insights, we first perform theoretical analyses to unveil MAs' capability to achieve maximum-ratio transmission with the SR and effective interference mitigation for all PRs at the same time. To solve the MA position optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Functional Basis Analysis for the Characterization of Power System Signal Dynamics: Formulation, Implementation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of distributed energy resources and the trend towards low-inertia power grids, the frequency and severity of grid dynamics is expected to increase. Conventional phasor-based signal processing methods are proving to be insufficient in the analysis of non-stationary AC voltage and current waveforms, while the computational complexity of many dynamic signal analysis techniques hinders their deployment in operational embedded systems. This paper presents the Functional Basis Analysis (FBA), a signal processing tool capable of capturing the full broadband nature of signal dynamics in power grids while maintaining a streamlined design for real-time monitoring applications. Relying on the Hilbert transform and optimization techniques, the FBA can be user-engineered to identify and characterize combinations of several of the most common signal dynamics in power grids, including amplitude/phase modulations, frequency ramps and steps. This paper describes the theoretical basis and design of the FBA as well as the deployment of the algorithm in embedded hardware systems, with adaptations made to consider latency requirements, finite memory capacity, and fixed-point precision arithmetic. For validation, a PMU calibrator is used to evaluate and compare the algorithm's performance to state-of-the-art static and dynamic phasor methods. The test outcomes demonstrate the FBA method's suitability for implementation in embedded systems to improve grid situational awareness during severe grid events.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformer for IRS-Assisted Systems with Diffusion-Driven Generative Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-decision transformer (D2T) architecture to optimize the beamforming strategies for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems. The first challenge lies in the expensive computation cost to recover the real-time channel state information (CSI) from the received pilot signals, which usually requires prior knowledge of the channel distributions. To reduce the channel estimation complexity, we adopt a diffusion model to automatically learn the mapping between the received pilot signals and channel matrices in a model-free manner. The second challenge is that, the traditional optimization or reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms cannot guarantee the optimality of the beamforming policies once the channel distribution changes, and it is costly to resolve the optimized strategies. To enhance the generality of the decision models over varying channel distributions, we propose an offline pre-training and online fine-tuning decision transformer (DT) framework, wherein we first pre-train the DT offline with the data samples collected by the RL algorithms under diverse channel distributions, and then fine-tune the DT online with few-shot samples under a new channel distribution for a generalization purpose. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with retraining RL algorithms, the proposed D2T algorithm boosts the convergence speed by 3 times with only a few samples from the new channel distribution while enhancing the average user data rate by 6%.</description>

      <title>Frequency Modulation for Task-Oriented Communications and Multiple Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of task-oriented communications we advocate the development of waveforms for Federated Edge Learning (FEEL). Over-the-air computing (AirComp) has emerged as a communication scheme that allows to compute a function out of distributed data and can be applied to FEEL. However, the design of modulations for AirComp is still in its infancy and most of the literature ignores this topic. In this work we employ frequency modulation (FM) and type based multiple access (TMBA) for FEEL and demonstrate its advantages with respect to the state of the art in terms of convergence and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).</description>

      <title>LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs.
  In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</description>

      <title>On Counterfactual Interventions in Vector Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning allows us to explore hypothetical scenarios in order to explain the impacts of our decisions. However, addressing such inquires is impossible without establishing the appropriate mathematical framework. In this work, we introduce the problem of counterfactual reasoning in the context of vector autoregressive (VAR) processes. We also formulate the inference of a causal model as a joint regression task where for inference we use both data with and without interventions. After learning the model, we exploit linearity of the VAR model to make exact predictions about the effects of counterfactual interventions. Furthermore, we quantify the total causal effects of past counterfactual interventions.

      <description>arXiv:2406.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent advances in deep learning (DL) techniques for the channel coding problems. Inspired by the recent successes of DL in a variety of research domains, its applications to the physical layer technologies have been extensively studied in recent years, and are expected to be a potential breakthrough in supporting the emerging use cases of the next generation wireless communication systems such as 6G. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the channel coding problems and review existing approaches that incorporate advanced DL techniques into code design and channel decoding. After briefly introducing the background of recent DL techniques, we categorize and summarize a variety of approaches, including model-free and mode-based DL, for the design and decoding of modern error-correcting codes, such as low-density parity check (LDPC) codes and polar codes, to highlight their potential advantages and challenges. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of open issues and future research directions in channel coding.</description>

Abstract: With the deployment of satellite constellations, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in remote areas have gained access to low-cost network connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the performance of IoT devices connecting in up-link through low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) links. We model the dynamic LEO satellite constellation using the stochastic geometry method and provide an analysis of end-to-end availability with low-complexity and coverage performance estimates for the mentioned link. Based on the analytical expressions derived in this research, we make a sound investigation on the impact of constellation configuration, transmission power, and the relative positions of IoT devices and GEO satellites on end-to-end performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for subgraph matching, the problem of finding a given query graph in a large source graph, based on the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We formulate the subgraph matching problem as a partial fused Gromov-Wasserstein problem, which allows us to build on existing theory and computational methods in order to solve this challenging problem. We extend our method by employing a subgraph sliding approach, which makes it efficient even for large graphs. In numerical experiments, we showcase that our new algorithms have the ability to outperform state-of-the-art methods for subgraph matching on synthetic as well as realworld datasets. In particular, our methods exhibit robustness with respect to noise in the datasets and achieve very fast query times.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and non-hyperuniformity of zeros of Gaussian Weyl-Heisenberg Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study zero sets of twisted stationary Gaussian random functions on the complex plane, i.e., Gaussian random functions that are stochastically invariant under the action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. This model includes translation invariant Gaussian entire functions (GEFs), and also many other non-analytic examples, in which case winding numbers around zeros can be either positive or negative. We investigate zero statistics both when zeros are weighted with their winding numbers (charged zero set) and when they are not (uncharged zero set).
  We show that the variance of the charged zero statistic always grows linearly with the radius of the observation disk (hyperuniformity). Importantly, this holds for functions with possibly non-zero means and without assuming additional symmetries such as radiality. With respect to uncharged zero statistics, we provide an example for which the variance grows with the area of the observation disk (non-hyperuniformity). This is used to show that, while the zeros of GEFs are hyperuniform, the set of their critical points fails to be so.
  Our work contributes to recent developments in statistical signal processing, where the time-frequency profile of a non-stationary signal embedded into noise is revealed by performing a statistical test on the zeros of its spectrogram (``silent points''). We show that empirical spectrogram zero counts enjoy moderate deviation from their ensemble averages over large observation windows (something that was previously known only for pure noise). In contrast, we also show that spectogram maxima (``loud points") fail to enjoy a similar property. This gives the first formal evidence for the statistical superiority of silent points over the competing feature of loud points, a fact that has been noted by practitioners.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present DISC, a dataset of millimeter-wave channel impulse response measurements for integrated human activity sensing and communication. This is the first dataset collected with a software-defined radio testbed that transmits 60 GHz IEEE 802-11ay-compliant packets and estimates the channel response including reflections of the signal on the moving body parts of subjects moving in an indoor environment. The provided data contain the contribution of 7 subjects performing 4 different activities. Differently from available radar-based millimeter-wave sensing datasets, our measurements are collected using both uniform packet transmission times and sparse traffic patterns from real Wi-Fi deployments. Thanks to these unique characteristics, DISC serves as a multi-purpose benchmarking tool for machine learning-based human activity recognition, radio frequency gait analysis, and sparse sensing algorithms for next-generation integrated sensing and communication.</description>

Abstract: **PLEASE FIND THE FULL EXTENDED ARTICLE "From OTFS to AFDM: A Comparative Study of Next-Generation Waveforms for ISAC in Doubly-Dispersive Channels" (Accepted for publication at the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine - Special Issue on Signal Processing for the Integrated Sensing and Communications Revolution)**
  This white paper aims to briefly describe a proposed article that will provide a thorough comparative study of waveforms designed to exploit the features of doubly-dispersive channels arising in heterogeneous high-mobility scenarios as expected in the beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G), in relation to their suitability to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. In particular, the full article will compare the well-established delay-Doppler domain-based orthognal time frequency space (OTFS) and the recently proposed chirp domain-based affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveforms. Both these waveforms are designed based on a full delay- Doppler representation of the time variant (TV) multipath channel, yielding not only robustness and orthogonality of information symbols in high-mobility scenarios, but also a beneficial implication for environment target detection through the inherent capability of estimating the path delay and Doppler shifts, which are standard radar parameters. These modulation schemes are distinct candidates for ISAC in B5G/6G systems, such that a thorough study of their advantages, shortcomings, implications to signal processing, and performance of communication and sensing functions are well in order. In light of the above, a sample of the intended contribution (Special Issue paper) is provided below.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation wireless systems will offer integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) functionalities not only in order to enable new applications, but also as a means to mitigate challenges such as doubly-dispersive channels, which arise in high mobility scenarios and/or at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands. An emerging approach to accomplish these goals is the design of new waveforms, which draw from the inherent relationship between the doubly-dispersive nature of time-variant (TV) channels and the environmental features of scatterers manifested in the form of multi-path delays and Doppler shifts. Examples of such waveforms are the delay-Doppler domain orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and the recently proposed chirp domain affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), both of which seek to simultaneously combat the detrimental effects of double selectivity and exploit them for the estimation (or sensing) of environmental information. This article aims to provide a consolidated and comprehensive overview of the signal processing techniques required to support reliable ISAC over doubly-dispersive channels in beyond fifth generation (B5G)/sixth generation (6G) systems, with an emphasis on OTFS and AFDM waveforms, as those, together with the traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, suffice to elaborate on the most relevant properties of the trend. The analysis shows that OTFS and AFDM indeed enable significantly improved robustness against inter-carrier interference (ICI) arising from Doppler shifts compared to OFDM. In addition, the inherent delay-Doppler domain orthogonality of the OTFS and AFDM effective channels is found to provide significant advantages for the design and the performance of integrated sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>Linear Periodically Time-Variant Digital PLL Phase Noise Modeling Using Conversion Matrices and Uncorrelated Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conversion matrix method for linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) phase noise modeling that offers precise and computationally efficient results to enable rapid design iteration and optimization. Unlike many previous studies, which either assume linear time-invariance (LTI) and therefore overlook phase noise aliasing effects, or solve LPTV systems with noise folding and multiple sampling rate conversions that heightens modeling and computational complexity, the proposed conversion matrix method allows the designer to represent LPTV systems using intuitive LTI-like transfer functions with excellent accuracy. Additionally, the uncorrelated upsampling method addresses the cross-correlated spectrum of cyclostationary noise sources by a simple matrix multiplication. This eliminates the need to consider the beat frequency of the upsampled noise source and the system with different sampling rates, thus improving computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is applied to modeling a integer-N DPLL with time-varying proportional loop gain, and the modeling accuracy is validated with Simulink transient simulations.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which samples of future time series are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</description>

      <title>Ground-to-UAV sub-Terahertz channel measurement and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communications have been expected to play a vital role in the next generation of wireless networks. UAVs can serve as either repeaters or data collectors within the communication link, thereby potentially augmenting the efficacy of communication systems. Despite their promise, the channel analysis and modeling specific to THz wireless channels leveraging UAVs remain under explored. This work delves into a ground-to-UAV channel at 140 GHz, with a specific focus on the influence of UAV hovering behavior on channel performance. Employing experimental measurements through an unmodulated channel setup and a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that integrates three-dimensional positional coordinates and beamwidth, this work evaluates the impact of UAV dynamic movements and antenna orientation on channel performance. Our findings highlight the minimal impact of UAV orientation adjustments on channel performance and underscore the diminishing necessity for precise alignment between UAVs and ground stations as beamwidth increases.</description>

      <title>Condition Monitoring with Incomplete Data: An Integrated Variational Autoencoder and Distance Metric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condition monitoring of industrial systems is crucial for ensuring safety and maintenance planning, yet notable challenges arise in real-world settings due to the limited or non-existent availability of fault samples. This paper introduces an innovative solution to this problem by proposing a new method for fault detection and condition monitoring for unseen data. Adopting an approach inspired by zero-shot learning, our method can identify faults and assign a relative health index to various operational conditions. Typically, we have plenty of data on normal operations, some data on compromised conditions, and very few (if any) samples of severe faults. We use a variational autoencoder to capture the probabilistic distribution of previously seen and new unseen conditions. The health status is determined by comparing each sample's deviation from a normal operation reference distribution in the latent space. Faults are detected by establishing a threshold for the health indexes, allowing the model to identify severe, unseen faults with high accuracy, even amidst noise. We validate our approach using the run-to-failure IMS-bearing dataset and compare it with other methods. The health indexes generated by our model closely match the established descriptive model of bearing wear, attesting to the robustness and reliability of our method. These findings highlight the potential of our methodology in augmenting fault detection capabilities within industrial domains, thereby contributing to heightened safety protocols and optimized maintenance practices.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel and Data Estimation for Multiuser Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) algorithm for uplink multiuser extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. The initial channel estimation is formulated as a sparse reconstruction problem based on the angle and distance sparsity under the near-field propagation condition. This problem is solved using non-orthogonal pilots through an efficient low complexity two-stage compressed sensing algorithm. Furthermore, the initial channel estimates are refined by employing a JCDE framework driven by both non-orthogonal pilots and estimated data. The JCDE problem is solved by sequential expectation propagation (EP) algorithms, where the channel and data are alternately updated in an iterative manner. In the channel estimation phase, integrating Bayesian inference with a model-based deterministic approach provides precise estimations to effectively exploit the near-field characteristics in the beam-domain. In the data estimation phase, a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based filter is designed at each sub-array to address the correlation due to energy leakage in the beam-domain arising from the near-field effects. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed initial channel estimation and JCDE algorithm outperforms the state-ofthe-art approaches in terms of channel estimation, data detection, and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of regularization in the design of minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear filters. Using the relationship with statistical machine learning methods, using a Bayesian approach, the regularization parameter is found from the observed signals in a simple and automatic manner. The proposed approach is illustrated in system identification and beamforming examples, where the automatic regularization is shown to yield near-optimal results.</description>
