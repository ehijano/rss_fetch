      <title>Quantum Field Theory and the Limits of Reductionism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I suggest that the current situation in quantum field theory (QFT) provides some reason to question the universal validity of ontological reductionism. I argue that the renormalization group flow is reversible except at fixed points, which makes the relation between large and small distance scales quite symmetric in QFT, opening up at least the technical possibility of a non-reductionist approach to QFT. I suggest that some conceptual problems encountered within QFT may potentially be mitigated by moving to an alternative picture in which it is no longer the case that the large supervenes on the small. Finally, I explore some specific models in which a form of non-reductionism might be implemented, and consider the prospects for future development of these models.</description>

      <title>How are Entanglement Entropies Related to Entropy Bounds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we seek to understand what current knowledge of entanglement entropies suggests about the appropriate way to interpret the covariant entropy bound. We first begin by arguing that just as in the classical case, a universal bound on the von Neumann entropy could have either an epistemic or ontological origin. We then consider several possible ways of explaining the bound as a consequence of features of the entanglement entropy. We discuss consider area laws in condensed matter and quantum field theory, arguing that they suggest an epistemic reading of the bound. We also discuss the 'spacetime from entanglement' programme, arguing that entanglement alone may not be able to full ground spacetime topology, but it could potentially play a role in determining the spacetime metric, in which case it would potentially support a more ontological reading of the bound.</description>
