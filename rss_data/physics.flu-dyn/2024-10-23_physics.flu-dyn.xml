      <title>Extraction of initial dynamics of magnetic micro-convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex fluid flows are important in many real-life problems. For an in-depth understanding, new and more elaborate methods of flow description are necessary. Often experimental and numerical data are accumulated in large quantities however only simple flow properties are extracted. Here we show an approach that allows quantitative extraction of the initial dynamics for magnetic micro-convection. It analyzes the initial time dynamics of the Fourier coefficients of the 2D flow snapshots. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both numeric and experimental data. In addition, the method is refined to account for noise that can be present in real-world data. This method can serve as a tool to directly compare mathematical models with experiments.</description>

      <title>An implicit coupling framework for numerical simulations between hypersonic nonequilibrium flows and charring material thermal response in the presence of ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implicit coupling framework between hypersonic nonequilibrium flows and material thermal response is proposed for the numerical simulation of ablative thermal protection materials during its flight trajectory. Charring ablative materials, when subjected to aerodynamic heating from hypersonic flows, undergo complex processes such as ablation and pyrolysis, involving heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions. These multi-physical phenomena are simulated by a multicomponent material thermal response (MTR) solver that takes into account the complexity of component of pyrolysis gases. The species concentrations are calculated to improve the accuracy of transport and thermophysical parameters of pyrolysis gases. The MTR solver implements implicit time integration on finite difference discretization form to achieve higher efficiency. The numerical solutions of hypersonic flows and material thermal response are coupled through a gas-surface interaction interface based on surface mass and energy balance on the ablating surface. The coupled simulation employs the dual time-step technique, which introduces pseudo time step to improve temporal accuracy. The explicit coupling mechanism updates the interfacial quantities at physical time steps, which achieves higher computational efficiency, but introduces time discretization errors and numerical oscillations of interfacial quantities. In contrast, the implicit coupling mechanism updates the interfacial quantities at pseudo time steps, which reduces the temporal discretization error and suppresses numerical oscillations, but is less efficient. In addition, a simplified ablation boundary based on steady-state ablation assumption or radiation-equilibrium assumption is proposed to approximate solid heat conduction without coupling the MTR solution, providing quasi-steady flow solutions in the presence of ablation.</description>

      <title>Large-Eddy Simulations of Stochastic Burgers Turbulence Using Fully Conservative Higher-Order Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in turbulent flows continues to be a critical area of research, particularly in understanding the behavior of small-scale turbulence structures and their impact on resolved scales. In this study, we focus on the LES of turbulent flows, particularly the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE), using fully conservative higher-order schemes. The interaction between spatial discretization and SubGrid-Scale (SGS) modeling is explored rigorously by validating these schemes against analytical solutions for both the Linear Advection-Diffusion (LAD) equation and the Non-Linear Burgers (NLB) equation under laminar conditions. This ensures robustness before applying the approach to LES of stochastic turbulence. The study investigates how second-order and fourth-order discretization schemes influence the dynamic coefficients of various SGS models, including Constant Smagorinsky (CS), Dynamic Smagorinsky (DS), Dynamic Wong-Lilly (DWL), 1.5-order Turbulent Kinetic Energy Deardorff (TKED), Equilibrium Heinz (EH), and Dynamic Heinz (DH) models. The second-order scheme was found to amplify fluctuations in dynamic SGS coefficients due to its higher numerical dissipation, contrasting with the more stable behavior observed with the fourth order scheme, which better captures resolved scales and results in smaller dynamic coefficients. Despite inherent differences in SGS models and discretization schemes, the final velocity distributions in one dimensional turbulence simulations were remarkably consistent, suggesting a limited influence of SGS modeling on large-scale structures in simplified turbulence scenarios. However, notable variations in resolved-scale kinetic energy were uncovered, emphasizing the importance of accurately capturing small-scale turbulence structures for precise energy dissipation predictions in LES.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of an Accurate Algebraic Scheme for Sharp Interface Advection in Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an efficient algebraic scheme known as MULES for sharp interface advection, verified against various schemes including first-order upwind, second-order central, van Leer flux limiter, and Geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF). Two problems involving a droplet in a two-dimensional (2D) vortex and a stationary droplet were examined. The model assessed the effects of the Interface Compression (IC) coefficient, ranging from 0 to 2, analyzing parameters such as Interface Advection Error (IAE) and Mass Conservation Error (MCE). Results indicated that increasing IC values enhanced interface tracking accuracy but introduced non-physical instabilities at higher values, compromising mass conservation. Specifically, the IAE decreased from 4.8% to 3.95% as IC increased from 0 to 2, showing a favorable effect until IC surpassed 1.4, where IAE fluctuated around 4%. Conversely, the MCE rose steeply from 0% to 23.19%, driven by parasitic currents and numerical instabilities. Additionally, MULES and van Leer flux limiter schemes evaluated volume fraction smoothing effects. Initial filtering reduced Dimensionless Pressure Difference (DPD) and Capillary Number (Ca), stabilizing the solution, but excessive filtering reintroduced numerical errors and instabilities. With one filtering step, DPD reduced by 0.23 and Ca dropped significantly by 73.31%, improving solution stability. However, further filtering increased DPD and Ca, reflecting the reintroduction of numerical errors. The maximum velocity of parasitic flow around the droplet initially decreased by almost 75% but increased by 30.92% with excessive filtering. IAE increased from 0.7 to 0.9 with initial filtering, then decreased to 0.63 with additional steps, indicating improved solver performance on smoother interfaces.</description>

      <title>Modeling water infiltration into soil under fractional wettability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterogeneous distribution of water-repellent materials at the soil surface causes a phenomenon known as fractional wettability. This condition frequently triggers destabilization of the wetting front during water infiltration, resulting in the formation of fingered bypass flow. However, few analytical tools exist to understand and model this behavior. Moreover, existing infiltration models fail to fit certain infiltration curves that exist in experimental data. For these reasons, we introduce a novel infiltration model to simulate water infiltration under fractional wettable conditions. We conceptualize the soil surface as a composite of two distinct portions: a water-repellent fraction, where hydrophobic effects impede water infiltration, and a wettable fraction, where capillarity and gravity are the dominant forces controlling the process. The new model was validated using a dataset comprising infiltration data from 60 field measurements. Additionally, validation was performed using 660 analytically generated infiltration curves from six synthetic soils with varying textures. This innovative approach enabled us to account for the combined influence of these two fractions and to enhance the interpretation of infiltration curves with mixed shapes, which other common methods are unable to reproduce.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic thin film lubrication in finite width channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubricant viscoelasticity arises due to a finite polymer relaxation time ($\lambda$) and can provide beneficial effects. In applications, such as bearings, gears, biological joints, etc., where the height-to-length ratio is small ($H_0 / \ell_x$) and the shear due to the wall velocity ($U_0$) is high, a simplified two-dimensional computational analysis across the channel length and height reveals a finite increase in the load carrying capacity of the film purely due to polymer elasticity. In channels with a finite length-to-width ratio, $a$, the spanwise effects can be significant, but the resulting mathematical model is computationally intensive. In this work, we propose simpler reduced-order models, namely via a (i) first-order perturbation in the Deborah number ($\lambda U_0 / H_0$), and the (ii) viscoelastic Reynolds approach extended from \textit{Ahmed, H., \&amp; Biancofiore, L. (2021). A new approach for modeling viscoelastic thin film lubrication. Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 292, 104524}. We predict the variation in the net vertical force exerted on the channel walls (for a fixed film height) versus increasing viscoelasticity, and the channel aspect ratio. The models predict an increase in the net force, which is zero for the Newtonian case, versus both the Deborah number and the channel aspect ratio. Interestingly, for a fixed $De$, this force varies strongly between the two limiting cases (i) $a &lt;&lt; 1$; an infinitely wide, and (ii) $a &gt;&gt; 1$; an infinitely short channel channel, implying a change in the polymers response. Furthermore, we observe a different trend (i) for a spanwise varying channel, in which a peak is observed between the two limits, and (ii) for a spanwise uniform channel, where the largest load value is for $a &lt;&lt; 1$. When $a$ is O($1$), the viscoelastic response varies strongly and spanwise effects cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Plateau Instability on an angled and eccentric fiber: An alternative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the modulation of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability (RPI) by adjusting the orientation angle and eccentricity of a wire within a nozzle. We demonstrate that both the angle and eccentricity significantly influence the RPI regimes. They both also influence characteristics, such as velocity, wavelength, and droplet volume. Notably, when wires are both angled and eccentric, the effect of angle prevails. Our approach includes an empirical scaling analysis, comparing gravity, surface tension, and viscosity forces on a single bead, yielding a unified empirical viscous force law, enhancing understanding of RP regime dynamics. This new framework enriches our understanding of the forces at play in RPI and provides practical insights into the manipulation of fluid dynamics in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Modulating outcomes of oil drops bursting at a water-air interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that capillary waves generated by bursting of an oil drop at the water-air interface produces a daughter droplet inside the bath while part of it floats above it. Successive bursting events produce next generations of daughter droplets, gradually diminishing in size until the entire volume of oil rests atop the water-air interface. In this work, we demonstrate two different ways to modulate this process by modifying the constitution of the drop. Firstly, we introduce hydrophilic clay particles inside the parent oil drop and show that it arrests the cascade of daughter droplet generation preventing it from floating over the water-air interface. Secondly, we show that bursting behavior can be modified by a compound water-oil-air interface made of a film of oil with finite thickness and design a regime map which displays each of these outcomes. We underpin both of these demonstrations by theoretical arguments providing criteria to predict outcomes resulting therein. Lastly, all our scenarios have a direct relation to control of oil-water separation and stability of emulsified solutions in a wide variety of applications which include drug delivery, enhanced oil recovery, oil spills and food processing where a dispersed oil phase tries to separate from a continuous phase.</description>

      <title>Low Reynolds number pumping near an elastic half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on peristalsis, the pumping of fluid along a channel by wave-like displacements of the channel walls, have shown that the elastic properties of the channel and the peristaltic wave shape can influence the flow rate. Motivated by the oscillatory flow of cerebrospinal fluid along compliant perivascular spaces, we consider a prescribed wave motion of a single boundary which pumps fluid at small Reynolds number near an elastic half space. We investigate the relationship between flow rate and elastic deformation as a function of the fluid and solid properties. We consider transverse and longitudinal motion of the driving peristaltic wave. We find that a transverse peristaltic wave produces net forward flow and induces elastic motion in which all material points oscillate uniformly. Conversely, a longitudinal peristaltic wave produces a net backward flow and drives elastic motion which is nonuniform in the elastic solid. We use dimensional values relevant to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and find agreement with in vivo velocity data.</description>

      <title>High-Order Dynamic Integration Method (HODIM) for Modeling Turbulent Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the development and application of the High-Order Dynamic Integration Method for solving integro-differential equations, with a specific focus on turbulent fluid dynamics. Traditional numerical methods, such as the Finite Difference Method and the Finite Volume Method, have been widely employed in fluid dynamics but struggle to accurately capture the complexities of turbulence, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes. These methods often require significant computational resources and are prone to errors in nonlinear dynamic systems. The High-Order Dynamic Integration Method addresses these challenges by integrating higher-order interpolation techniques with dynamic adaptation strategies, significantly enhancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Through rigorous numerical analysis, this method demonstrates superior performance over the Finite Difference Method and the Finite Volume Method in handling the nonlinear behaviors characteristic of turbulent flows. Furthermore, the High-Order Dynamic Integration Method achieves this without a substantial increase in computational cost, making it a highly efficient tool for simulations in computational fluid dynamics. The research validates the capabilities of the High-Order Dynamic Integration Method through a series of benchmark tests and case studies. Results indicate a marked improvement in both accuracy and stability, particularly in simulations of high-Reynolds-number flows, where traditional methods often falter. This innovative approach offers a robust and efficient alternative for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, contributing to advances in the field of numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evaporating sessile droplets: solutal Marangoni effects overwhelm thermal Marangoni flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an evaporating water droplet is deposited on a thermally conductive substrate, the minimum temperature will be at the apex due to evaporative cooling. Consequently, density and surface tension gradients emerge within the droplet and at the droplet-gas interface, giving rise to competing flows from, respectively, the apex towards the contact line (thermal-buoyancy-driven flow) and the other way around (thermal Marangoni flow). In small droplets with a diameter below the capillary length, the thermal Marangoni effects are expected to dominate over thermal buoyancy ("thermal Rayleigh") effects. However, contrary to these theoretical predictions, our experiments mostly show a dominant circulation from the apex towards the contact line, indicating a prevailing of thermal Rayleigh convection. Furthermore, our experiments often show an unexpected asymmetric flow that persisted for several minutes. We hypothesise that a tiny amount of contaminants, commonly encountered in experiments with water/air interfaces, act as surfactants and counteract the thermal surface tension gradients at the interface and thereby promote the dominance of Rayleigh convection. Our finite element numerical simulations demonstrate that, under our specified experimental conditions, a mere 0.5% reduction in the static surface tension caused by surfactants leads to a reversal in the flow direction, compared to the theoretical prediction without contaminants. Additionally, we investigate the linear stability of the axisymmetric solutions, revealing that the presence of surfactants also affects the axial symmetry of the flow.</description>

      <title>Flutter stability of twin-box bridge decks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17097v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper reports on wind tunnel tests and analyses carried out to investigate the effect of the static angle of attack on the aerodynamic stability of a twin-box bridge deck section. It is found that the critical wind speed for onset of flutter increases with increasing positive static angles (nose-up) and that this effect relates mainly to a decrease in the loss of aerodynamic stiffness. A simplified flutter analysis, linking the slope of the static moment coefficient to the increase of flutter stability for increasing positive angles of attack. It is concluded that it is desirable to design twin-box bridge deck sections to have a positive moment coefficient at zero angle of attack and a positive, decreasing moment slope for increasing nose-up angles. With these requirements fulfilled, the present study show that the critical wind speeds for onset of flutter increase with increasing angles, and ensures that the elastically supported deck will always meet the wind at ever increasing angles for increasing wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>A gas-surface interaction algorithm for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows: For Maxwell boundary model</title>

Abstract: The rarefied flow and multi-scale flow are crucial for the aerodynamic design of spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete velocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can capture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow behaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied regimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other multi-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and plasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the gas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and unified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be regarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full accommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending DVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real multi-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework by constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an adjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems of macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well solved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function and interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that the multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is essential. From the perspective of generality, the GSI is forced on UVS. Besides, by combined with the unified method (the unified gas-kinetic scheme in the paper), the effectiveness and validity of the present GSI on the DVM framework are verified by a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>Spanwise wall forcing can reduce turbulent heat transfer more than drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations are performed of turbulent forced convection in a half channel flow with wall oscillating either as a spanwise plane oscillation or to generate a streamwise travelling wave. The friction Reynolds number is fixed at $Re_{\tau_0} = 590$, but the Prandtl number $Pr$ is varied from 0.71 to 20. For $Pr&gt;1$, the heat transfer is reduced by more than the drag, 40\% compared to 30\% at $Pr=7.5$. This outcome is related to the different responses of the velocity and thermal fields to the Stokes layer. It is shown that the Stokes layer near the wall attenuates the large-scale energy of the turbulent heat-flux and the turbulent shear-stress, but amplifies their small-scale energy. At higher Prandtl numbers, the thinning of the conductive sublayer means that the energetic scales of the turbulent heat-flux move closer to the wall, where they are exposed to a stronger Stokes layer production, increasing the contribution of the small-scale energy amplification. A predictive model is derived for the Reynolds and Prandtl number dependence of the heat-transfer reduction based on the scaling of the thermal statistics. The model agrees well with the computations for Prandtl numbers up to 20.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>

Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [{\it A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes.}, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We validate our numerical method on several canonical problems including the method of manufactured solutions. We also present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>Consistent multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we notice that a pressure-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was established to recover the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE), which serve as the cornerstone of various fluid-solid multiphase models. It decouples the pressure from density and exhibits excellent numerical performance, however, the widely adopted density-based LB scheme still suffers from significant spurious velocities and inconsistency with VANSE. To remedy this issue, a multiple-relaxation-time LB method is devised in this work, which incorporates a provisional equation of state in an adjusted density equilibrium distribution to decouple the void fraction from density. The Galilean invariance of the recovered VANSE is guaranteed by introducing a penalty source term in moment space, effectively eliminating unwanted numerical errors. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis and detailed numerical validations, this novel method is proved to be capable of recovering VANSE with second-order accuracy consistently, and well-suited for handling void fraction fields with large gradients and spatiotemporal distributions.</description>

      <title>Conservative discontinuous Galerkin method for supercritical, real-fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a conservative discontinuous Galerkin method for the simulation of supercritical and transcritical real-fluid flows without phase separation. A well-known issue associated with the use of fully conservative schemes is the generation of spurious pressure oscillations at contact interfaces, which are exacerbated when a cubic equation of state and thermodynamic relations appropriate for this high-pressure flow regime are considered. To reduce these pressure oscillations, which can otherwise lead to solver divergence in the absence of additional dissipation, an L2-projection of primitive variables is performed in the evaluation of the flux. We apply the discontinuous Galerkin formulation to a variety of test cases. The first case is the advection of a sinusoidal density wave, which is used to verify the convergence of the scheme. The next two involve one- and two-dimensional advection of a nitrogen/n-dodecane thermal bubble, in which the ability of the methodology to reduce pressure oscillations and maintain solution stability is assessed. The final test cases consist of two- and three-dimensional injection of an n-dodecane jet into a nitrogen chamber.</description>

      <title>Noise-expansion cascade: an origin of randomness of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence has remained the greatest challenge in fluid mechanics. Especially, randomness is one of the most important characteristics of turbulence, but its origin is still an open question until now. In this paper, by means of several ingeniously designed ``clean'' numerical experiments based on Navier-Stokes equations for the two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal such a new phenomenon, namely ``noise-expansion cascade'', that all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitude in initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level, and besides each of them might greatly change macro-level characteristic of turbulence. The ``noise-expansion cascade'' closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence and thus reveals the origin of randomness of turbulence. In addition, it clearly indicates that unavoidable thermal fluctuation must be considered for turbulence, even if it is several orders of magnitude smaller than other external environmental disturbances.</description>

      <title>A stable implementation of a data-driven scale-aware mesoscale parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean mesoscale eddies are often poorly represented in climate models, and therefore, their effects on the large scale circulation must be parameterized. Traditional parameterizations, which represent the bulk effect of the unresolved eddies, can be improved with new subgrid models learned directly from data. Zanna and Bolton 2020 (ZB20) applied an equation-discovery algorithm to reveal an interpretable expression parameterizing the subgrid momentum fluxes by mesoscale eddies through the components of the velocity-gradient tensor. In this work, we implement the ZB20 parameterization into the primitive-equation GFDL MOM6 ocean model and test it in two idealized configurations with significantly different dynamical regimes and topography. The original parameterization was found to generate excessive numerical noise near the grid scale. We propose two filtering approaches to avoid the numerical issues and additionally enhance the strength of large-scale energy backscatter. The filtered ZB20 parameterizations led to improved climatological mean state and energy distributions, compared to the current state-of-the-art energy backscatter parameterizations. The filtered ZB20 parameterizations are scale-aware and, consequently, can be used with a single value of the non-dimensional scaling coefficient for a range of resolutions. The successful application of the filtered ZB20 parameterizations to parameterize mesoscale eddies in two idealized configurations offers a promising opportunity to reduce long-standing biases in global ocean simulations in future studies.</description>
