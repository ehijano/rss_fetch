      <title>Katsura's self-similar groupoid actions, Putnam's binary factors, and their limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by Putnam to a pair of graph embeddings is identical to the shift map on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action on a graph. Moreover, performing a certain out-split on said graph gives rise to a Katsura groupoid action on the out-split graph whose associated limit space dynamical system is conjugate to the previous one. We characterise the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of their defining data, two matrices $A$, $B$. We prove a large class of the associated limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space, and the dynamics restricted to each circle is of the form $z\to z^{n}$. Moreover, we find a planar embedding of these spaces, thereby answering a question Putnam posed in his paper.</description>

      <title>Random attractors on countable state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the synchronization behavior of discrete-time Markov chains on countable state spaces. Representing a Markov chain in terms of a random dynamical system, which describes the collective dynamics of trajectories driven by the same noise, allows for the characterization of synchronization via random attractors.
  We establish the existence and uniqueness of a random attractor under mild conditions and show that forward and pullback attraction are equivalent in our setting. Additionally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for reaching the random attractor, or synchronization respectively, in a time of finite mean.
  By introducing insulated and synchronizing sets, we structure the state space with respect to the synchronization behavior and characterize the shape of the random attractor.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Periodic forces combined with feedback induce quenching in a bistable oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of an abnormal rhythm and a normal steady state is often observed in nature (e.g., epilepsy). Such a system is modeled as a bistable oscillator that possesses both a limit cycle and a fixed point. Although bistable oscillators under several perturbations have been addressed in the literature, the mechanism of oscillation quenching, a transition from a limit cycle to a fixed point, has not been fully understood. In this study, we analyze quenching using the extended Stuart-Landau oscillator driven by periodic forces. Numerical simulations suggest that the entrainment to the periodic force induces the amplitude change of a limit cycle. By reducing the system with an averaging method, we investigate the bifurcation structures of the periodically-driven oscillator. We find that oscillation quenching occurs by the homoclinic bifurcation when we use a periodic force combined with quadratic feedback. In conclusion, we develop a state-transition method in a bistable oscillator using periodic forces, which would have the potential for practical applications in controlling and annihilating abnormal oscillations. Moreover, we clarify the rich and diverse bifurcation structures behind periodically-driven bistable oscillators, which we believe would contribute to further understanding the complex behaviors in non-autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Iterative Learning Control of Fast, Nonlinear, Oscillatory Dynamics (Preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics (often called instabilities) is a known challenge in many fluid, plasma, and aerospace systems. These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met. The controller presented in this work provides a framework for low-speed control for a variety of fast, nonlinear systems that may aid in instability suppression and mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.11774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a proper, Gromov-hyperbolic metric space and a discrete, non-elementary, group of isometries, we define a natural subset of the limit set at infinity of the group called the ergodic limit set. The name is motivated by the fact that every ergodic measure which is invariant for the geodesic flow on the quotient metric space is concentrated on geodesics with endpoints belonging to the ergodic limit set. We refine the classical Bishop-Jones' Theorem proving that the packing dimension of the ergodic limit set coincides with the critical exponent of the group.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of quantitative instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01475v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a real algebraic group $G$ acting on a linear space $V$, a vector $v\in V$ is called unstable if $0\in \overline{Gv}-Gv$, where the closure is taken with respect to the Zariski topology. A fundamental theorem of Kempf in geometric invariant theory states that $v$ is unstable if and only if there is a one-parameter subgroup $A$ of $G$ such that $Av$ is unstable. Assuming $G$ is a semisimple real algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-group, we give a new proof to this result using a geometric interpretation of the setting. In the process, we also give a new proof of an effective version of this result by Shah and Yang. Our interpretation involves relating the length of vectors under a linear action to convex functions on certain $\cat$-spaces, and bound the later from below by Busemann functions.</description>

      <title>The Cobb-Douglas Production Function and the Old Bowley's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bowley's law, also referred to as the law of the constant wage share, was a noteworthy empirical finding in economics, suggesting that a nation's wage share tended to remain stable over time, as observed through most of the 20th century. The wage share represents the proportion of a country's economic output that is distributed to employees as compensation for their labor, usually in the form of wages. The term ''Bowley's law'' was coined in 1964 by Paul Samuelson, the first American laureate of the Nobel memorial prize in economic sciences. He attributed this principle to Sir Arthur Bowley, an English economist, mathematician, and statistician. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model derived from data for the American economy, originally employed by Cobb and Douglas in 1928 to validate the renowned Cobb-Douglas production function. We utilize symmetry methods, particularly those developed by Peter Olver, to elucidate the validity of Bowley's law within our model's framework. By employing these advanced mathematical techniques, our objective is to elucidate the factors contributing to the stability of the wage share over time. We demonstrate that the validity of both Bowley's law and the Cobb-Douglas production function arises from the robust growth of an economy, characterized by expansion in capital, labor, and production, which can be approximated by an exponential function. Through our analysis, we aim to offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that support Bowley's law and its implications for comprehending income distribution patterns in economies.</description>

      <title>An integral renewal equation approach to behavioural epidemic models with information index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an integral model describing an epidemic of an infectious disease. The model is behavioural in the sense that the constitutive law for the force of infection includes a distributed delay, called "information index", that describes the opinion-driven human behavioural changes. The information index, in turn, contains a memory kernel to mimic how the individuals maintain memory of the past values of the infection. We obtain sufficient conditions for the endemic equilibrium to be locally stable. In particular, we show that when the infectivity function is represented by an exponential distribution, stability is guaranteed by the weak Erlang memory kernel. However, through numerical simulations, we show that self-sustained oscillations may arise when the memory is more focused in the disease's past history, as exemplified by the strong Erlang kernel. We also show the model solutions in cases of different infectivity functions describing infectious diseases like influenza and SARS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field, and let $f:X\to{X}$ be a morphism defined over $K$. We formulate a number of statements of varying strengths asserting, roughly, that if there is at least one point $P_0\in{X(K)}$ whose $f$-orbit $\mathcal{O}_f(P_0):=\bigl\{f^n(P):n\in\mathbb{N}\bigr\}$ is Zariski dense, then there are many such points. For example, a weak conclusion would be that $X(K)$ is not the union of finitely many (grand) $f$-orbits, while a strong conclusion would be that any set of representatives for the Zariski dense grand $f$-orbits is Zariski dense. We prove statements of this sort for various classes of varieties and maps, including projective spaces, abelian varieties, and surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove analytic bounds on the equation of state of a cosmological fluid composed of an arbitrary number of canonical scalars evolving in a negative multi-exponential potential. Because of the negative energy, the universe is contracting and eventually undergoes a big crunch. A contracting universe is a fundamental feature of models of ekpyrosis and cyclic universes, which are a proposed alternative to cosmic inflation to solve the flatness and horizon problems. Our analytic bounds set quantitative constraints on general effective theories of ekpyrosis. When applied to specific top-down constructions, our bounds can be used to determine whether ekpyrosis could in principle be realized. We point out some possible sources of tension in realizing the ekpyrotic universe in controlled constructions of string theory.</description>
