      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Inference for Regression-Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) are often estimated using local regression methods. However, global approximation methods are generally deemed inefficient. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric framework tailored for estimating treatment effects in RDDs. Our global approach conceptualizes the identification of treatment effects within RDDs as a partially linear modeling problem, with the linear component capturing the treatment effect. Furthermore, we utilize the P-spline method to approximate the nonparametric function and develop procedures for inferring treatment effects within this framework. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed method performs well across various scenarios. Furthermore, we illustrate using real-world datasets that our global approach may result in more reliable inference.</description>

      <title>Estimating Causal Effects of Discrete and Continuous Treatments with Binary Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an instrumental variable framework for identifying and estimating average and quantile effects of discrete and continuous treatments with binary instruments. The basis of our approach is a local copula representation of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes and unobservables determining treatment assignment. This representation allows us to introduce an identifying assumption, so-called copula invariance, that restricts the local dependence of the copula with respect to the treatment propensity. We show that copula invariance identifies treatment effects for the entire population and other subpopulations such as the treated. The identification results are constructive and lead to straightforward semiparametric estimation procedures based on distribution regression. An application to the effect of sleep on well-being uncovers interesting patterns of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Locally Regular and Efficient Tests in Non-Regular Semiparametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers hypothesis testing in semiparametric models which may be non-regular. I show that C($\alpha$) style tests are locally regular under mild conditions, including in cases where locally regular estimators do not exist, such as models which are (semi-parametrically) weakly identified. I characterise the appropriate limit experiment in which to study local (asymptotic) optimality of tests in the non-regular case, permitting the generalisation of classical power bounds to this case. I give conditions under which these power bounds are attained by the proposed C($\alpha$) style tests. The application of the theory to a single index model and an instrumental variables model is worked out in detail.</description>

      <title>Estimating Factor-Based Spot Volatility Matrices with Noisy and Asynchronous High-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator of high-dimensional spot volatility matrices satisfying a low-rank plus sparse structure from noisy and asynchronous high-frequency data collected for an ultra-large number of assets. The noise processes are allowed to be temporally correlated, heteroskedastic, asymptotically vanishing and dependent on the efficient prices. We define a kernel-weighted pre-averaging method to jointly tackle the microstructure noise and asynchronicity issues, and we obtain uniformly consistent estimates for latent prices. We impose a continuous-time factor model with time-varying factor loadings on the price processes, and estimate the common factors and loadings via a local principal component analysis. Assuming a uniform sparsity condition on the idiosyncratic volatility structure, we combine the POET and kernel-smoothing techniques to estimate the spot volatility matrices for both the latent prices and idiosyncratic errors. Under some mild restrictions, the estimated spot volatility matrices are shown to be uniformly consistent under various matrix norms. We provide Monte-Carlo simulation and empirical studies to examine the numerical performance of the developed estimation methodology.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Tuning Parameter Selection for High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lasso-type estimators are routinely used to estimate high-dimensional time series models. The theoretical guarantees established for Lasso typically require the penalty level to be chosen in a suitable fashion often depending on unknown population quantities. Furthermore, the resulting estimates and the number of variables retained in the model depend crucially on the chosen penalty level. However, there is currently no theoretically founded guidance for this choice in the context of high-dimensional time series. Instead one resorts to selecting the penalty level in an ad hoc manner using, e.g., information criteria or cross-validation. We resolve this problem by considering estimation of the perhaps most commonly employed multivariate time series model, the linear vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and propose a weighted Lasso estimator with penalization chosen in a fully data-driven way. The theoretical guarantees that we establish for the resulting estimation and prediction error match those currently available for methods based on infeasible choices of penalization. We thus provide a first solution for choosing the penalization in high-dimensional time series models.</description>

      <title>Partially identified heteroskedastic SVARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVARs) exploiting a break in the variances of the structural shocks. Point-identification for this class of models relies on an eigen-decomposition involving the covariance matrices of reduced-form errors and requires that all the eigenvalues are distinct. This point-identification, however, fails in the presence of multiplicity of eigenvalues. This occurs in an empirically relevant scenario where, for instance, only a subset of structural shocks had the break in their variances, or where a group of variables shows a variance shift of the same amount. Together with zero or sign restrictions on the structural parameters and impulse responses, we derive the identified sets for impulse responses and show how to compute them. We perform inference on the impulse response functions, building on the robust Bayesian approach developed for set identified SVARs. To illustrate our proposal, we present an empirical example based on the literature on the global crude oil market where the identification is expected to fail due to multiplicity of eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: Forecast combination -- the aggregation of individual forecasts from multiple experts or models -- is a proven approach to economic forecasting. To date, research on economic forecasting has concentrated on local combination methods, which handle separate but related forecasting tasks in isolation. Yet, it has been known for over two decades in the machine learning community that global methods, which exploit task-relatedness, can improve on local methods that ignore it. Motivated by the possibility for improvement, this paper introduces a framework for globally combining forecasts while being flexible to the level of task-relatedness. Through our framework, we develop global versions of several existing forecast combinations. To evaluate the efficacy of these new global forecast combinations, we conduct extensive comparisons using synthetic and real data. Our real data comparisons, which involve forecasts of core economic indicators in the Eurozone, provide empirical evidence that the accuracy of global combinations of economic forecasts can surpass local combinations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Panel Data Discrete Choice Models with Lagged Dependent Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the identification and estimation of a class of semiparametric (distribution-free) panel data binary choice models with lagged dependent variables, exogenous covariates, and entity fixed effects. We provide a novel identification strategy, using an "identification at infinity" argument. In contrast with the celebrated Honore and Kyriazidou (2000), our method permits time trends of any form and does not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality". We propose an easily implementable conditional maximum score estimator. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are fully characterized. A small-scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that our approach performs satisfactorily in finite samples. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by presenting an empirical application to enrollment in private hospital insurance using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data.</description>

      <title>Testing for Peer Effects without Specifying the Network Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Anderson-Rubin (AR) test for the presence of peer effects in panel data without the need to specify the network structure. The unrestricted model of our test is a linear panel data model of social interactions with dyad-specific peer effects. The proposed AR test evaluates if the peer effect coefficients are all zero. As the number of peer effect coefficients increases with the sample size, so does the number of instrumental variables (IVs) employed to test the restrictions under the null, rendering Bekker's many-IV environment. By extending existing many-IV asymptotic results to panel data, we establish the asymptotic validity of the proposed AR test. Our Monte Carlo simulations show the robustness and superior performance of the proposed test compared to some existing tests with misspecified networks. We provide two applications to demonstrate its empirical relevance.</description>

      <title>On the Inconsistency of Cluster-Robust Inference and How Subsampling Can Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional methods of cluster-robust inference are inconsistent in the presence of unignorably large clusters. We formalize this claim by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of the conventional methods. We find that this condition for the consistency is rejected for a majority of empirical research papers. In this light, we propose a novel score subsampling method that achieves uniform size control over a broad class of data generating processes, covering that fails the conventional method. Simulation studies support these claims. With real data used by an empirical paper, we showcase that the conventional methods conclude significance while our proposed method concludes insignificance.</description>

      <title>Nested Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression: Long Term, Mediated, and Time Varying Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several causal parameters in short panel data models are scalar summaries of a function called a nested nonparametric instrumental variable regression (nested NPIV). Examples include long term, mediated, and time varying treatment effects identified using proxy variables. However, it appears that no prior estimators or guarantees for nested NPIV exist, preventing flexible estimation and inference for these causal parameters. A major challenge is compounding ill posedness due to the nested inverse problems. We analyze adversarial estimators of nested NPIV, and provide sufficient conditions for efficient inference on the causal parameter. Our nonasymptotic analysis has three salient features: (i) introducing techniques that limit how ill posedness compounds; (ii) accommodating neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces; and (iii) extending to causal functions, e.g. long term heterogeneous treatment effects. We measure long term heterogeneous treatment effects of Project STAR and mediated proximal treatment effects of the Job Corps.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Non-Parametric Sequential Tests and Confidence Sequences with Possibly Dependent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential tests and their implied confidence sequences, which are valid at arbitrary stopping times, promise flexible statistical inference and on-the-fly decision making. However, strong guarantees are limited to parametric sequential tests that under-cover in practice or concentration-bound-based sequences that over-cover and have suboptimal rejection times. In this work, we consider classic delayed-start normal-mixture sequential probability ratio tests, and we provide the first asymptotic type-I-error and expected-rejection-time guarantees under general non-parametric data generating processes, where the asymptotics are indexed by the test's burn-in time. The type-I-error results primarily leverage a martingale strong invariance principle and establish that these tests (and their implied confidence sequences) have type-I error rates asymptotically equivalent to the desired (possibly varying) $\alpha$-level. The expected-rejection-time results primarily leverage an identity inspired by It\^o's lemma and imply that, in certain asymptotic regimes, the expected rejection time is asymptotically equivalent to the minimum possible among $\alpha$-level tests. We show how to apply our results to sequential inference on parameters defined by estimating equations, such as average treatment effects. Together, our results establish these (ostensibly parametric) tests as general-purpose, non-parametric, and near-optimal. We illustrate this via numerical simulations and a real-data application to A/B testing at Netflix.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Grouped Time-Varying Network Vector Autoregression Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a flexible time-varying network vector autoregressive model framework for large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and node-specific time-varying momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown time-varying coefficients to be estimated can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative clustering algorithm with nonparametrically estimated distance matrix is combined with a ratio criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and membership. A post-grouping local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific time-varying momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the preliminary estimates which ignore the latent structure. We further modify the methodology and theory to allow for structural breaks in either the group membership, group number or group-specific coefficient functions. Numerical studies including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application are presented to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Optimal Multi-Armed Gaussian Best Arm Identification with a Fixed Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the experimental design problem for identifying the arm with the highest expected outcome, referred to as best arm identification (BAI). In our experiments, the number of treatment-allocation rounds is fixed. During each round, a decision-maker allocates an arm and observes a corresponding outcome, which follows a Gaussian distribution with variances that can differ among the arms. At the end of the experiment, the decision-maker recommends one of the arms as an estimate of the best arm. To design an experiment, we first discuss lower bounds for the probability of misidentification. Our analysis highlights that the available information on the outcome distribution, such as means (expected outcomes), variances, and the choice of the best arm, significantly influences the lower bounds. Because available information is limited in actual experiments, we develop a lower bound that is valid under the unknown means and the unknown choice of the best arm, which are referred to as the worst-case lower bound. We demonstrate that the worst-case lower bound depends solely on the variances of the outcomes. Then, under the assumption that the variances are known, we propose the Generalized-Neyman-Allocation (GNA)-empirical-best-arm (EBA) strategy, an extension of the Neyman allocation proposed by Neyman (1934). We show that the GNA-EBA strategy is asymptotically optimal in the sense that its probability of misidentification aligns with the lower bounds as the sample size increases infinitely and the differences between the expected outcomes of the best and other suboptimal arms converge to the same values across arms. We refer to such strategies as asymptotically worst-case optimal.</description>
