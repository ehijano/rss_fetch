      <title>A Comparison of Micromegas with x/y Strip Charge Readouts for Directional Recoil Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the topology and direction of low-energy nuclear and electronic recoils is broadly desirable in nuclear and particle physics, with applications in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), astrophysical neutrino measurements, probing dark matter (DM) beneath the neutrino fog, and confirming the galactic origin of DM. Gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer the required gain and readout granularity, but must be large to achieve the required volume. Therefore, scalable, cost-effective TPC readout technologies are essential. High-resolution $x/y$ strip readouts, previously identified as the optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance, are examined here. To guide the readout design of a 40-L detector under construction, we present a comparative analysis of nine $x/y$ strip configurations with Micromegas amplification. Each setup employs VMM3a ASIC within the RD51 Scalable Readout System (SRS) for strip readout and a pulse height analyzer for reading out the Micromegas mesh. These complementary techniques assess gain, gain resolution, $x/y$ charge sharing, and point resolution of each setup. Configurations with a diamond-like carbon (DLC) layer exhibit improved spark resistance, allowing larger maximal gain and improved fractional gain resolution without notable impact on the point resolution. Although the DLC reduces charge fraction on lower strips, this can be mitigated by narrowing the upper strips. Our results allow us to select the optimal readout for future detectors. We also observe clear 3D tracks from alpha particles, with performance in good agreement with a simple simulation. Overall, Micromegas with $x/y$ strip readout are promising for low-energy recoil observatories. However, dedicated amplification devices and/or improved electronics are needed to reach the fundamental performance limit of 3D electron counting.</description>

      <title>Fully upgraded $\beta$-NMR setup at ISOLDE for high-precision high-field studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-NMR is an advancing technique that enables measurements relevant to various fields of research, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. Among the recent achievements of the $\beta$-NMR setup located at the ISOLDE facility at CERN is the determination of the magnetic moment of a shortlived nucleus with a part-per-million accuracy. Presented here are major upgrades and extensions of that $\beta$-NMR setup. The most important advancement is the installation of a 4.7 T superconducting solenoidal magnet, leading to sub-ppm spatial homogeneity and temporal stability of the magnetic field. A detector array optimised for such magnetic field has also been implemented and a more powerful, time-resolved, fully-digital data acquisition system has been deployed. To commission the upgraded beamline, $\beta$-NMR resonances of short-lived 26Na were recorded in solid and liquid samples. These showed 3-fold narrower linewidths and 15-fold higher resolving power than using the previous setup. Hence, the improvements achieved here permit more accurate bio-$\beta$-NMR studies, investigating, e.g., the interaction of metal ions with biomolecules, such as DNA. They also pave the way for the first studies of the distribution of the magnetisation inside short-lived nuclei.</description>

      <title>The CuboDAQ Data Acquisition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuboDAQ is a custom data acquisition system to read out SiPM-based detectors. It features electronic boards to digitize the SiPMs signal, an FPGA-based system-on-module board, the connectivity to transmit the data to a central server, and all the software necessary to operate them. The front-end is based on the TOFPET2 ASIC, produced by PETsys, connected to a custom board, featuring an Enclustra Mercury SA1 module with a Cyclone~V FPGA. Multiple boards can be operated synchronously by distributing the clock and synchronous reset signals from a central source. The system features a complete software framework to calibrate and monitor the detectors, to acquire and process data and to perform track reconstruction. The CuboDAQ system performance has been evaluated in different scenarios and can cope with sustained rates of above $4\cdot 10^6$ hits/s, with peaks of more than $7\cdot 10^6$ hits/s. This system has been employed for the readout of the SND@LHC detector at CERN, a testbeam telescope and lab setups.</description>

      <title>Criteria for identifying and evaluating locations that could potentially host the Cosmic Explorer observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatory that is being designed in the 2020s and is envisioned to begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope in Europe. The CE concept currently consists of two widely separated L-shaped observatories in the United States, one with 40 km-long arms and the other with 20 km-long arms. This order of magnitude increase in scale with respect to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observatories will, together with technological improvements, deliver an order of magnitude greater astronomical reach, allowing access to gravitational waves from remnants of the first stars and opening a wide discovery aperture to the novel and unknown. In addition to pushing the reach of gravitational-wave astronomy, CE endeavors to approach the lifecycle of large scientific facilities in a way that prioritizes mutually beneficial relationships with local and Indigenous communities. This article describes the (scientific, cost and access, and social) criteria that will be used to identify and evaluate locations that could potentially host the CE observatories.</description>

      <title>Radiation Measurements Using Timepix3 with Silicon Sensor and Bare Chip in Proton Beams for FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the response of Timepix3 semiconductor pixel detectors in proton beams of varying intensities, with a focus on FLASH proton therapy. Using the Timepix3 ASIC chip, we measured the spatial and spectral characteristics of 220 MeV proton beams delivered in short pulses. The experimental setup involved Minipix readout electronics integrated with a Timepix3 chipboard in a flexible architecture, and an Advapix Timepix3 with a silicon sensor. Measurements were carried out with Timepix3 detectors equipped with GaAs and silicon Si sensors. We also investigated the response of a bare Timepix3 ASIC chip (without a sensor). The detectors were placed within a waterproof holder attached to the IBA Blue water phantom, with additional measurements performed in air behind a 2 cm-thick solid phantom. The results demonstrated the capability of the Timepix3 detectors to measure time-over-threshold (ToT) and count rate (number of events) in both conventional and ultra-high-dose-rates proton beams. The bare ASIC chip configuration sustained up to a dose rate (DR) of 270 Gy/s, although it exhibited limited spatial resolution due to low detection efficiency. In contrast, Minipix Timepix3 with experimental GaAs sensors showed saturation at low DR=5 Gy/s. Furthermore, the Advapix Timepix3 detector was used in standard and customized configurations. In the standard configuration (Ikrum =5), the detector showed saturation at DR=5 Gy/s. But, in the customized configuration when the per-pixel discharging signal (Ikrum) was increased to 80, the detector demonstrated enhanced performance by reducing the duration of the ToT signal, allowing beam spot imaging up to DR=28 Gy/s in the plateau region of the Bragg curve. For such DR, the frame acquisition time was reduced to the order of microseconds, meaning only a fraction of the pulse (with pulse lengths on the order of milliseconds) was captured.</description>

      <title>Model-independent searches of new physics in DARWIN with a semi-supervised deep learning pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning pipeline to perform a model-independent, likelihood-free search for anomalous (i.e., non-background) events in the proposed next generation multi-ton scale liquid Xenon-based direct detection experiment, DARWIN. We train an anomaly detector comprising a variational autoencoder and a classifier on extensive, high-dimensional simulated detector response data and construct a one-dimensional anomaly score optimised to reject the background only hypothesis in the presence of an excess of non-background-like events. We benchmark the procedure with a sensitivity study that determines its power to reject the background-only hypothesis in the presence of an injected WIMP dark matter signal, outperforming the classical, likelihood-based background rejection test. We show that our neural networks learn relevant energy features of the events from low-level, high-dimensional detector outputs, without the need to compress this data into lower-dimensional observables, thus reducing computational effort and information loss. For the future, our approach lays the foundation for an efficient end-to-end pipeline that eliminates the need for many of the corrections and cuts that are traditionally part of the analysis chain, with the potential of achieving higher accuracy and significant reduction of analysis time.</description>

      <title>Fast timing silicon R$\&amp;$D for the future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will utilize high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($e+A$) collisions to solve several fundamental questions including searching for gluon saturation and studying the proton/nuclear structure. Complementary to the ongoing EIC project detector technical prototype carried out by the ePIC collaboration, a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (i.e., MALTA2) based fast timing silicon tracking detector (FMT) has been proposed to provide additional hits for track reconstruction in the forward and backward region at the EIC to improve the overall track reconstruction quality. The fast timing resolution of the MALTA2 technology will help reject background events at the EIC as well. Progress of latest MALTA2 R$\&amp;$D, the development of a new MALTA2 quad-sensor prototype module and impacts of the proposed FMT in EIC physics studies will be discussed.</description>

      <title>High Energy Particle Detection with Large Area Superconducting Microwire Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of an 8-channel $2\times2$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV proton beam and 8 GeV electron and pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The SMSPD detection efficiency was measured for the first time for protons, electrons, and pions, enabled by the use of a silicon tracking telescope that provided precise spatial resolution of 30 $\mu$m for 120 GeV protons and 130 $\mu$m for 8 GeV electrons and pions. The result demonstrated consistent detection efficiency across pixels and at different bias currents. Time resolution of 1.15 ns was measured for the first time for SMSPD with proton, electron, and pions, enabled by the use of an MCP-PMT which provided a ps-level reference time stamp. The results presented is the first step towards developing SMSPD array systems optimized for high energy particle detection and identification for future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE's solar neutrino capabilities with neutral-current detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) has the potential to make a precise measurement of the total active flux of 8B solar neutrinos via neutral-current (NC) interactions with argon. This would complement proposed precise measurements of solar-neutrino fluxes in DUNE via charged-current (CC) interactions with argon and mixed CC/NC interactions with electrons. Together, these would enable DUNE to make a SNO-like comparison of rates and thus to make the most precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ using solar neutrinos. Realizing this potential requires dedicated but realistic efforts to improve DUNE's low-energy capabilities and separately to reduce neutrino-argon cross section uncertainties. Comparison of mixing-parameter results obtained using solar neutrinos in DUNE and reactor antineutrinos in JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) would allow unprecedented tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>Remote Reactor Ranging via Antineutrino Oscillations</title>

Abstract: Antineutrinos from nuclear reactors have the potential to be used for reactor monitoring in the mid- to far-field under certain conditions. Antineutrinos are an unshieldable signal and carry information about the reactor core and the distance they travel. Using gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detectors for this purpose has been previously proposed alongside rate-only analyses. As antineutrinos carry information about their distance of travel in their energy spectrum, the analyses can be extended to a spectral analysis to gain more knowledge about the detected core. Two complementary analyses are used to evaluate the distance between a proposed gadolinium-doped water-based liquid scintillator detector and a detected nuclear reactor. Example cases are shown for a detector in Boulby Mine, near the Boulby Underground Laboratory in the UK, and six reactor sites in the UK and France. The analyses both show strong potential to range reactors, but are limited by the detector design.</description>

      <title>Spin-Energy Entanglement of a Time-Focused Neutron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>
