      <title>Leveraging Reactant Entanglement in the Coherent Control of Ultracold Bimolecular Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a crucial resource for achieving quantum advantages in quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. As shown in this Letter, entanglement is also a valuable resource for the coherent control of the large class of bimolecular chemical reactions. We introduce an entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme, in which the initial preparation of the superposition state is divided into two steps: the first entangles the reactants, and the second is responsible for coherent control. This approach can overcome the limitations of traditional coherent control of scattering caused by non-interfering pathways, known as satellite terms. By tuning the amount of entanglement between reactants, the visibility of coherent control in chemical reactions can be modulated and optimized. Significantly, there exists an optimal amount of entanglement, which ensures complete indistinguishability of the reaction pathways, maximizing the extent of control. This entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme is computationally illustrated using the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction, where a perfect control over the parity of the product rotational states is achieved.</description>

      <title>Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and two-band density-matrix equations within the tight-binding approximation. The simulation results from the two methods are qualitatively consistent. We focus on the fishbone structure near the energy gap at the $\textrm{M}$ point, which exhibits a temporal period equal to that of the pump laser. To gain deeper insight into this structure, we simplify the two-band model to a single-electron model located at the $\textsc{M}$ point, allowing us to derive an analytical expression that can qualitatively reproduce the numerical results. Our analytical results reveal that both the interband transition dipole moments (TDMs) and the Berry connection play important roles in the fishbone structure of the ATAS. To isolate the effect of the interband TDMs, we set the Berry connection to zero, and the corresponding results reveal that the Berry connection suppresses the intensity of the absorption spectrum. Our study may shed light on the generation mechanism of the fishbone structure of the ATAS in hBN.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: A Time-Domain Generalization of Extended Koopmans' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem within the framework of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. This formulation naturally yields well-defined time-dependent hole states formed by removing one electron from the multielectron system, enabling the instantaneous construction of reduced density matrices for the photofragments during MCTDHF simulations with negligible computational overhead. Leveraging this foundation, we derive the equation of motion for the time-dependent Dyson orbitals and develop a systematic approach to extract hole-resolved observables directly from the time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions. The proposed method is universally applicable to both projection-based and flux-based schemes, offering a powerful tool for disentangling correlated electron-hole dynamics in ultrafast multichannel ionization processes.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: Applications in Photoionization of Water Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By simulating the real-time multielectron wavefunction with the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) approach, we conduct an \textit{ab initio} study of the single-photon ionization process of a body-fixed water molecule ($\mathrm{H_2O}$) driven by attosecond pulses. To this end, we present a full-dimensional implementation of the MCTDHF method based on one-center expansions, allowing for the simulation of arbitrarily polarized lasers and multi-center polyatomic potentials. With a rigorous definition of the time-dependent hole state (TDHS) using the time-domain generalization of extended Koopmans' theorem (TD-EKT), we derive the reduced ion density matrix within the MCTDHF framework, which inherently encodes the total and channel-resolved photoionization cross sections of $\mathrm{H_2O}$. The cross sections obtained are benchmarked against existing experimental and theoretical results, validating the TDHS formalism. Furthermore, by adjusting the phase delay and intensity ratio of a pair of orthogonally polarized attosecond pulses, we explore the ultrafast control of attosecond coherence between electronic states of $\mathrm{H_2O^+}$.</description>

      <title>New generation of cavity microscope for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with atomic qubit arrays: confronting the cost of connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>

      <title>The fate of the Fermi surface coupled to a single-wave-vector cavity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field of standing-wave or ring cavities induces a spatially modulated, infinite-range interaction between atoms in an ultracold Fermi gas, with a single wavelength comparable to the Fermi length. This interaction has no analog in other systems of itinerant particles and has so far been studied only in the regime where it is attractive at zero distance. Here, we fully solve the problem of competing instabilities of the Fermi surface induced by single-wavelength interactions. We find that while the density-wave (superradiant) instability dominates on the attractive side, it is absent for repulsive interactions, where the competition is instead won by non-superradiant superfluid phases at low temperatures, with Fermion pairs forming at both vanishing and finite center-of-mass momentum. Moreover, even in the absence of such symmetry-breaking instabilities, we find the Fermi surface to be always nontrivially deformed from an isotropic shape. We estimate this full phenomenology to be within reach of dedicated state-of-the-art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <title>Projectile excitation to the $\mathbf{2s2p}$ $\mathbf{^{3}\!P}$ and $\mathbf{^{1}\!P}$ autoionizing states in swift collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state $\mathbf{(1s^2, 1s2s\,^{3,1}S)}$ ion beams with helium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of the projectile $2s2p\,^{3}\!P$ and $2s2p\,^{1}\!P$ autoionizing states is investigated in 0.5-1.5 MeV/u collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state three-component $(1s^2,1s2s\,^{3}\!S,1s2s\,^{1}\!S)$ ion beams with helium targets. The mixed-state beams are produced in the stripping systems of the 5.5~MV Demokritos tandem accelerator. Using high-resolution Auger projectile electron spectroscopy, the normalized Auger electron yields are measured at $0^\circ$ relative to the beam direction. In addition, a three-electron atomic orbital close-coupling approach, employing full configuration interaction and antisymmetrization of the three-electron, two-center total wave function, is applied to calculate the production cross sections for these states from each of the three initial ion beam components. Thereupon, the theoretical Auger yields are computed and found to be smaller than experiment by factors ranging from about 1.2 to 7.6. Agreement, however, improves when larger $1s2s\,^{1}\!S$ fractions, not only based on spin statistics, are projected. Overall, this non-perturbative treatment of excitation, which does not rely on scaling parameters or renormalization, marks a significant advancement in the modeling of multielectron, multi-open-shell quantum systems subjected to ultrafast perturbations, where current understanding remains incomplete.</description>

      <title>Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>
