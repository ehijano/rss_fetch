      <title>Markovian families for pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the classification approach described for transitive Anosov flows in dimension 3 in a previous preprint of the author, in this paper we describe a method for classifying (not necessarily transitive) pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds up to orbital equivalence. To every pseudo-Anosov flow $\Phi$ (with no 1-prongs) on $M^3$ is associated a bifoliated plane $\mathcal{P}$ endowed with an action of $\pi_1(M)$. It is known that the previous action characterizes $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence and admits infinitely many Markovian families (i.e. collections of rectangles in $\mathcal{P}$ generalizing the notion of Markov partition for group actions on the plane). Our goal in this paper consists in showing that :
  1) if $\mathcal{R}$ is a Markovian family of $\Phi$, the number of orbits of rectangles of $\mathcal{R}$ and their pattern of intersection can be encoded by a finite combinatorial object, called a geometric type, which describes completely $\Phi$ up to Dehn-Goodman-Fried surgeries on a specific finite set $\Gamma$ of periodic orbits of $\Phi$
  2) our previous choices of surgeries on $\Gamma$ can be read as sequences of rectangles in $\mathcal{R}$ and can be encoded by finite combinatorial objects, called cycles
  3) a geometric type with cycles of $\mathcal{R}$ describes the original flow $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence
  Several of the above results will be stated and proven in a slightly more general setting involving strong Markovian actions on the plane. Finally, due to the lack of bibliographic references on pseudo-Anosov flows in dimension 3, in the first part of the paper we provide an introduction to pseudo-Anosov flow theory containing several useful results for our classification approach together with their proofs.</description>

      <title>Computing Resilience Measures in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience broadly describes a quality of withstanding perturbations. Measures of system resilience have gathered increasing attention across applied disciplines, yet existing metrics often lack computational accessibility and generalizability. In this work, we review the literature on resilience measures through the lens of dynamical systems theory and numerical methods. In this context, we reformulate pertinent measures into a general form and introduce a resource-efficient algorithm designed for their parallel numerical estimation. By coupling these measures with a global continuation of attractors, we enable their consistent evaluation along system parameter changes. The resulting framework is modular and easily extendable, allowing for the incorporation of new resilience measures as they arise. We demonstrate the framework on a range of illustrative dynamical systems, revealing key differences in how resilience changes across systems. This approach provides a more global perspective compared to traditional linear stability metrics used in local bifurcation analysis, which can overlook inconspicuous but significant shifts in system resilience. This work opens the door to genuinely novel lines of inquiry, such as the development of new early warning signals for critical transitions or the discovery of universal scaling behaviours. All code and computational tools are provided as an open-source contribution to the DynamicalSystems.jl software library.</description>

      <title>Euler Poincare Dynamics and Control on Lie Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Euler Poincare dynamics on Lie groupoids with a focus on optimal control. Extending the classical Lie group formulation, we derive reduced equations on trivial Lie groupoids and interpret the result as a generalized rigid body on the sphere. This model couples internal rotational dynamics with translational motion on the Sphere. We illustrate the framework with an example from collective cell migration, showing how groupoid-based dynamics capture the trade-off between energy and migration time. The results demonstrate how Lie groupoid methods broaden the applicability of geometric control beyond standard rigid body systems</description>

      <title>Radiating Solitary Waves in an FPUT Lattice with Random Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of solitary waves in a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice with small random heterogeneity in the linear spring force. Perturbed by the random environment, solitary waves lose energy through a radiative tail, resulting in gradual amplitude attenuation. As long as the wave remains coherent, we track its position and amplitude via a modulation approach. An expansion of the resulting modulation equations provides explicit predictions for the slow average amplitude decay, which we verify through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Convex iso-Delaunay regions in strata of translation surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strata of translation surfaces are covered by the closures of finitely many iso-Delaunay regions: open subspaces parametrizing surfaces whose Delaunay triangulations are combinatorially equivalent. We prove that the iso-Delaunay regions for triangulations with involutions called triangle matchings are convex with respect to the angle coordinates of the triangles. As a corollary, we show that all iso-Delaunay regions in hyperelliptic stratum components are convex. This work generalizes two directions in the theory of flat surfaces.</description>

      <title>Inexact and Stochastic Gradient Optimization Algorithms with Inertia and Hessian Driven Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a real Hilbert space setting, we study the convergence properties of an inexact gradient algorithm featuring both viscous and Hessian driven damping for convex differentiable optimization. In this algorithm, the gradient evaluation can be subject to deterministic and stochastic perturbations. In the deterministic case, we show that under appropriate summability assumptions on the perturbation, our algorithm enjoys fast convergence of the objective values, of the gradients and weak convergence of the iterates toward a minimizer of the objective. In the stochastic case, assuming the perturbation is zero-mean, we can weaken our summability assumptions on the error variance and provide fast convergence of the values both in expectation and almost surely. We also improve the convergence rates from $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ to $o(\cdot)$ in almost sure sense. We also prove almost sure summability property of the gradients, which implies the almost sure fast convergence of the gradients towards zero. We will highlight the trade-off between fast convergence and the applicable regime on the sequence of errors in the gradient computations. We finally report some numerical results to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory: A Framework for Adaptive Control in Non-Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex landscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability to learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that integrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach dynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode key topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to automatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization strategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented potential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence characteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical framework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging non-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to experience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics), enhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring specialized domain knowledge or extensive offline training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $u(x)$ be a subpolynomial function in a Hardy field. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted uniform distribution of the sequences $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(u(p_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime. This extends the main result of [4] to the weighted setting and leads to new applications in uniform distribution theory, ergodic theory, and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a universal framework for analyzing coupled random matrix models, centered around the newly defined Dyson Trace Flow and the Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law. We derive stochastic differential equations for eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling, establish well-posedness, and prove a large deviation principle with explicit rate functions. The theory is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing phenomena such as exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries is established, connecting to quantum chaos. These results generalize classical random matrix theory to interacting systems, with applications in neural networks and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>How deep is your network? Deep vs. shallow learning of transfer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>On Robustness of Consensus over Pseudo-Undirected Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or directed communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in information exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states, while directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root nodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on achievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network topologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional connectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to differ, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions. The resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus under connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the system to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull of the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights for a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous interception of a moving target.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms, ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Solving the cohomological equation for locally hamiltonian flows, part II -- global obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing the research initiated in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, we study the existence of solutions and their regularity for the cohomological equations $X u=f$ for locally Hamiltonian flows (determined by the vector field $X$) on a compact surface $M$ of genus $g\geq 1$. We move beyond the case studied so far by Forni in \cite{Fo1,Fo3}, when the flow is minimal over the entire surface and the function $f$ satisfies some Sobolev regularity conditions. We deal with the flow restricted to any its minimal component and any smooth function $f$ whenever the flow satisfies the Full Filtration Diophantine Condition (FFDC) (this is a full measure condition). The main goal of this article is to quantify optimal regularity of solutions. For this purpose we construct a family of invariant distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$, $\bar{t}\in\mathscr{TF}^*$ that play the roles of the Forni's invariant distributions introduced in \cite{Fo1,Fo3} by using the language of translation surfaces. The distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$ are global in nature (as emphasized in the title of the article), unlike the distributions $\mathfrak{d}^k_{\sigma,j}$, $(\sigma,k,j)\in\mathscr{TD}$ and $\mathfrak{C}^k_{\sigma,l}$, $(\sigma,k,l)\in\mathscr{TC}$ introduced in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, which are defined locally. All three families are used to determine the optimal regularity of the solutions for the cohomological equation, see Theorem 1.1 and 1.2. As a by-product, we also obtained, interesting in itself, a spectral result (Theorem 1.3) for the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle acting on functional spaces arising naturally at the transition to the first-return map.</description>

      <title>Hopf orbits and the first ECH capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamically convex star-shaped domains in a symplectic vector space of dimension $4$. For such a domain, a ``Hopf orbit'' is a closed characteristic in the boundary which is unknotted and has self-linking number $-1$. We show that the minimum action among Hopf orbits exists and defines a symplectic capacity for dynamically convex star-shaped domains. We further show that this capacity agrees with the first ECH capacity for such domains. Combined with a result of Edtmair, this implies that for dynamically convex star-shaped domains in four dimensions, the first ECH capacity agrees with the cylinder capacity. This also provides a method to show that the first ECH capacity of a dynamically convex star-shaped domain satisfies the axioms of a normalized symplectic capacity without any need for Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ denote the $n^{\rm th}$ Gleason polynomial, whose roots correspond to parameters $c$ such that the critical point $0$ is periodic of exact period $n$ under iteration of $z^2 + c$, and let $\bar{G}_n$ denote the reduction of $G_n$ modulo $2$. Buff, Floyd, Koch, and Parry made the surprising observation that the number of real roots of $G_n$ is equal to the number of irreducible factors of $\bar{G}_n$ for all $n$. We provide a bijective proof for this result by first providing explicit bijections between (a) the set of real roots of $G_n$ and the set $\bar{N}(n)$ of equivalence classes of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ under the inversion map swapping $0$ and $1$; and (b) the set of irreducible factors of $G_n$ modulo 2 and the set $\tilde{N}^+(n)$ of binary necklaces which are either primitive of length $n$ with an even number of $1$'s or primitive of length $n/2$ with an odd number of $1$'s. We then provide an explicit bijection, closely related to Milnor and Thurston's kneading theory, between $\bar{N}(n)$ and $\tilde{N}^+(n)$. In addition, we provide explicit bijections between $\bar{N}(n)$, the set ${\rm CUP}(n)$ of cyclic unimodal permutations of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$, and the set $N^-(n)$ of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ with an odd number of $1$'s.</description>

Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>
