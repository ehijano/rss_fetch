      <title>Intermittent flow paths in biofilms grown in a microfluidic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofilms exposed to flow experience shear stress, which leads to a competitive interaction between the growth and development of a biofilm and shearing. In this study, Pseudonomas fluorescene biofilm was grown in a microfluidic channel and exposed to forced flow of an aqueous solution of variable velocity. It can be observed that under certain conditions preferential flow paths form with a dynamic, but quasi-steady state interaction of growth, detachment, and re-attachment. We find that the regimes for preferential flow path development are determined by nutrient availability and the ratio of shear stress versus the biofilm's ability to resist shear forces. The intermittent regime of flow paths is mainly driven by the supply with nutrients, which we confirm by comparison with a numerical model based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics and Lattice Boltzmann hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Entropy Stable Collocation High-Order DG Methods for Compressible Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order methods are well-suited for the numerical simulation of complex compressible turbulent flows, but require additional stabilization techniques to capture instabilities arising from the underlying non-linear hyperbolic equations. This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods for the stabilization of compressible (wall-bounded) turbulent flows. For this investigation, an entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method is applied on Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto nodes. In the compressible regime, an additional stabilization technique for shock capturing based on a convex blending of a low-order finite volume with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin operator is utilized. The present investigation provides a systematic study from convergence tests, to the Taylor-Green vortex and finally to a more intricate turbulent wall-bounded 3D diffuser flow, encompassing both weakly compressible and compressible regimes. The comparison demonstrates that the DGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto nodes is less accurate due to the lower integration accuracy. Conversely, it is faster than the DGSEM on Gauss-Legendre nodes due to a less severe time step restriction and simpler numerical operator. To the author's knowledge, this is the first time for which a comparison of entropy stable DGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto and Gauss-Legendre has been performed for compressible, wall-bounded turbulent flows with separation.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive imaging of solute redistribution below evaporating surfaces using 23Na-MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation from porous media is a key phenomenon in the terrestrial environment and is linked to accumulation of solutes at or near the evaporative surface. The current study aims at improved understanding of solute accumulation near evaporating surfaces. Analytical and numerical modelling studies have suggested the development of local instabilities due to density differences during evaporation in case of saturated porous media with high permeability. These instabilities lead to density-driven downward flow through fingering, and thus a redistribution of solutes. To experimentally investigate this, we performed evaporation experiments on two types of porous media (F36 and W3) with intrinsic permeabilities that differed by two orders of magnitude. Using magnetic resonance imaging (23Na-MRI), we monitored the development of solute accumulation and subsequent redistribution during evaporation with a continuous supply of water at the bottom of the samples. Significant differences between the Na enrichment patterns were observed for the two porous media. The F36 sample showed an initial enrichment at the surface within the first hour, but soon after a downwards moving plume developed that redistributed NaCl back into the column. Average depth profiles of Na concentrations showed that the surface concentration reached only 2.5 M, well below the solubility limit. In contrast, the W3 sample with lower permeability showed enrichment in a shallow near-surface zone where a concentration of over 6 M was reached. Comparison of experimental results with numerical simulations using DuMux showed qualitative agreement between measured and modelled solute concentrations. This study experimentally confirms the importance of density-driven redistribution of solutes in case of saturated porous media, which has implications for predicting evaporation rates and the time to the start of salt crust formation.</description>

      <title>Near-surface coherent structures in an intense tropical cyclone: conditional eddies and vertical momentum fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermittency of coherent turbulent structures in the tropical cyclone boundary layer makes them challenging to fully characterize, especially regarding their impact on momentum dynamics in the eyewall. Furthermore, the fine spatial and temporal model resolution needed to resolve these structures has long impeded their understanding. Using the output of a large eddy simulation (with 31-m horizontal and 15-m vertical grid spacing), we investigate the three-dimensional structure of conditionally averaged eddies associated with extreme Reynolds stress events in the near-surface region of a category 5 tropical cyclone. For ejection events, we find (using two- and three-dimensional analysis) that the structure of the conditional eddy is a vortex core roughly inclined toward the direction of the mean flow in the inflowing boundary layer, outer and inner eyewall region. For sweep events, this vortex core is less coherent. The nature of the educed eddies found in this study suggests a similarity between the coherent structures in simpler wall-bounded turbulent flows and those in complex environmental flows.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber affects the lift of ray-inspired fins near a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rays and skates tend to have different fin kinematics depending on their proximity to a ground plane such as the sea floor. Near the ground, rays tend to be more undulatory (high wavenumber), while far from the ground, rays tend to be more oscillatory (low wavenumber). It is unknown whether these differences are driven by hydrodynamics or other biological pressures. Here we show that near the ground, the time-averaged lift on a ray-like fin is highly dependent on wavenumber. We support our claims using a ray-inspired robotic rig that can produce oscillatory and undulatory motions on the same fin. Potential flow simulations reveal that lift is always negative because quasisteady forces overcome wake-induced forces. Three-dimensional flow measurements demonstrate that oscillatory wakes are more disrupted by the ground than undulatory wakes. All these effects lead to a suction force toward the ground that is stronger and more destabilizing for oscillatory fins than undulatory fins. Our results suggest that wavenumber plays a role in the near-ground dynamics of ray-like fins, particularly in terms of dorsoventral accelerations. The fact that lower wavenumber is linked with stronger suction forces offers a new way to interpret the depth-dependent kinematics of rays and ray-inspired robots.</description>

      <title>High specific impulse electrospray propulsion with small capillary emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smaller capillary emitters to achieve higher specific impulse ($I_\text{sp}$) in electrospray propulsion. Four ionic liquids were characterized using capillary emitters with tip diameters from 15 to 50 $\mu$m. Smaller diameter capillaries produced smaller and more stable Taylor cones. This stabilization enabled steady cone-jet operation at significantly lower flow rates compared to larger emitters. This was unexpected because when the jet diameter is much smaller than far-field geometric features, the minimum flow rate is thought to be solely determined by the physical properties of the propellant. Using the smaller emitters and acceleration voltages of 10 kV, specific impulses up to 3000 s could be achieved with efficiencies above 50%, approximately doubling the $I_\text{sp}$ observed with larger emitters. For one of the liquids and the smallest emitters, the beam consisted solely of ions at the lowest flow rates, similarly to studies using externally wetted and porous emitters. Another important finding was that at sufficiently low flow rates, a significant fraction of the propellant fed to the emitter is not accelerated by the electrostatic field. These propellant losses make the time-of-flight technique unreliable for determining the $I_\text{sp}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pillar Induced Poiseuille-like Flow in Microfluidic Channels with Viscous and Viscoelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mucociliary clearance in mammals serves as the primary defense mechanism for removing particulate matter deposited in the pulmonary airways. Dysfunctions in this process are linked to serious respiratory diseases and can hinder effective drug delivery to the lungs. Microfluidic systems have emerged as a promising alternative for replicating lung functions in non-cellular physiological environments, offering a simpler and more controllable approach compared to in vivo and in vitro assays. Here we present a microfluidic platform featuring a closed-loop circular microchannel, integrating thousand 75 micrometer high magnetic pillars arranged in a square array. Made of polydimethylsiloxane and loaded with iron microparticles, the pillars are studied using scanning electron microscopy and magnetometry; their internal structure and bending response to a magnetic field are quantitatively analyzed. Using a combination of experimental data and finite element simulations, we found that the magnetic torque induced by permanent magnets dominates over magnetic force, generating fluid flow in the microchannel. Under the application of a rotating field, the time-dependent deflection of the pillars closely mimics the behavior of lung cilia, exhibiting alternating recovery phases and rapid whip-like movements. The velocity profiles of viscous and viscoelastic fluids are examined, and shown to display Poiseuille-type flow. By varying the viscosity of the fluids across four orders of magnitude, we identified a transition in propulsion regimes between viscous and elastic-driven flows. This active microfluidic platform offers a promising approach for modeling mucociliary clearance in drug delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering triadic interaction relationships latent in Mode A behind a circular cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence between multiple low-frequency components latent in the flow fields characterizes the nonlinear aspects of fluid dynamics. This study reveals the existance of the distinct frequency components and their interaction relation of the classical Mode A of the cylinder wake. Primaries are one-third of the Karman vortex shedding frequency (third-subharmonic) and bubble pumping, known as the previous study. However, when the spanwise domain size in numerical simulations is sufficiently large, their interaction is obscured by the presence of numerous frequency components. To address this, we introduce a process in which distinct frequency components gradually emerge by starting with a small spanwise domain size and then gradually increasing it from 3.3D to 4.7D, where D represents the diameter of the cylinder. From 3.3D to 3.5D, only the vortex shedding frequency harmonics are present. Third-subharmonic frequency appeared ranging from 3.5D to 3.7D. Bispectral mode decomposition reveals that the harmonics of the third-subharmonic frequency govern the flow in this domain size. The bubble pumping is emergence in the flow fields between 3.7D and 3.8D. The frequency component after this emergence is not only the harmonics of bubble pumping and periodic nature is disrupt. Nonlinear interactions between bubble pumping, the Karman vortex, and the third-subharmonic component complicate the temporal behavior of the flow field. Utilizing the constraint of the spanwise domain size, our approach effectively reveals the interaction relationship between frequency components inherent a flow field with a significant number of frequency components.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Two-Stage Reconstruction of Multiscale Subsurface Flow with Physics-informed Residual Connected Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The novel neural networks show great potential in solving partial differential equations. For single-phase flow problems in subsurface porous media with high-contrast coefficients, the key is to develop neural operators with accurate reconstruction capability and strict adherence to physical laws. In this study, we proposed a hybrid two-stage framework that uses multiscale basis functions and physics-guided deep learning to solve the Darcy flow problem in high-contrast fractured porous media. In the first stage, a data-driven model is used to reconstruct the multiscale basis function based on the permeability field to achieve effective dimensionality reduction while preserving the necessary multiscale features. In the second stage, the physics-informed neural network, together with Transformer-based global information extractor is used to reconstruct the pressure field by integrating the physical constraints derived from the Darcy equation, ensuring consistency with the physical laws of the real world. The model was evaluated on datasets with different combinations of permeability and basis functions and performed well in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, the framework achieves R2 values above 0.9 in terms of basis function fitting and pressure reconstruction, and the residual indicator is on the order of $1\times 10^{-4}$. These results validate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve accurate reconstruction while maintaining physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Shocking a Shock Wave for Nonlinear Summation of GPa Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring shock-shock interactions has been limited by experimental constraints, particularly in laser-induced shock experiments due to specialized equipment requirements. Herein, we introduce a tabletop approach to systematically investigate the excitation and superposition of dual laser-induced shock waves in water. Utilizing two laser pulses, spatio-temporally separated and focused into a confined water layer, we identify the optimal superposition leading to the highest combined shock pressure. Our results demonstrate that combining two shock waves each of $\sim$0.6~GPa pressure yields an overall shock pressure of $\sim$3~GPa. Our findings, suggesting an inherent nonlinear summation from the laser excitation process itself and highlights a new pathway for energy-efficient laser shock wave excitation.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Eddy -- Internal Wave Coupling. III. The End of the Enstrophy Cascade and Maintenance of Gyre Scale Potential Vorticity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess a prognostic formulation of triple coherence relating to energy exchange between mesoscale eddies and the internal wavefield and compare with observations from the Sargasso Sea. This effort involves updates to a theory articulated in M\"uller (1976) that balances eddy induced wavefield perturbations with nonlinearity using a relaxation time scale approximation. Agreement of the prognostic formulations with data is remarkable and is consistent with eddy-wave coupling dominating the regional internal wave energy budget. The goodness of this effort reinforces a prior hypothesis that the character of the internal wavefield in the Sargasso Sea is set by this interaction, which, in turn, serves as an amplifier of tertiary energy inputs from larger vertical scales that characterize internal swell. Extraction of eddy energy happens at the horizontal and vertical scales that characterize baroclinic instability and potential vorticity fluxes. With this knowledge and confidence, we then speculate on the role that this coupling plays with regards to mesoscale eddy dynamics in the Southern Recirculation Gyre of the Gulf Stream. We argue that this nonlinear relaxation effectively provides a local eddy enstrophy damping consistent with potential vorticity flux observations from the Local Dynamics Experiment. This happens at spatial scales somewhat smaller than the energy extraction scale and locates the end of the potential enstrophy cascade in the spectral domain as the energy containing scale of the internal wavefield. The dynamical consequence is that mesoscale eddy - internal wave coupling is responsible for the maintenance of gyre scale potential vorticity gradients.</description>

      <title>Simulations of entropy rain-driven convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The paradigm of convection in solar-like stars is questioned based on recent solar observations. Aims: The primary aim is to study the effects of surface-driven entropy rain on convection zone structure and flows. Methods: Simulations of compressible convection in Cartesian geometry with non-uniform surface cooling are used. The cooling profile includes localized cool patches that drive deeply penetrating plumes. Results are compared with cases with uniform cooling. Results: Sufficiently strong surface driving leads to strong non-locality and a largely subadiabatic convectively mixed layer. In such cases the net convective energy transport is done almost solely by the downflows. The spatial scale of flows decreases with increasing number of cooling patches for the vertical flows whereas the horizontal flows still peak at large scales. Conclusions: To reach the plume-dominated regime with a predominantly subadiabatic bulk of the convection zone requires significantly more efficient entropy rain than what is realized in simulations with uniform cooling. It is plausible that this regime is realized in the Sun but that it occurs on scales smaller than those resolved currently. Current results show that entropy rain can lead to largely mildly subadiabatic convection zone, whereas its effects for the scale of convection are more subtle.</description>

      <title>The Granule-In-Cell Method for Simulating Sand--Water Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of sand--water mixtures requires capturing the stochastic behavior of individual sand particles within a uniform, continuous fluid medium, such as the characteristic of migration, deposition, and plugging across various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Granule-in-Cell (GIC) method for simulating such sand--water interaction. We leverage the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the fine-scale details of individual granules and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for its continuous spatial representation and particle-based structure for density projection. To combine these two frameworks, we treat granules as macroscopic transport flow rather than solid boundaries for the fluid. This bidirectional coupling allows our model to accommodate a range of interphase forces with different discretization schemes, resulting in a more realistic simulation with fully respect to the mass conservation equation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulating complex sand--water interactions, while maintaining volume consistency. Notably, in the dam-breaking experiment, our simulation uniquely captures the distinct physical properties of sand under varying infiltration degree within a single scenario. Our work advances the state of the art in granule--fluid simulation, offering a unified framework that bridges mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The Karman-Howarth-Monin-Hill (KHMH) equation has been widely applied to scale-by-scale turbulent energy cascade studies in recent years, however, the forms and interpretations are not consistent. The present work generalizes to considering two different spatio-temporal points to reformulate the KHMH equation based on Reynolds decomposition and phase averaging. The unaveraged form and phase averaged form are detailed and interpreted. Then the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy are included in the KHMH equation to obtain the special form for homogeneous flows and isotropic flows.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of Microcavity Filling Regimes for Lab-on-a-Chip Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient and voidless filling of microcavities is of great importance for Lab-on-a-Chip applications. However, predicting whether microcavities will be filled or not under different circumstances is still difficult due to the local flow effects dominated by surface tension. In this work, a close-up study of the microcavity filling process is presented, shedding light on the mechanisms of the filling process using experimental insights accompanied by 3D numerical simulations. The movement of a fluid interface over a microcavity array is investigated optically under consideration of different fluids, capillary numbers, and cavity depths, revealing a regime map of different filling states. Moreover, the transient interface progression over the cavities is analyzed with attention to small-scale effects such as pinning. Besides the visual analysis of the image series, quantitative data of the dynamic contact angle and the interface progression is derived using an automated evaluation workflow. In addition to the experiments, 3D Volume-of-Fluid simulations are employed to further investigate the interface shape. It is shown that the simulations can not only predict the filling states in most cases, but also the transient movement and shape of the interface. The data and code associated with this work are publicly available at Bosch Research GitHub and at the TUDatalib data repository.</description>

      <title>Falling plates with leading-edge vortex shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new numerical method for thin plates falling in inviscid fluid that allows for leading-edge vortex shedding. The inclusion of leading-edge shedding restores physical dynamics to vortex-sheet models of falling bodies, and for the first time large-amplitude fluttering and tumbling are observed in inviscid simulations. Leading-edge shedding is achieved by introducing a novel quadrature rule and smoothing procedure for the Birkhoff-Rott equations. The smoothing error is controlled by a novel fencing procedure. We find a transition point between fluttering and tumbling that is consistent with previous viscous simulations and experiments, and other falling motions such as looping, autorotation are also observed as the plate density increases. The dipole street wakes behind the fluttering plates resemble those in experiments. We consider plates bent into V shapes and study the effects of density and bending angle on the qualitative falling dynamics. At small densities, increasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into fluttering, while at large densities, decreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into autorotation. In the autorotation regime, the magnitude of angular velocity increases as time cubed before it reaches a terminal angular velocity, and in the fluttering regime, the fluttering frequency scales as the $-1/2$ power of $R_1$, the plate density.</description>

      <title>Droplet breakup morphologies and the resultant size distribution in an opposed-flow airstream at different Weber numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study investigates the morphology and breakup dynamics of a freely falling drop in a vertical airstream using shadowgraphy and in-line holography. The in-line holography provides the temporal evolution of the volumetric size distribution of child droplets formed during various fragmentation processes at different Weber numbers (We). The droplet undergoes different fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in opposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings reveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag breakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the combined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate child droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the Rayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the interaction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation, characterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag and bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We = 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed at lower Weber numbers. In contrast, at We = 18.9, a dual-bag breakup occurs, where both bags inflate and burst simultaneously. This process generates tiny child droplets in the early stages, while larger child droplets form later due to the fragmentation of the rim and nodes, resulting in a bi-modal size distribution. We have performed a theoretical analysis using a two-parameter gamma distribution, which satisfactorily predicts the size distributions observed experimentally at different Weber numbers.</description>

      <title>Moving mesh FSI approach for VIV simulation based on DG method with AMR technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) remains a fundamental yet computationally
  challenging problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This study develops a moving mesh Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithm within a Runge-Kutta
  Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The viscous term in the compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is discretized using
  the high-order Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG)
  method. In addition to the above, key numerical advancements encompass
  the rigorous derivation of the Lax-Friedrichs (L-F) numerical flux formulation
  tailored for moving meshes, an enhanced AMR-driven nodal correction
  methodology designed for curved surface geometries,
  and the implementation of a ghost-node boundary condition treatment scheme
  to address dynamic mesh motion. Numerical validation proceeds through three phases:
  First, Couette flow simulations confirm the IPDG method's spatial
  convergence order. Subsequent analysis of unsteady flow past a cylinder
  demonstrate the AMR framework's efficacy in resolving vortex-dominated flow.
  Finally, six VIV benchmark cases are simulated using third-order IPDG discretization,
  establishing the proposed FSI algorithm's accuracy. Furthermore, synthetic jets (SJs) flow control is investigated through
  four frequency-variant SJs configurations. The results reveal that SJs can achieve completely
  VIV suppression at a low actuation frequency, while higher actuation
  frequencies reduce suppression efficiency due
  to the energy of the SJs is more in the form of acoustic wave.</description>

      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and investigate the stability of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports weak Casimirs forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket for the potential vorticity evolution independent of the details of the buoyancy as this is advected under the flow. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the weak Casimirs, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains to be understood. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled us to \emph{a priori} bound the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>
