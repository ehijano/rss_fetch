      <title>The size of the sync basin resolved</title>

Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to model the winding number as a sum of weakly dependent variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral light-by-light moulding in multimode fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling complex light waves to achieve desired behaviours or characteristics on demand presents a significant challenge. This task becomes even more complicated when manipulating speckled light beams owing to their inherently fuzzy intensity and phase structures. Here, we demonstrate that a weak speckled second-harmonic signal in a multimode graded-index fibre can be manipulated via its conservative interaction with a high-power co-propagating fundamental pump wave. Specifically, the spatial quality of the signal can be either enhanced or degraded by varying the pump's power or its modal power distribution. The underlying physical mechanism is the optically induced mode conversion, whose phase-matching can be controlled by the mode power distribution of the pump beam. This phenomenon enables new possibilities for manipulating complex light via material nonlinearities in multimode guiding structures. A striking example of this novel light-by-light control is the experimentally observed enhancement or partial suppression of the visible Raman Stokes cascade regulated by the second harmonic beam, while modulated by the mode power distribution of the fundamental beam.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal field theory for decision-making in multi-agent control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.</description>
