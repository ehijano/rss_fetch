      <title>Nonlocal loss of first homotopy in polyhedral approximations of Peano continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a Peano continuum $X$ is semilocally simply connected, then it has a finite polyhedral approximation whose fundamental group is isomorphic to that of $X$. In general, this fails to be true. It is known that the fundamental group of a locally complicated Peano continuum may contain nontrivial elements that are persistently undetectable by polyhedral approximations, at all scales. However, we show that such failure is not inherently local.</description>

      <title>The Eilenberg-MacLane Spectrum of \mathbb{F}_1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a very special $\Gamma$-space $X$, repeated application of Segal's delooping functor produces the constituent spaces of the associated connective $\Omega$-spectrum. In particular, by applying this construction to \textit{discrete} very special $\Gamma$-spaces (a.k.a.~Abelian groups), one recovers Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. The delooping functor is entirely formal, however, and can be applied to arbitrary $\Gamma$-spaces without any conditions. Work of Connes and Consani suggests that the ``field with one element'' can be fruitfully realized as a (discrete) $\Gamma$-space (which localizes to the classical sphere spectrum). This note computes Segal's deloopings of this model of $\mathbb{F}_1$. They are $n$-fold simplicial sets whose geometric realizations are the $n$-spheres, equipped with \textit{free partial commutative monoid} structures. Equivalently, they are the (nerves of the) free partial strict $n$-categories with free partial symmetric monoidal structures.</description>

      <title>Strong relations between discrete surfaces, poset-based connected manifolds, and normal pseudomanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some relationships existing between some particular mathematical structures: discrete surfaces coming from discrete topology and mathematical morphology, poset-based connected manifolds coming from discrete topology, and normal pseudomanifolds which are much used in discrete geometry and topological data analysis. We will also show that, even when poset-based connected manifolds are assumed to be simplicial complexes, and then supplied with many additional topological properties, they are not necessarily smooth. A set of sufficient conditions to ensure that poset-based connected manifolds are smooth will be provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we determine the rational homotopy type of the total space of the projectivization of the complex tangent bundle $\tau : \mathbb{C}^n \longrightarrow E \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^{n}$. We show that the total space $P(E)$ of the projectivization bundle $P(\tau): \mathbb{C}P^{n-1} \longrightarrow P(E) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^{n}$ has the rational homotopy type of $\mathrm{U}(n+1)/\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(n-1)$.</description>

      <title>The tensor triangular geometry of fully faithful functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</description>

      <title>Counting topological interface modes using simplicial characteristic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational approach for predicting the number of topological interface modes (TIMs) in hermitian systems using the spectral flow - monopole (SFM) correspondence is presented. The number of TIMs is determined by calculating the Chern number of a complex line bundle of local polarisation vectors over a phase space sphere surrounding a Weyl point. The Chern number is computed by constructing the simplicial first Chern class of a discrete vector bundle on a simplicial mesh. This approach is gauge invariant, derivative free, structure preserving, and robust to noise. The algorithm is shown to reproduce the expected number of TIMs for the case of equatorial fluid waves and the topological Langmuir cyclotron wave. The possibility of using this algorithm to analyse experimental measurements of bulk wave polarisations and predict the associated number of TIMs is explored in a synthetic example.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Type of the Space of Fibrations of the Three-sphere by Simple Closed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the moduli space of all smooth fibrations of a three-sphere by simple closed curves has the homotopy type of a disjoint union of a pair of two-spheres if the fibers are oriented, and of a pair of real projective planes if unoriented, the same as for its finite-dimensional subspace of Hopf fibrations by parallel great circles. This moduli space is the quotient of the diffeomorphism group of the three-sphere (a Fr\'echet Lie group) by its subgroup of automorphisms of the Hopf fibration, which we show is a smooth Fr\'echet submanifold of the diffeomorphism group. Then we show that the moduli space, already known to be a Fr\'echet manifold by [HKMR12], can be modeled on the concrete Fr\'echet space of vector fields on the three-sphere which are "horizontal" and "balanced" with respect to a given Hopf fibration, and see how the structure of this moduli space helps us to determine its homotopy type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.03006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Galois group actions on \'etale cohomology to prove results of formality for dg-operads and dg-algebras with torsion coefficients. Our theory applies, among other related constructions, to the dg-operad of singular chains on the operad of little disks and to the dg-algebra of singular cochains on the configuration space of points in the complex space. The formality that we obtain is only up to a certain degree, which depends on the cardinality of the field of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Natural operations in Intersection Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.04960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, that classify the singular cohomology groups of topological spaces, admit natural constructions in the framework of simplicial sets. The existence of similar spaces for the intersection cohomology groups of a stratified space is a long-standing open problem asked by M. Goresky and R. MacPherson. One feature of this work is a construction of such simplicial sets. From works of R. MacPherson, J. Lurie and others, it is now commonly accepted that the simplicial set of singular simplices associated to a topological space has to be replaced by the simplicial set of singular simplices that respect the stratification. This is encoded in the category of simplicial sets over the nerve of the poset of strata. For each perversity, we define a functor from it, with values in the category of cochain complexes over a commutative ring. This construction is based upon a simplicial blow up and the associated cohomology is the intersection cohomology as it was defined by M. Goresky and R. MacPherson. This functor admits an adjoint and we use it to get classifying spaces for intersection cohomology. Natural intersection cohomology operations are understood in terms of intersection cohomology of these classifying spaces. As in the classical case, they form infinite loop spaces. In the last section, we examine the depth one case of stratified spaces with only one singular stratum. We observe that the classifying spaces are Joyal's projective cones over classical Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. We establish some of their properties and conjecture that, for Goresky and MacPherson perversities, all intersection cohomology operations are induced by classical ones.</description>

      <title>Simplicial intersection homology revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intersection homology is defined for simplicial, singular and PL chains and it is well known that the three versions are isomorphic for a full filtered simplicial complex. In the literature, the isomorphism, between the singular and the simplicial situations of intersection homology, uses the PL case as an intermediate. Here we show directly that the canonical map between the simplicial and the singular intersection chains complexes is a quasi-isomorphism. This is similar to the classical proof for simplicial complexes, with an argument based on the concept of residual complex and not on skeletons. This parallel between simplicial and singular approaches is also extended to the intersection blown-up cohomology that we introduced in a previous work. In the case of an orientable pseudomanifold, this cohomology owns a Poincar\'e isomorphism with the intersection homology, for any coefficient ring, thanks to a cap product with a fundamental class. So, the blown-up intersection cohomology of a pseudomanifold can be computed from a triangulation. Finally, we introduce a blown-up intersection cohomology for PL spaces and prove that it is isomorphic to the singular one.</description>

Abstract: We construct a PROP which encodes 2D-TQFTs with a grading. This defines a graded Frobenius algebra as algebras over this PROP. We also give a description of graded Frobenius algebras in terms of maps and relations. This structure naturally arises as the cohomology of manifolds, loop homology and Hochschild homology of Frobenius algebras. In addition, we give a comprehensive description of the signs that arise in suspending algebras over PROPs.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips complexes of torus grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology of Vietoris--Rips complexes of finite grids on the torus. Let $T_{n,n}$ be the grid of $n\times n$ points on the flat torus $S^1\times S^1$, equipped with the $l^1$ metric. Let $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ be the Vietoris--Rips simplicial complex of this torus grid at scale $k\ge 0$. For $n\ge 7$ and small scales $2\le k\le \frac{n-1}{3}$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to the torus. For large scales $k\ge 2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is a simplex and hence contractible. Interesting topology arises over intermediate scales $\frac{n-1}{3}&lt;k&lt;2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. For example, we prove that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{2n,2n};2n-1)\cong S^{2n^2-1}$ for $n\ge 2$, that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n,3n};n)\simeq\vee^{6n^2-1}S^2$ for $n\ge 2$, and that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n-1,3n-1};n)\simeq \bigvee_{6n-3} S^2\vee \bigvee_{6n-2}S^3$ for $n\geq 3$. Based on homology computations, we conjecture that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to a $3$-sphere for a countable family of $(n,k)$ pairs, and we prove this for $(n,k)=(7,4)$.</description>

Abstract: We give a purely derivator-theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded chain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realized as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a cochain complex for ample groupoids $\mathcal G$ using a flat resolution defining their homology with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. We prove that the cohomology of this cochain complex with values in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ coincides with the previously introduced continuous cocycle cohomology of $\mathcal G$. In particular, this groupoid cohomology is invariant under Morita equivalence. We derive an exact sequence for the cohomology of skew products by a $\mathbb Z$-valued cocycle. We indicate how to compute the cohomology with coefficients in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ for $AF$-groupoids and for certain action groupoids.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>

Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <title>Gradings on nilpotent Lie algebras associated with the nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>
