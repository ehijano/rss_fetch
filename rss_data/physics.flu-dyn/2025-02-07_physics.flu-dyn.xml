      <title>Parametric reduced-order modeling and mode sensitivity of actuated cylinder flow from a matrix manifold perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for parametric proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin reduced-order modeling (ROM) of fluid flows that accommodates variations in flow parameters and control inputs. As an initial step, to explore how the locally optimal POD modes vary with parameter changes, we demonstrate a sensitivity analysis of POD modes and their spanned subspace, respectively rooted in Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. The sensitivity analysis, by defining distance between POD modes for different parameters, is applied to the flow around a rotating cylinder with varying Reynolds numbers and rotation rates. The sensitivity of the subspace spanned by POD modes to parameter changes is represented by a tangent vector on the Grassmann manifold. For the cylinder case, the inverse of the subspace sensitivity on the Grassmann manifold is proportional to the Roshko number, highlighting the connection between geometric properties and flow physics. Furthermore, the Reynolds number at which the subspace sensitivity approaches infinity corresponds to the lower bound at which the characteristic frequency of the K\'arm\'an vortex street exists (Noack &amp; Eckelmann, JFM, 1994). From the Stiefel manifold perspective, sensitivity modes are derived to represent the flow field sensitivity, comprising the sensitivities of the POD modes and expansion coefficients. The temporal evolution of the flow field sensitivity is represented by superposing the sensitivity modes. Lastly, we devise a parametric POD-Galerkin ROM based on subspace interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. The reconstruction error of the ROM is intimately linked to the subspace-estimation error, which is in turn closely related to subspace sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of three-dimensional boundary-layer stability to intrinsic uncertainties of fluid properties: a study on supercritical CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic uncertainty of fluid properties, including the equation of state, viscosity, and thermal conductivity, on boundary layer stability has scarcely been addressed. When a fluid is operating in the vicinity of the Widom line (defined as the maximum of isobaric specific heat) in supercritical state, its properties exhibit highly non-ideal behavior, which is an ongoing research field leading to refined and more accurate fluid property databases. Upon crossing the Widom line, new mechanisms of flow instability emerge, feasibly leading to changes in dominating modes that yield turbulence. The present work investigates the sensitivity of three-dimensional boundary-layer modal instability to these intrinsic uncertainties in fluid properties. The uncertainty, regardless of its source and the fluid regimes, gives rise to distortions of all profiles that constitute the inputs of the stability operator. The effect of these distortions on flow stability is measured by sensitivity coefficients, which are formulated with the adjoint operator and validated against linear modal stability analysis. The results are presented for carbon dioxide at a representative supercritical pressure of about 80 bar. The sensitivity to different inputs of the stability operator across various thermodynamic regimes show an immense range of sensitivity amplitude. A balancing relationship between the density gradient and its perturbation leads to a quadratic effect across the Widom line, provoking significant sensitivity to distortions of the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the density, $\partial^2 p/\partial \rho^2$. From an application-oriented point of view, one important question is whether the correct baseflow profiles can be meaningfully analyzed by the simplified ideal-fluid model...</description>

      <title>CaNS-Fizzy: A GPU-accelerated finite difference solver for turbulent two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CaNS-Fizzy -- Fizzy for short -- is a GPU-accelerated numerical solver for massively-parallel Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of incompressible two-phase flows. A DNS enables direct access to all flow quantities, resolved in time and space at all relevant continuum scales. The resulting numerical experiments provide complete data sets for the analysis of the detailed mechanisms underlying the flow, particularly the interaction between the chaotic and multi-scale dynamics of turbulence and the interface movement and deformation. The insights gained can guide the design and operation of various applications, such as boiling heat transfer, liquid-liquid extraction, gas-liquid reactors, absorption and stripping columns, distillation columns, liquid combustion appliances, in all of which the rate of heat and mass transfer between phases is proportional to the interfacial area. Fizzy's two-phase capabilities were implemented using the efficient, GPU-accelerated Navier-Stokes solver CaNS as base.</description>

      <title>Information-optimal mixing at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information through mixing.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>

      <title>A low-dissipation reconstruction scheme for compressible single- and multi-phase flows based on artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving compressible flows containing both smooth and discontinuous flow structures remains a significant challenge for finite volume methods. Godunov-type finite volume methods are commonly used for numerical simulations of compressible flows. One of the key factors in obtaining high-quality solutions is high-fidelity spatial reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for constructing high-resolution hybrid reconstruction schemes for compressible flows. This approach generates training data based on BVD schemes for supervised learning and employs ANN to create an indicator that pre-selects the most suitable reconstruction scheme for each cell, achieving the lowest global numerical dissipation. The numerical schemes under this paradigm are more computationally efficient than similar schemes within the BVD framework, as each cell only requires constructing a single interpolation function. Following this paradigm, a novel low-dissipation reconstruction scheme based on the MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme, named the deepMTBVD scheme, is proposed for compressible single- and multi-phase flows. The performance of the proposed scheme has been extensively verified through benchmark tests of single- and multi-phase compressible flows, where discontinuous and vortical flow structures, like shock waves, contact discontinuities, and material interfaces, as well as vortices and shear instabilities of different scales, coexist simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the new deepMTBVD scheme performs as well as the original MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme for numerical simulations of compressible flows while reducing computational time by up to 40%.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of the actuator line method for unsteady aerodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear theory for unsteady aerodynamic effects of the actuator line method (ALM). This theory is validated using ALM simulations, where we compute the lift generated by the harmonic transverse oscillation of a thin airfoil in uniform flow, comparing the results with Theodorsen's theory. This comparison elucidates the underlying characteristics and limitations of ALM when applied to unsteady aerodynamics. Numerical simulations were conducted across a range of chord lengths and oscillation frequencies. Comparison of ALM results with theoretical predictions shows consistent accuracy, with all Gaussian parameter choices yielding accurate results at low reduced frequencies. Furthermore, the study indicates that selecting a width parameter ratio of $\varepsilon/c$ (the Gaussian width parameter over the chord length) between 0.33 and 0.4 in ALM yields the closest alignment with analytical results across a broader frequency range. Additionally, a proper definition of angle of attack for a pitching airfoil is shown to be important for accurate computations. These findings offer valuable guidance for the application of ALM in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.</description>

      <title>Shoaling of Finite-Amplitude Rogue Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Gromeka Acceleration Vector for Dimensionless Womersley Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an analytical and theoretical investigation of the Gromeka acceleration field in a dimensionless Womersley flow, derived through the exact solution of the governing Navier-Stokes equations in phase space. By decomposing the convective acceleration into rotational and nonrotational components, the derivation highlights the dominant role of vorticity dynamics near the wall, where steep velocity gradients interact with the oscillatory axial velocity to produce localized radial accelerations. The solution reveals that the Gromeka acceleration mediates nonlinear interactions between harmonics, driving energy redistribution and boundary layer development under multi-harmonic boundary conditions. Complementary analysis of the kinetic energy gradient further delineates inertial effects, demonstrating their role in phase-dependent flow separation and reattachment. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding momentum transport and instability generation in pulsatile wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic growth of sea ice: assessing the role of salinity using a quasi-static modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea ice is a mushy layer, a porous material whose properties depend on the relative proportions of solid and liquid. The growth of sea ice is governed by heat transfer through the ice together with appropriate boundary conditions at the interfaces with the atmosphere and ocean. The salinity of sea ice has a large effect on its thermal properties so might naively be expected to have a large effect on its growth rate. However, previous studies observed a low sensitivity throughout the winter growth season. The goal of this study is to identify the controlling physical mechanisms that explain this observation. We develop a simplified quasi-static framework by applying a similarity transformation to the underlying heat equation and neglecting the explicit time dependence. We find three key processes controlling the sensitivity of growth rate to salinity. First, the trade-off between thermal conductivity and (latent) heat capacity leads to low sensitivity to salinity even at moderately high salinity and brine volume fraction. Second, the feedback on the temperature profile reduces the sensitivity relative to models that assume a linear profile, such as zero-layer Semtner models. Third, thicker ice has the opposite sensitivity of growth rate to salinity compared to thinner ice, sensitivities that counteract each other as the ice grows. Beyond its use in diagnosing these sensitivities, we show that the quasi-static approach offers a valuable sea-ice model of intermediate complexity between zero-layer Semtner models and full partial-differential-equation-based models such as Maykut-Untersteiner/Bitz-Lipscomb and mushy-layer models.</description>

      <title>VICON: A Foundation Model for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics via Vision In-Context Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) are models that learn operators across different types of PDEs using a few-shot, in-context approach. Although they show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each data point as a single token, and suffer from computational inefficiency when processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose \textit{Vision In-Context Operator Networks} (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing the rescaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</description>
